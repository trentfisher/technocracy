<h1>A few words about being``unofficial''</h1>

<p>
After almost 3 years of being the <em>official</em> web pages for
Technocracy, Inc., CHQ has started up
<a href="http://www.technocracyinc.org">their own web pages</a>.
Their pages will be a more flashy introduction to the organization,
while mine will remain an archive of past and present articles.
<p>
I call these web pages <em>unofficial</em> since I make no claims to
be an official representative of this organization.
A common disclaimer used throughout the organization, which applies to
these web pages as well, is as follows:

<blockquote>
No statement of policy is binding upon this organization
unless it is issued from CHQ Technocracy, Inc.
</blockquote>

<p>
However, almost all of the materials I present here are taken directly
from official, CHQ approved, literature.  The formatting, indexing and
organization of the files is my own, but I have made every effort to
faithfully reproduce the content of the material.
Any materials which are not CHQ approved should be labeled as such.
