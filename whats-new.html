    corrections/improvements to the html code of many pages.
<dt>11-Oct-97
<dd>
    Added <a href="periodicals/social-trends/123/index.html">Northwest
    Technocrat Newsletter, April 1994, No. 123</a>,

<dt>9-Sep-97
<dd>
    Added Clyde Wilson's article
    <a href="periodicals/social-trends/151/trendevents.html">
    Racing Toward Finiteness</a>.  Lois `published' this on the
    <a href="maillist.html">Technocracy Mailing List</a>, so I called it
    <a href="periodicals/social-trends/index.html">Social Trends Newsletter</a>
    <a href="periodicals/social-trends/151/index.html">Aug. 1997, No. 151</a>.

<dt>27-Jun-97
<dd>
    At the beginning of the month CHQ declared my web pages the
    <a href="official.html">official</a> ones for the organization.
    I finally got things updated to reflect this.
<dt>22-Jun-97
<dd>
    Well, it's been a while, but worth the wait.  I got a stack of
    floppies containing many issues of Lois'
    <a href="periodicals/social-trends/">Social Trends Newsletter</a>.
    Nearly all the articles from issues
    <a href="periodicals/social-trends/124/">124</a> to
    <a href="periodicals/social-trends/150/">150</a> are now online,
    plus a bunch articles from earlier issues.
    Lots of good articles!
<dt>30-Mar-97
<dd>
    Added three more of
    <a href="people/m-king-hubbert.html">M. King Hubbert</a>'s
    articles:
    <a href="periodicals/northern/17/where.html">Where Are The
    Technocrats of Yesteryear?</a>,
    <a href="periodicals/technocracy/a6/spconst.html">The ``Spirit of
    the Constitution''</a> and
    <a href="periodicals/technocracy/a12/mostprob.html">Determining the
    Most Probable</a>.
    Also found the correct location for Ron Miller's article

    Newsletter</a>.
<dt>22-Mar-97
<dd>Added the articles

    Facts of Life</a> by
    <a href="people/m-king-hubbert.html">M. King Hubbert</a> and

    With that, I have salvaged all I can off of the old floppies
    containing issues 317 to 329.  But I recently got another floppy
    containing issues 337 to 346...
<dt>8-Mar-97

    Northwest Technocrat</a>,
    <a href="periodicals/nwtechnocrat/337">No. 337</a> and
    <a href="periodicals/nwtechnocrat/346">No. 346</a>.

    will not be adding them until I get hard copies to compare to.

    Also added the ``master indexes'':
    <a href="master-index.html">sorted by title</a>,

    Technocrat</a> and I have, so far, gotten

    Also updated the information about <a

<dt>5-Nov-96
<dd>
    Lots of stuff has happened.  I now have access to a scanner with
    OCR software, and have been scanning like mad.  I now have many
    articles to be proofread and cleaned up for incorporation into the
    web pages (let me know if you want to help).  So far I have gotten
    <a href="pamphlets/man-hours-distribution.html">Man-Hours
    and Distribution</a>, <a
    href="articles/social-objectives.html">A Statement of the Social
    Objectives of Technocracy</a> and <a
    href="briefs/can-technology-destroy-us.html">Can Technology Destroy
    Us?</a> online.  Expect more shortly.
    <br>
    I also got the original Ventura files for the last four issues of
    <a href="periodicals/digest/">Technocracy Digest</a> from the
    editor, and have put them on the web pages (although they may
    still need some formatting fixes).
    <br>
    As a result of all this material flowing in, I am doing another
    restructuring, hopefully the last.  I am setting up a new <a
    href="periodicals/">index of periodicals</a> which will lead to
    indexes of individual issues, which will in turn point to the
    articles I have online.
<dt>12-Oct-96
<dd>
    Added the remaining text missing from the <a
    href="pamphlets/eng-cert.html">Entergy Certificate</a>.
<dt>9-Oct-96
<dd>
    Added the graph which had been missing from the article <a
    href="periodicals/nwtechnocrat/336/evolutions-hammer.html">
    Evolution's Hammer</a>.
    Other minor updates.
<dt>4-Oct-96
<dd>
    Added two new briefs:
    <A HREF="briefs/b54.html"><CITE>A Chance not a Choice</CITE></a>
    (#54) and <a href="briefs/b79.html"><cite>Two Worlds--One Real and
    One Economic</cite></a> (#79).  These were converted from the
    original Ventura files supplied by Cynthia Berge (so they
    shouldn't be subject to my poor typing or proofreading :-)
    There have actually been many minor changes over the last two
    weeks, but not much worth mentioning.
<dt>22-Sep-96
<dd>
    Hoo boy! I have restructured much of the information here.
    I moved the <a href="articles">articles</a> into their own
    directory, and introduced several new ones (good ones too!).
    Likewise, I moved the <a href="briefs">information briefs</a> and
    the various <a href="pamphlets">pamphlets</a> into their own
    directories.  I also set up a <a href="ghindex.html">search
    engine</a>, hopefully I will soon have enough information to make
    it worthwhile :-)
    In the process, I made minor adjustments to many pages.
    Existing URLs of moved pages should continue to work, but please
    update any links or bookmarks you have.
<dt>19-Sep-96
<dd>
    More sections of the <a href="pamphlets/eng-cert.html">Energy
    Certificate</a> have been added.
<dt>17-Sep-96
<dd>
    Added a <a href="todo.html">list of what is planned for these web
    pages</a>.

<dt>11-Sep-96
<dd>
    Added some new links to the
    <A HREF="reading.html">related reading</A> page.
<dt>9-Sep-96
<dd>
    <ul>
      <li>Updates to the <a href="calendar.html">calendar</a>.
	  This month's meetings in the Akron, OH vicinity have been cancelled.
      <li>Added a small page explaining my use of the word
	  unofficial, and also added
	  references to the various web pages which use the word
	  ``technocracy'' incorrectly.
    </ul>
<dt>3-Sep-96
<dd>
    <ul>
      <li>Added two events to the <a href="calendar.html">calendar</a>.
      <li>Updated the information on the <a
	  href="contacts.html">Contacts</a> page.
      <li>Updated the <a href="pubs.html">list of publications</a> so
	  that there are hyperlinks to the briefs I do have.
      <li>Oh, and added this page, too :-)
    </ul>
