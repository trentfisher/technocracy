<H1>Introduction to Technocracy: References and Notes</H1>
<P>
<H3>TECHNOCRACY STUDY COURSE</H3>
<P>
Technocracy is dealing with social phenomena in the widest
sense of that word; this includes not only actions of human beings
but also everything else which directly or indirectly affects their
actions. Consequently, the studies of Technocracy embrace practically
the whole fields of science and industry. Biology, climate, 
natural resources, and industrial equipment, all enter into the social
picture. Consequently, no one can expect to have any understanding of
our present social problems without having at least a panoramic view
of the basic relationships of these essential elements of
the picture. All things on the earth are composed of matter, and
therefore require a knowledge of chemistry. These things move,
and in so doing involve energy. An understanding of these
relationships requires a knowledge of physics. Industrial equipment,
as well as the substances of which living organisms are composed,
are derived from the earth; this requires a knowledge of geology
and earth processes. Man is himself an organism, and derives his
food from other organisms; hence, a knowledge of biology is necessitated.
<P>
The purpose of the Technocracy study course, which is for members
only, is not to give to any person a comprehensive knowledge
of science and technology, but rather to present an outline of the
essential elements of these various fields, as they pertain to the
social problem, in a unified picture. Neither are these lessons a
textbook. They are instead, a guide to study. The materials to
be studied are to a great extent already very well written in various
standard and authentic references and texts in the fields of science.
<P>
At the end of each lesson there is cited a series of references. If
one is sincerely interested in learning what Technocracy is, one of
the best means of doing so is by mastering the basic material
contained in these references, or its equivalent from other sources.
<P>
The scope of materials in this course of studies is so broad that
it is very doubtful that any group will have among its members a
single person competent to discuss all topics. It is quite probable,
however, that there may be individual members who are engineers,
physicians, and people with other branches of technical training.
The procedure therefore recommended for conducting the course
is that of the seminar method-each member of the group is i
student, and none is the teacher. Under this method there should
be a permanent presiding officer, but discussion leaders should b(-
chosen from among the group with topics assigned on the basis of
making the best uses of the talent afforded by the group. Thus,
for the matter and energy discussions, use should be made of members
with training in physics, chemistry or engineering. For the
biological discussions use should be made of physicians, or of people
having training in biology. For the mineral resources, people with
a knowledge of geology should be the preferred leaders.
<P>
The above suggestions are offered only as guides to the Technocrats
who are studying the Course. If special talent in the various
fields is not available, then any suitable leader can direct the
discussion, using the outline and references as sources of
information.
The important thing is to get a comprehensive view of the problem
as a whole, rather than of its parts as unrelated scraps of knowledge.
Following are descriptions of some of the books which Technocrats
read in connection with the Study Course.
<P>
<H3>SELECTED READING LIST FOR LAYMEN FROM THE LITERATURE OF SCIENCE</H3>
<P>
Dantzig, Tobias: <cite>Number, the Language of Science</cite>; A critical
survey written for the cultured non-mathematician. New York,
The Macmillan Co., 1930; viii, 260 pages, plates.
<P>
Mathematics has always stood in the popular mind as a symbol
of everything abstruse, remote, final, hopelessly rigorous and
correct: for this view we are still much indebted to the mathematical
idealism of Pythagoras and Plato. Actually, however, no science
has grown so slowly, followed more false leads, gone more astray in
bogs of speculation and sterile intellectual jugglery. This excellent
volume by a member of the United States Bureau of Standards can
be recommended to the interested layman, not only for the human
charm with which the author invests the `Queen of the Sciences, I
but for the substantial historical background it provides for a true
appreciation of mathematical thought. Dr. Dantzig begins with
`number-sense' and continues through the early gropings of arithmetic,
geometry and algebra; discusses the rise and growth of symbols; the
Irrational, Incommensurate, and Transcendental. Guided
by such great figures as Leibnitz, Fermat, Newton, Euler, Cantor,
Gauss, Dedekind, Hilbert, we journey from zero to the infinite:
yet, if we are wise, we will recognize--as does Technocracy--that
every step forward in this vast domain has not only been gained at
a heavy cost, but that the gain itself is measured ultimately, by the
success with which a new mathematical procedure can be utilized
(through science and technology) to solve some problem of the actual
world. If, as David Hilbert said, mathematics is a game played
according to certain rules, it is nevertheless a game played by fallible
beings in their unending efforts not merely to understand but to
dominate Reality.
<P>
Maxwell, James Clerk: <cite>Matter and Motion</cite>; reprinted, with
notes and appendices by Sir Joseph Larmor. London, The
Sheldon Press, (American distributors, The Macmillan Co.),
1925; xv, 163 pages.
<P>
This remarkable little book by one of the greatest mathematical
physicists of all time was first published in 1877: its reissue in 1920
is sufficient proof of the vitality inherent in all fundamental
scientific thought. It is recommended because of the clear and
rigorous way in which are developed the concepts of force, motion,
work, energy, and `material systems.' The treatment, although
advanced and frequently mathematical, should not prove a stumbling
block to anyone with a fair knowledge of physics and a genuine
interest in the methods of science-which are, ultimately, those of
strict observation, correlation, and exact quantitative measurement.
Particular attention is directed to the chapters on force and energy,
which are basic to all phenomena exhibiting motion, and thus
fundamental to an understanding of Technocracy. If the reader
will strive to appreciate and share Clerk Maxwell's lifelong interest
in the `go' of things, he will not only gain much from a careful study
of this book, but find it both possible and profitable to approach
social phenomena with something of the objective clarity which
has always distinguished the conquests of science, and which now,
through Technocracy, seeks to become effective in the domain
hitherto consecrated to the speculations of philosophy, the
animosities of politics and the values of economics.
<P>
Andrade, E. N. DA C.: <cite>The Mechanism of Nature</cite>;
being a simple approach to modern views on the structure of matter and
radiation. London, G. Bell &amp; Sons, Ltd., 1930; xii, 170 pages.
<P>
The seven chapters which make up this extremely readable book
by one of England's best known physicists consider such important
matters as heat and energy, sound, light, and radiation; electricity
and magnetism; the atom and the Quantum Theory. Professor
Andrade has remarkable talent in exposition, and the reader is
advised not to permit his enjoyment of the author's style to undermine
his attention to the matters in hand. Particularly noteworthy
is the chapter on heat and energy, which provides excellent material
to supplement the more abstruse treatment of those subjects in
Clerk Maxwell's book. The problems of heat transfer and energy
exchanges are well posed and clarified, as is also the theory of
probabilities as it applies in the kinetic theory of gases. Light and
radiation, sound and vibration (the latter being Andrade's special
field)
are skillfully discussed, with many examples from common life, and
references to such critical experiments as those of Michelson and
Morley. The chapters on the atom, and on Quantum Theory are
among the best short discussions of these rapidly changing subjects
thus far written for the layman. Largely factual in character--and
to this extent liable to correction through subsequent discoveries--
this little volume will nevertheless go far to establish a finer
appreciation of the importance of exact observation and close
reasoning 
in dealing with natural phenomena: of which so many are now
irrevocably part and parcel of the social macrocosm studied by
Technocracy.
<P>
Cajori, Florian: <cite>A History of Physics in its Elementary
Branches</cite>; including the Evolution of Research Laboratories;
revised and enlarged edition. New York, The Macmillan Co.,
1929; xiii, 424 pages.
<P>
There can be no better foundation for an understanding of the
physical sciences than a sound general knowledge of their history.
For physics proper such a knowledge is admirably supplied by this
short but scholarly and readable volume by one of America's foremost
historians of mathematics. The somewhat cursory treatment
of ancient and medieval science (which receives only thirty pages)
is followed by chapters on the Renaissance (Copernicus, Kepler,
Stevinus, Galileo, Gilbert, Francis Bacon), and on the seventeenth
and following centuries. The gradual progression of quantitative
physical ideas is illustrated by constant reference to the work of
such pioneers as Newton, Boyle, Black, Lavoisier, Laplace, and
Huygens; with each step forward the basic concept of energy is
more firmly established until, in the twentieth century, atomic
physics, radioactivity, and the brilliant formulations of Max Planck
set up a challenge to all old ways of thinking about the world and
the universe which the future will have to heed. Cajori's book is
recommended principally because it gives a sense of that inevitable
drawing together of scientific method and social thought which
forms the basic conviction of Technocracy and will prove its final
justification as a fertile approach to the problems of society
considered as a functioning organism.
<P>
Mott-Smith, Morton: <cite>This Mechanical World</cite>; an introduction
to popular physics. New York, D. Appleton &amp; Co., 1931; xvi, 233
pages, illus., bibl.; New World of Science Series, ed. by Watson
Davis.
<P>
If, as Technocracy has indicated in no uncertain terms, modern
society is becoming more and more a dynamic phenomena, an
understanding of the principles of dynamics might well be given
the right of way over the a priori speculations of traditional
economics and sociology. Mott-Smith's volume is admirably suited to
provide the intelligent, non-technical reader with a background in
this great branch of the physical sciences. Believing that `it is
important for our security and progress to know and understand the
physical environment in which we live,' Professor Mott-Smith
loses no time in getting at the heart of his subject. Hydrostatics,
inertia, force, acceleration; the laws of motion and gravitation;
mass, weight, and momentum; the conservation of energy and the
forms of energy; old beliefs and modern theories of physical
phenomena-these are a few of the things discussed, with adequate
references to the great pioneers from Archimedes through Galileo to,
Newton, Maxwell and Ernst Mach. The reader is made to realize
the importance of clear ideas and exact measurement in dealing
with natural phenomena, and the frequent use of homely examples,
such as the lever, inclined plane, pulleys, and projectiles, help to
drive home the basic concepts of dynamics--particularly those which
show the inseparable relationship between energy expended and
work accomplished. From the viewpoint of Technocracy, this
popular exposition of mechanics is commendable not only for the
skill shown in presenting difficult material, but because this
material, properly assimilated, will give the layman a keener
appreciation of the impersonal forces underlying even the last
stronghold of human values-society.
<P>
Cannon, Walter B.: <cite>The Wisdom of the Body</cite>; New York, W.
W. Norton &amp; Co., Inc., 1932; xv, 312 pages, diagrams, bibl.
<P>
Recommended by Technocracy because it is one of the few recent
books which describe that primitive biological prime mover, Man,
in the terms and with the special objective methods of science. The
author, Dr. Cannon, is not only one of America's foremost living
physiologists who has been widely honored here and abroad, but is
also a very gifted expositor of his specialty. In this volume,
intended for the layman, he reveals the human body as a mechanism
of extraordinary complexity and adaptability: with each of the
major functions--respiratory, digestive, circulatory and
reproductive--there are associated others that express themselves in
determinate ways, and in entire accordance with the principle of the
conservation of energy. The outcome of all this largely automatic
internal activity is the attainment and maintenance of what Professor
Cannon calls `homeo-stasis' and which he defines as `the coordinated
physiological processes which maintain most of the steady states in
the organism'--that is to say, which insure the proper stability
against environmental and physiological disturbances. The use
of the expression `steady states' is peculiarly appropriate, for it is
one of the terms widely used in thermodynamics and is employed
also by Technocracy to describe those social structures in which
that highly stabilized engine, Man, was the principal engine of
energy conversion. Professor Cannon, in a suggestive final chapter,
attempts a parallel between physiological and `social' homeo-stasis
which should not be taken too seriously: he does, however, recognize
that stability results from an even flow of the materials of the
organism. This is a shrewd approach to the view of Technocracy;
that smooth social operation depends solely upon the rates of flow
of the available physical energy as converted into use-forms and
services.
<P>
Petrie, Flinders: <cite>Social Life in Ancient Egypt</cite>; London,
Constable &amp; Co., Ltd., reissue, 1932; viii, 210 pages.
<P>
Sir Flinders Petrie needs no introduction to those with any interest
in, or knowledge of, archaeology or the history of human
cultures. To a thoroughgoing scholarship and extensive field
experience he adds what, from the point of view of Technocracy, is
of supreme importance to all engaged in historical research: keen
appreciation of the natural factors on which all human societies
depend, and by which alone they can function adequately. It is
for this reason that his small but remarkably well-informed volume
on Egyptian social life is included here: in six chapters we are
given a picture of an ancient society as it actually worked under the
special conditions imposed by nature. We see the framework of
this society, bounded by king, priest, warrior and slave; the
conditions of labor are set forth, and authentic details regarding
such
colossal achievements as the Pyramids enable us to realize both the
pathos and the terrific efficiency of the institution of human slavery
--that historic progenitor of technology and the machine. The
administration of Egypt and the intricacies of court life; existence
in town and country; legal, political and social customs (many of
them suggestively `modern'); and, particularly to be noticed, very
full accounts of commerce, manufacturers and trades, primitive
industries; weights and measures; construction and national
defense. In effect, what Sir Flinders Petrie has done in 200 compact
pages is to give us one of the most instructive accounts we know on
ancient society as a functioning organism rather than as a static
repetition of dynastic and political changes on the level of
nationalist chicanery. One reason for this stimulating dynamic
attitude
may be found in these words taken from the opening chapter: `It
is not too much to say that the discoverer is the maker of society.
Every step of discovery or invention reacts on the structure of
social relations. We can see this around us today; . . . . the present
use of electric power and of the internal combustion engine for
motors, will entirely alter the relation of town and country.' To
this extent at least, Technocracy gladly acknowledges Sir Flinders
Petrie as a worthy ally.
<P>
Voskuil, Walter A.: <cite>Minerals in Modern Industry</cite>;
Philadelphia, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1930; 350 pages.
<P>
Technocracy is able to recommend this book as containing one
of the most readable and concise summaries available of the mineral
position of the United States in relation to the rest of the world; 
and also because of the emphasis it lays upon the basic role played
by minerals in our present industrial social mechanism. The author's
occasional departure from the scientific terms of mass and
energy and his discussion of certain phases of the question in the
non-scientific terms derived from economic theory (in particular
those centering about `value' and `monetary costs') would be much
more objectionable had he not made clear his adherence to a broad
social welfare point of view. This view has led him to recognize
the imperative need for the conservation and wise use of mineral
resources, thus automatically invalidating his references to the
traditional Price System methods of evaluating and operating the
functional sequences of industry. It is to just such paradoxes and
contradictions in current thought on social problems that Technocracy
has consistently been directing public attention.
<P>
Leith, C. K.: <cite>World Minerals and World Politics</cite>; New York,
Whittlesey House (McGraw-Hill Co.), 1931; 193 pages.
<P>
Professor Leith is the head of the Geology Department of the
University of Wisconsin and one of the leading authorities on
world mineral resources. He is also a wealthy owner of iron
interests. This dual position of the author is faithfully reflected in
his book. Technocracy regrets that it can unreservedly recommend
only those chapters dealing with Professor Leith's proper scientific
domain: world minerals. In these he discusses, with the skill and
competence possible only to one thoroughly familiar with the subject,
the geographical areas of the earth with regard to minerals,
emphasizing the close interdependence of these areas, their various
strong points and weaknesses. Here he almost recognizes some of
the conclusions long held by Technocracy: that actual wealth is the
degradation of available energy into socially desirable use-forms
and services, and is thus measurable only in the quantitative units
derived from the physical sciences. The chapters on world politics
in relation to minerals, however, appear to have been written by
the author in his capacity as owner of large iron interests, for in
them he relaxes in scientific detachment, attempting to elucidate
ways and means for the further exploitation of mineral resources
according to the still accepted canons of the Price System and of
that `absentee ownership' so shrewdly analyzed by Thorstein
Veblen. Technocracy therefore discards these chapters as having
no relevance to the subject in hand, and as being inspired by an
attitude with which it has nothing in common.
<P>
Usher, Abbott Payson: <cite>A History of Mechanical Inventions</cite>;
New York, McGraw-Hill Book Co., 1929; 390 pages, illus., bibl.
<P>
This well-documented and generously illustrated volume is of
major importance to those who wish to acquire a correct insight
into the technological factors of modern life. Disregarding the
somewhat loose psychological speculations on the.nature of invention
in general (Particularly the references to the `Gestalt theory'
of human behavior) the reader may concentrate his interest in the
fascinating story that begins with the `eolipile' steam toy of Hero
and comes down to the internal combustion engine of the modern
motor car and aeroplane. Despite the steady efforts of man to
eliminate toil through mechanical aids, and the support of a growing
body of exact scientific knowledge (here again Galileo scored
many triumphs), the actual saving in human labor was negligible
until James Watt inaugurated the Age of Power by his improved
steam engine about the time of America's Declaration of
Independence. Professor Usher is particularly full in his discussions
of water wheels and wind mills, clocks and watches; the invention
of printing; textile machinery; and he has an unusually valuable
chapter on the mechanical genius of that great forerunner of modern
technology, Leonardo da Vinci. Other chapters on machine
tools, quantity production, and power complete a volume which
Technocracy can thoroughly recommend for the clear understanding it
will give intelligent readers of the slow progression of man
through the centuries of toil to the rapidly accelerating Epoch of
Power. Professor Usher's general point of view is well stated in
the following sentence: `The technological sciences furnish the
account of the most important single factor in the active
transformation of the environment by human activity'--provided that
by `human activity' we understand, not labor in the sense intended
by Adam Smith or even the Physiocrats on whom he drew so generously,
but `exploitation by man of extraneous physical energies
converted to his use through technological means.'
<P>
Soddy, Frederick: <cite>Wealth, Virtual Wealth and Debt, the
Solution of the Economic Paradox</cite>; New York, E. P. Dutton &amp;
Co., 1926; 320 pages.
<P>
This, the only volume in the group dealing in any specific way
with the subject of economics is included because the author is
primarily a scientist of notable achievements in the field of physics.
Nobel Prize winner in chemistry, discoverer of isotopes, collaborator
with Lord Rutherford in pioneer researches on atomic structure and
radio-activity, Professor Soddy attempts here a very interesting
thing: the reduction of economics to quantitative methods
of analysis. In view of the hasty charge of plagiarism brought
against Technocracy in connection with this book, it is desirable
to point out: first, that Soddy's earlier chapters (up to the sixth)
give a valuable account of the social implications of modern science,
particularly in the fields of thermodynamics and energy-exchanges;
second, that the necessity for interpreting social forces in terms of
dynamic physical forces susceptible to measurement and control,
is very pressing; third, that through inability, or unwillingness to
follow these vital premises through, Soddy still maintains the
traditional view of `wealth' as bearing some functional relation to the 
`value medium' of money rather than--as is basic to Technocracy--
to quantitative units derived from the conversion of available
physical energy into use-forms and services. This peculiar confusion
of thought is reminiscent of Tycho Brahe's ingenious effort to
reconcile the exploded Ptolemaic cosmogony with the Copernician,
or of Joseph Priestley's last ditch defense of the `Phlogiston theory'
his own experiments did so much to discredit. For this reason
Technocracy, however appreciative of Professor Soddy's valiant
and suggestive attempt to recast economics in a scientific form, must
qualify its recommendation of this volume by a warning which
may be thus generalized: Economic theory, as it has come down to
us from `yesterday's seven thousand static years,' can neither be
reconciled with, nor recast by, these methods of the physical sciences
now functionally dominant in our modern industrial mechanisms:
it must be discarded.
<P>
<H3>OTHER SCIENTIFIC, STATISTICAL, AND HISTORICAL REFERENCE BOOKS</H3>
<P>
The books herein listed are intended primarily to be read by
Technocrats in conjunction with the Technocracy Study Course
which points out the social implications of the physical factors and
laws described. The books are on two separate levels of
technicality--elementary, and advanced. Those on the elementary level
may be read by people not already familiar with mathematics,
physics, and chemistry. Those on the advanced level are primarily
for technically trained people who have a moderately advanced
knowledge of mathematics, physics, and chemistry. In no case
have cheap popularizations been included, and in all cases the books
presented are among the best that exist in the English language.
As better books become available this bibliography will be changed
so as to include them.

<H3><a name="note-veblen">A NOTE ON THE WORK OF THORSTEIN VEBLEN</a></H3>
<P>
There has been much discussion concerning the origin of the
body of ideas for which the term Technocracy now stands. Speculation
concerning this point has focused attention upon the work
of Thorstein Veblen as the source of inspiration, with particular
reference to the <cite>Engineers and the Price System</cite> as the
animating force. Such conclusions are quite contrary to the facts.
<P>
Shortly after the close of the World War, Scott was introduced
to Veblen by a mutual acquaintance who recognized,that the two
men had come to quite similar conclusions concerning the operation of
the social mechanism--Scott by way of physical science and
Veblen by hacking his way through the preconceptions of economics.
In the <cite>Engineers and the Price System</cite> which was written after
contact with Scott, Veblen indulges in extrapolations that are at
wide variance with the work since accomplished by Technocracy.
<P>
Veblen's position at that time is expressed in his published works
such as <cite>The Theory of Business Enterprise</cite>,
<cite>The Instinct of Workmanship</cite>,
<cite>The Place of Science in Modern Civilization</cite>,
<cite>Imperial Germany and the Industrial Revolution</cite>.
Scott was not at that time
acquainted with the works of Veblen and although Scott's published
statements are of a later date,. to those who knew both, during the
years immediately following the War when Technocracy
was organized, there can be no question as to the complete
independence of the two men and their theories. You cannot state
Scott's theory in terms of Veblenian formulations, nor can you express
Veblen's economic theory in terms of Scott's theory of energy
determinants.
<P>
Veblen was working at that time under the point of view expressed in
his note <cite>Why is Economics not an Evolutionary Science</cite>
which is found in <cite>The Place of Science in Modern Civilization</cite>.
Scott approached his work under the theories of physical science.
It was this approach by way of physical science to the problems of
explaining and operating the social mechanism that enabled him
to take the next all important step: the substituting of a metrical
for the prevailing `value' interpretation of the social mechanism.
In this manner, he was able to reduce such generalized concepts as
the accelerating productivity of the state of the industrial arts'
to quantitative terms with which physical science and technology
could deal.
<P>
In their treatment of `price' (Veblen in <cite>The Theory of Business
Enterprise</cite> and Scott in Part III of this book) and its bearing upon
the productivity of the industrial system it is difficult to distinguish
between the two points of view. To both, `price' is an independent
variable that intrudes and, through its controls, serves to throw
the system out of balance. Nor is there any important distinction
to be drawn from their handling of debt.
<P>
The body of ideas for which Technocracy acts as spokesman is
seemingly foreshadowed in the recent drift of modern common sense as
it has gradually taken form under the impact of physical
science and technology. Veblen was caught in that drift and he gave
it both acceleration and direction. Scott likewise was caught in it;
but being free of the preconceptions of economics, he was able to
turn his knowledge of physical science to bear directly upon the
problems of the physical operations of a social mechanism that
had already passed under the dominating control of science and
technology.
