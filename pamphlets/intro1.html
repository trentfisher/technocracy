<H1>Introduction to Technocracy: Definitions and Laws</H1>
<P>
<blockquote>
``In physical science... the first step is to define clearly the
material system which we make the subject of our statements. This
system may be of any degree of complexity. It maybe a simple material
particle, a body of finite size, or any number of such bodies, and it
may even be extended so as to include the whole material universe.''
-- James Clerk Maxwell, <cite>Matter and Motion</cite>
</blockquote>
<P>
<H2>DEFINITIONS</H2>
<P>
<H3>Mass</H3>
<P>
The quantity of matter in a body, or more correctly, the degree
of resistance to changes of state exhibited by a body. (<dfn>Weight</dfn>,
however, is an expression of the force with which the earth attracts
the body.)
<P>
<H3>Motion</H3>
<P>
Change of position (displacement of a body with reference to
another body). The determination of displacement involves two
quantities: the <dfn>length</dfn> of the path traversed between the given
points, and the <dfn>direction</dfn> of the path from origin to terminus.
(Vector)
<P>
<H3>Force</H3>
<P>
That which changes, or tends to change, the state of rest or
uniform motion of a body. It is only through such changes that
force can be detected or measured.
<P>
<H3>Energy</H3>
<P>
The capacity of a body or material system for doing work.
<dfn>Kinetic</dfn> energy: Possessed by a body in virtue of its motion;
summarized in the formula K.E. = <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>mv<sup>2</sup>,
where <var>m</var> is the mass of the 
body and <var>v</var> its velocity. <dfn>Potential</dfn> energy:
Possessed by a body in
virtue of its position or configuration. (The case of water at the
top of a fall, of a body suspended above ground, of a taut cord or
a coiled spring.)
<P>
<H3>Work</H3>
<P>
A force is said to do work when its point of application is displaced
in the direction of its application. (Cox) Expressed more
generally by James Clerk Maxwell, work is `the transference of
energy from one body or material system to another. The system
which gives out energy is said to do work on the system which
receives it, and the amount of energy given out by the first system
is always exactly equal to that received by the second.' Bear in
mind that, in practice, allowance must be made for `losses' through
friction, air resistance, and heat; these losses, however, added to
the total of energy effectively transformed into work, always equal
the total energy originally expended.
<P>
<H3>Power</H3>
<P>
The quantity of work done by a body or material system in a
unit of time; more tersely, a time-rate of doing work. This
scientific definition of power must be kept clearly in mind in all
discussions bearing upon the operation of physical equipment of
any kind: no reference to `power' is correct that does not state a
quantitative relationship between the factor of work and the
physical dimension of time.
<P>
<H3>LAWS</H3>
<P>
<H3>Newton's Three Laws of Motion</H3>
<P>
<ol>
  <li>Every body continues in its state of rest or of uniform motion
      in a straight line, except insofar as it is compelled to change
      that state by impressed force. (This is Galileo's Principle of
      Inertia.)
  <li>Change of motion is proportional to the impressed force,
      and takes place in the direction of that force. (From this law is
      derived the method of measuring force, which can be observed
      only in relation to changes of state in a body.)
  <li>To every action there is equal and, opposite reaction. (This
      states that all force is of the nature of a <dfn>stress</dfn>,
      that is, a mutual
      action between two bodies. Force could not exist, nor would it
      be necessary, if there were no inertia or resistance to overcome.)
</ol>
<P>
<H3>The Two Laws of Thermodynamics</H3>
<P>
<ol>
  <li>The total energy of a body or system of bodies is a quantity
      which can neither be increased nor diminished by any mutual
      action of the bodies, though it may be transformed into any one
      of the forms of which energy is susceptible. (Clerk Maxwell)
      This is the great Principle of the Conservation of Energy. Attempts to
      circumvent or violate it come under the head of <em>perpetual motion of
      the first class.</em>
  <li>The total energy of a material system (which includes its
      heat) tends to become uniformly distributed throughout the
      particles of the system. This process is described as `unidirectional
      and irreversible,' and from any determinate energy state of the
      system (provided that no indeterminate external force is introduced)
      it is possible to calculate 'the next most probable state' of
      the system. The final state of complete distribution or equipartition
      of energy is called the <em>maximum entropy of the system</em>. It is
      this law which in current physical theory is treated as a special case
      of the theory of probabilities: the state of a material system at any
      moment is a statistical expression of the combined (and individually
      indeterminate) states of the particles of which it is composed.
