<H2>I: THEIR SOCIAL RELATIONSHIP</H2>
<P>
The period since 1929 has been one of the most unique and one
of the most disturbing in the history of North America. The
events that have occurred since the stock market crash of that
year have provoked more competent social thinking on the part of
the American people, and have demolished more fixed tenets of our
American social and economic faith than those of any preceding half
century.
<P>
Up until the year 1929 the American public had been brought up
in the belief that any child with ambition and a willingness to work
would automatically be rewarded with material gain in direct
proportion to the effort and ingenuity displayed; that any office boy
might become the president of his corporation in due time provided he
displayed the proper virtues of industriousness, honesty,
respectfulness and thrift; that every boy had an equal chance of becoming President
some day; that the pathway to success was to be found in part through
proper education, and that educational facilities were equally
available to all; that work could be had by all who were willing; and,
conversely, that unemployment and lack of material success were
themselves indicative of the lack of those cardinal virtues of
industriousness, thrift, honesty, and the like.
<P>
In 1929 and the years that have followed, these tenets of our American
folk-lore have been rudely shattered, for during that time one-quarter
to one-third of all those willing and able to work have found it impossible to obtain employment and have consequently been forced
to depend upon their relatives and friends for support, or else upon
public governmental relief. During those years as many as one-quarter
of the entire population have been dependent upon the funds of the
federal government for food and clothing. Even the most independent
and rugged of our remaining individualists, the American farmer, has
found it increasingly necessary to rely upon the funds of the federal
government. Corporate business has likewise had to be bolstered up.
<P>
<H3>The People Watch</H3>
<P>
In addition to these experiences, the American public has watched
both government and business indulge in the curtailment of food
production and its wholesale destruction at a time of the greatest
human need in American history. They have seen their factories closed
at a time when a large fraction of the population has been in want
of the products of industry and when millions have been willing and
anxious to work. They have placed high hopes upon the promises of
their political and business leaders only to observe that in practice
the fulfillment of these promises has resulted in a virtual pauperization
of almost one-third of the population, with a standard of relief just
sufficient to maintain social quiescence. They have seen their industrial equipment constrained to operate at a level only slightly above
the lower limit of social tolerance. At the same time they have seen
the debts of the federal government increase from 17 to 40 billions of
dollars, and those of the state and local governments by some billions
more of so-called `emergency expenditures' without the slightest prospect
of the emergency becoming anything but worse.
<P>
More recently, they have witnessed the maneuvers of their political leaders
in the direction of international intrigue, the logical consequence of which
is war, as a means of diverting attention from their demonstrated incompetence
at solving their legitimate problems at home.
<P>
While the experiences of these last several years have been bewildering and in many instances tragic, it is impossible for the American
public to have lived through them without learning and without beginning to ask some profound questions: If our industry and our raw
materials are adequate for the production of abundance, why should
there be poverty and scarcity? Why should our plants be shut down
and our produce destroyed or, what is equivalent, shipped abroad?
If this production can be affected by automatic machinery, why should
men have to work, and if they do not need to work, why should they
have to starve?
<P>
These are elemental questions that the American people are asking,
first of themselves and then of their leaders in business and in government. Furthermore they are questions that demand an answer. So
far, the only answer they have received from these sources has been
one of the most determined and most costly propaganda campaigns
in history, in which the United States Chamber of Commerce, the
National Association of Manufacturers, the Machinery and Allied
Products Institute, the Automobile Manufacturers Association, the
American Iron and Steel Institute, the National Industrial Conference
Board, banks and other financial institutions, the spokesmen for scientific and engineering societies, innumerable trade journals, the press,
the radio, and the screen have all joined forces in defense of one variation or another of the proposition that 'Machines create jobs!'
<P>
<H3>A New Approach</H3>
<P>
As yet, the only organization on the North American Continent
which has analyzed this problem correctly and faced its implications
squarely is Technocracy, Inc.  When the public was told that prosperity
was just around the corner,' that we were, having merely another turn
of the 'business cycle,' that technological unemployment was nonexistent and, in the nature of things, impossible, it was Technocracy that
pointed out the correct nature of the situation.
<P>
The method of analysis employed by Technocracy, though long since
tried and proven in other domains of phenomena, was still strange and
unfamiliar in our last stronghold of ignorance and superstition--the
domain of human social phenomena. That method was the method
of physical science, the method that had conquered the power of the
wind and the water, that had mined and refined the minerals of the
earth, that had harnessed electricity, unlocked the secrets of the atom,
subdued disease, and which now at last was being employed to investigate and solve the problems of human society.
<P>
Like all witch doctors who feel their power slipping, our molders
of public opinion have not taken this intrusion lightly. Most of the
aforementioned propaganda has been offered in direct refutation of
statements first made public by Technocracy in 1932. Yet the subsequent
events--the only proof known to science--have consistently borne
out the validity and accuracy of that analysis, much to the confusion
of its critics.
<P>
Since, however, the <EM>method</EM> of that analysis, the method whereby
social phenomena may be examined in the light of physical science,
may not heretofore have been made sufficiently clear, it is proposed
to treat in some detail one of the more pressing of our contemporary
problems-that of technological unemployment-and certain other
problems contingent thereto.
<P>
<H2>II: THE DECLINE OF MAN-HOURS</H2>
<P>
<H3>Theoretical Considerations</H3>
<P>
In any given field of production whether of goods or of services,
there is a relationship between:
<UL>
  <LI>the number of units produced in a given time,
  <LI>the number of man-hours of human effort required to produce a single unit,
  <LI>the number of hours worked per man in that time,
  <LI>the number of men employed.
</UL>
<P>
In any given field of production let:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><VAR>q</VAR> <DD>be the number of units produced per year,
<DT><VAR>m</VAR> <DD>be the number of man-hours required to produce one unit,
<DT><VAR>l</VAR> <DD>be the number of man-hours per year per man,
<DT><VAR>n</VAR> <DD>be the number of men engaged,
<DT><VAR>e</VAR> <DD>be the total number of man-hours required for
    the entire production.
</DL>
<P>
<EM>A man-hour is defined as one man working one hour, regardless of
the occupation.</em>
<P>
From the above definitions the following relationships are obtained:
<P>
The total man-hours per year for the entire production are
the product of the man-hours per unit and the total number
of units produced in a year,
<P>
<VAR>e=mq.</VAR> (1)
<P>
Also the total number of man-hours per year is equal to
the total employees multiplied by the average hours per employee per year. Thus,
<P>
<VAR>e=nl.</VAR> (2)
<P>
Equating (1) and (2) together,
<P>
<VAR>nl=mq</VAR>
or
<VAR>n=(mq)/l</VAR> (3)
<P>
Thus we see that the total number of employees at any time in a
given industry is directly proportional to the man-hours per unit and
to the rate of production, and is inversely proportional to the number
of hours worked by each employee.
<P>
If at a given time <VAR>mq</VAR> is some finite amount, the number of employees,
<VAR>n</VAR>, may be made as large as one wishes provided the working
    hours, <VAR>l</VAR>, be made short enough.
<P>
<H3>Variation of Production, Total Man-Hours and Man-Hours per Unit, with Time</H3>
<P>
In general, in any given industry, production, man-hours per unit
produced, and total man-hours do not remain fixed but undergo
changes with time. If the total production, <VAR>q</VAR>, and the man-hours per
unit, <VAR>m</VAR>, are considered to vary independently, the total man-hours,
<VAR>e</VAR>, are uniquely determined by equation (1),
<VAR>e=mq</VAR>, at any given time.
the amount of work available is determined by total production and
by the human time required to produce each unit.
<P>
<H3>Growth of Production with Time</H3>
<P>
Every physical quantity that changes with time does so under very
definite physical limitations. Industrial production, being, a physical
process, therefore proceeds under ordinary physical limitations. One
of the most common types of physical growth is that in which a quantity
increases by a fixed percentage of itself in equal time intervals. This
is exactly equivalent to the increase in the principal of a sum of money
at compound interest, where the interest is compounded continuously
rather than per year. We shall speak of this as being a
<EM>compound-interest type of growth.</EM>
<P>
Practically all industrial. production in its earlier stages increases
with a compound-interest type of growth. From the Civil War to the
World War, American industrial growth was at such a rate as to double
itself once about every twelve years. This would correspond to an
instantaneous rate of increase of about 6 percent per annum.
<P>
One of the basic principles of any such growth is that it is physically
impossible for it to continue more than temporarily, for otherwise it
would soon reach such proportions as to require more materials than
exist in the entire earth. It also would outrun the capacity of the
public to consume.
<P>
It follows, therefore, that the next stage of physical growth must be
one of <EM>leveling off</EM>. The leveled-off stage may continue, or else be
followed by a declining stage in which the quantity may become
stabilized at a lower level than its maximum, or else continue to decline
to zero.
<P>
The point at which the transition from the first stage of growth
(that where the increase each year is greater than that of the year
before) to the second stage, where the growth is definitely slowing down
and the curve is leveling off, is called the <EM>point of inflection</EM> of the
curve.
<P>
<IMG SRC="mh-curves.gif" ALT="Theoretical curves showing relationship between production man-hours per unit and total man-hours for U.S." WIDTH=564 HEIGHT=454>
<P>
The point of inflection in the industrial growth of The United States
occurred at about 1915, and from that time on to the present the
growth of industry as a whole has been gradually leveling off. While
it is physically possible to step industrial activity up to a level
considerably beyond that of 1929, the time required to do so would not
be long, and thereafter it would level off again.  Hence it follows that
from now on, the most important characteristic of the growth of American
industry will be the dominance of leveling off over expansion.
<P>
<H3>Population</H3>
<P>
The foregoing remarks are equally applicable to population growth.
From 1790 till the Civil War the population of the United States
expanded at about 3 percent per annum. By 1920 that rate had decreased
to about 1.5 percent, and by 1936 to about 0.5 percent. According to
present estimates the population of the United States will
reach a maximum of about 135 million around the year 1950 and
will thereafter possibly decline somewhat.
<P>
<H3>Variation of Man-Hours per Unit with Time</H3>
<P>
The man-hours required to produce a single unit of any given commodity
or service vary with time in a manner quite contrary to that
of the growth of production. The man-hours per unit are a function
of the technology involved. It is an axiom in all machine design that
every time a new machine is designed to do a kind of work formerly
done by another machine or by handicraft, the new machine will in
general run faster, weigh less per unit rate of output, and require
fewer man-hours per unit than that used previously. Thus for the same
kind of production the man-hour-per-unit curve, with rare exceptions, always
declines.
<P>
In American industry the man-hour-per-unit curve has been declining
spectacularly in the past. A knowledge of present technology indicates
that if industry is only brought up to its own current best practice,
the man-hour-per-unit curve will descend even more spectacularly in
the future.

<P>
These two long-time curves-the growth of production, <VAR>q</VAR>, and the
decline of man-hours per unit, <VAR>m</VAR>, are shown in a hypothetical case
which is plotted graphically in Figure 1.  In this case the production
curve, <VAR>q</VAR>, is taken from the total energy consumed in the United States,
and hence reflects approximately the whole production of the United
States for the period from about the Civil War to the present.
<P>
The curve of man-hours per unit, <VAR>m</VAR>, used in this hypothetical case
is derived from the man-hours per unit in the manufacturing industry.
Both of these curves represent approximately what has been taking
place in the United States during the past three-quarters of a century.
The curve of total man-hours, <VAR>e</VAR>, is a computed curve. The total man-
hours for each year is given by equation (1) where <VAR>e=mq</VAR> for that year.
<P>
It will be noted that in spite of the increase of production, <VAR>q</VAR>, the
decline of man-hours per unit, <VAR>m</VAR>, has been such that the
product <VAR>e=mq</VAR>
(total man-hours) reaches an absolute peak and thereafter declines.
It cannot be emphasized too strongly that this is an event that does
not repeat itself. In any given long-time growth period this has to
happen, and it only happens once.
<P>
<H3>Examples of Decline Man-Hours</H3>
<P>
This maximum of total man-hours has occurred at different times
in different industries. In our biggest single industry, agriculture, the
all-time peak of employment, according to the U. S. Census, occurred
about 1910. Agricultural production, however, continued to increase
almost up till the present.
<P>
Complete data on railroads are given by the Interstate Commerce
Commission report, <CITE>Statistics of Railways in the United States</CITE>, 1930.
On page S-9 of this report is a table of average number of employees,
<VAR>n</VAR>, total man-hours, <VAR>e</VAR>, and the number of
man-hours per man per year, <VAR>l</VAR>,
for the Class I railroads of the United States for every year from 1916 to
1930 inclusive. The essential points of this table are reproduced in
Table 1.
<P>
The intermediate years are not quoted since they show values between
those given. Only the data for the principal parts of the curves
are quoted. The complete curves are given in Figure 2.
The total man-hours in Class I railroads reached an all-time peak
of over 5.701 billion in the year 1918. By 1929 this had declined To
4.347 billion man-hours. (<EM>By 1937 this had declined to 2.799 billion
man-hours</EM>.) The total employees reached an all-time peak in 1920
Of 2,022,832.  By 1929 this had declined to 1,660,850. (<EM>By 1937 this had
declined to 1,114,663.</EM>) In the meantime the number of hours worked
per employee per year declined more or less steadily from 3,100.2 in
1916 to 2,617.2 in 1929, (<EM>and to 2,511.6 in 1937</EM>). Railroad haulage,
however, both in ton-miles and car-miles reached an all-time peak in
1929 (<CITE>Statistical Abstract of the U. S.</CITE>).

(U.S. B. L. S., Bull. 593)
</PRE>
<P>
Table II contains the complete data on production and employment
in the assembly plants of the electric lamp industry for the years from
1920 to 1931 inclusive, as given by the U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics,
Bulletin No. 593. It will be noted that in this industry the employees,
<VAR>n</VAR>, declined from 17,283 in 1920 to 5,817 in 1931.  This means that the
all-time peak of employment must have occurred at or prior to 1920.
The production, <VAR>q</VAR>, meanwhile rose from 362,100,000 in 1920 to
503,300,000 in 1931. The man-hours per lamp, <VAR>m</VAR>, declined steadily
throughout the period, from 0.0998 man-hours per lamp in 1920 to
0.0227 in 1931, a drop Of 77.2 percent.
<P>
<H3>All Manufacturing Industries</H3>
<P>
Fairly complete data have been obtained on the whole manufacturing
industries of the United States from the <CITE>U. S. Census of Manufacturing</CITE>
and the <CITE>Statistical Abstracts of the U. S.</CITE> for the census years
from 1899 to 1929. Approximate figures have been obtained for
manufacturing since 1929 from various sources-principally the U. S.
Bureau of Labor Statistics. What was sought in this instance were
curves of total production, <VAR>q</VAR>, total wage earners,
<VAR>n</VAR>, man-hours per unit 
produced, <VAR>m</VAR>, total man-hours, <VAR>e</VAR>, and the man-hours
per man per year, <VAR>l</VAR>.
<P>
Some of these quantities, notably the production, <VAR>q</VAR>, had to
be obtained indirectly from the data given by the <CITE>Census</CITE>. There is no fixed
unit by which the production of miscellaneous articles may be
measured, so the production figures must represent a composite of all
manufacturing industries. There are several ways of arriving at an estimate
of <VAR>q</VAR>. One is by the installed horsepower of prime movers in the
manufacturing plant. If it be assumed that the load factor has not
been declining, then the production will increase as fast as, or faster than,
the increase in installed horsepower of prime movers.
<P>
Another method of obtaining an estimate is by the growth curve
of total energy. Since energy is used in driving all industrial
equipment, and since the output per unit of energy is constantly
increasing with time, it is conservative to assume that manufacturing production
has increased at least as fast as the increase in the use of enemy.
Another approach is a monetary one. Let <VAR>v</VAR> equal the value of a
given quantity, <VAR>q</VAR>, of products, and <VAR>p</VAR> their price per unit. Then,
<P>
<VAR>q=v/p</VAR> (4)
<P>
If the total value of all manufactured products is known and a
wholesale price index is available, a relative value of <VAR>q</VAR> for
succeeding years may be obtained.
<P>
<H3>A Long-Term Trend</H3>
<P>
In the case of the manufacturing industries all of the above methods
give substantially the same results, namely, that from 1899 to 1920 the
production, <VAR>q</VAR>, increased by a factor of from 3-5 to 4.0. The last named
method was used merely because it happened to be most convenient.
<P>
The length of the working week, <VAR>l<SUB>w</SUB></VAR>, has been
taken from the study entitled
<CITE>Machinery, Employment and Purchasing Power</CITE>
by the National Industrial Conference Board, and represents the
average number of hours actually worked as computed from payroll
figures, instead of the nominal length of the working week. All other figures were
either obtained directly or were computed by means of the foregoing
equations from data given. These are given in Table III and shown
graphically in Figure 3.

Here, as before, the production, <VAR>q</VAR>, mounted steadily to an all-time peak
in 1929. The man-hours per unit in the meantime declined steadily from 1889
to the present. The total man-hours, which is the product of the man-hours
per unit and the number of units produced, reached an all-time peak in the
year 1919, and has been fluctuatingly declining ever since.
In spite of the continued shortening of the hours of labor and the increase
in production, it is significant to note that the all-time peak in the number of
wage earners employed in the manufacturing industries was also reached in
the year 1919.
<P>
Complete data on cigarette production and employment are given
in <CITE>Production, Employment and Productivity in 59 Manufacturing
Industries</CITE>, WPA National Research Project. The curves for this
industry are given in Figure 4, and the figures for specific years are given
in Table IV. (See also photographs on inside rear cover.)
<P>
While the foregoing are only specific instances, they happen to
embrace the major part of the industrial activity of the United States and 
afford ample verification of the theoretical considerations set forth
earlier in this paper. Since the same type of processes are occurring
in every field of endeavor (witness the high-speed accounting
machinery of the International Business Machine Corporation, for instance),
it follows that the processes given somewhat in detail for some of our
major industries must also be true of others for which complete data
have not been obtained.
<P>
This latter conclusion is supported by the fact that, while production
is estimated by the U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics to have risen
from 62 percent of 1929 in 1932 to somewhat more than 80 percent
by early 1936, the unemployment, which is estimated to have been
14,520,000 in March, 1933, was still approximately 12,000,000 in early
1936 (U. S. Bur. Lab. Stat.) in spite of a reduction from a 48- to a 39-
hour week in the meantime. (The number of new employables is
increasing meanwhile at the rate of about 600,000 per year.)
<P>
Since labor-saving devices are certainly going to continue to be installed in
the future with a consequent continued decline in the man-hours per unit of
production, and since production itself can only be increased temporarily
before leveling off again, it follows that the curve of total man-hours will,
with only temporary reversals, be characterized by a continuous decline into
the indefinite future.

<P>
That this need not necessarily imply unemployment may be seen
when one recalls from equation (3) that the number employed is
<P>
<VAR>n=(mq)/l</VAR>
<P>
If I be made short enough any number, <VAR>n</VAR>, may be given
employment, and there need be no unemployment whatsoever. It might be
remarked that a four-hour day is not at all to be unexpected in the
near future.  For the present, with production at 1929 levels, a day
of somewhat longer than this would suffice to re-employ those now
out of work.
<P>
<H3>America Faces a New Problem</H3>
<P>
It cannot be emphasized too strongly that the trends we are describing
are long-time trends and were thoroughly evident prior to 1929.
These trends are in nowise the result of the present depression, nor
are they the result of the World War. On the contrary, the present
depression is a collapse resulting from these long-term trends.
<P>
It is further to be emphasized that there is nothing in any of these
trends corresponding to the economists' concept of a `business cycle.'
The steady growth of population and the steady decline of man-hours
per unit are both non-cyclical phenomena, and they do not repeat
themselves. Neither has the mean growth of production exhibited any
repetitions, nor has the curve of total man-hours, other than by minor
zigzag oscillations. It rose steadily to a maximum and then steadily
declined. We would like to emphasize that this ensemble of events
has only occurred once in American history and, furthermore, it is
absolutely certain that it will never occur again. Consequently all
interpretations of the present situation as merely a recurrence of a
situation that has been happening at intervals in the past, are
basically fallacious and worthy of no serious consideration.
<P>
<H2>III: DISTRIBUTION UNDER A PRICE SYSTEM</H2>
<P>
<H3>The Factor of Ownership</H3>
<P>
In the light of the foregoing discussion the answer seems simple
and obvious. If it is possible to completely eliminate unemployment by
a suitable reduction of the hours of labor per person, why
not make the reduction and be done with it?
<P>
This would be simple enough were it not for the monetary aspects
of the problem. Therein lies the difficulty.  As it happens, all of our
social and industrial operations are conducted in accordance with the
rules of the game of the Price System. According to these rules,
everything of <EM>value</EM> must be <EM>owned</EM> either by
individuals or by corporations.
Distribution is then accomplished by the mechanism of trade wherein
owners exchange property rights over goods and services.
<P>
In the pioneer days it was customary for the great majority of our
citizens to be property owners, and most of our industrial production
at that time came from small, individually owned, industrial
establishments. As our industry has grown there has been a
corresponding metamorphosis in its ownership. Large units have proven more
efficient and have progressively displaced small units. In the process
the individual owner has been liquidated and his place taken by the
corporation. The ownership and control of corporations has been
pyramided more and more into the hands of a minute fraction of our
total population.
<P>
With this growth of industrialization there has been an increased
urbanization of the population until in 1938 out of 130 million people
in the United States only 32 million lived on the farms, and all, even
the farmers, were directly dependent upon the products of industry.
<P>
With the pyramiding of the ownership of the means of production
into a small number of hands, there has resulted a large and
ever-increasing fraction of the population whose ownership of property, 
aside from personal effects, is sensibly zero, yet these people, in order
to live, must be able to acquire the products of industry-food,
clothing, housing, transportation, and the like. Since it is a Price System 
rule that these things can only be acquired by trade, and since all
that these people have to offer is their personal service-their
man-hours then it follows that the consuming power of the great bulk of
our population is directly geared to the income that can be acquired
from the marketing of man-hours of labor.
<P>
<H3>Values</H3>
<P>
Another fundamental rule of all Price System exchange is that the
<EM>value</EM> of a thing, that is the amount of another commodity or of money
that is exchangeable for it, varies with its <EM>scarcity</EM>. Air, for example,
has no value because it is abundant and no way has yet been found
to render it scarce. Water has value only in regions where it is scarce.
The values of farm products are highest following droughts or other
forms of crop curtailment.
<P>
The same is true of all exchange on a value basis; it is the
fundamental rule of a Price System. In fact a Price System is defined as any 
social system whatever which effects its distribution of goods and services
on the basis of commodity evaluation. When goods are scarce, values and
prices are high; when goods become abundant, values decline,
approaching the limit zero as the abundance approaches the saturation 
of the physical ability to consume.
<P>
Now, it has already been indicated that the great majority of our
population have nothing to sell except themselves, or their man-hours.
Man-hours, however, when for sale in the market place, are no whit
different from shoes or potatoes. If they are abundant their price, in
this case wages and salaries, goes down.
<P>
This would be true in any case just from competition, but it is
greatly accentuated in those occupations most affected by technological
advancement. Here the fundamental discrepancy arises from the fact
that man-hours are competing not only with themselves but with
kilowatt-hours developed from coal and water power. Physically, a
man-hour represents a certain small amount of energy. A kilowatt-hour
represents 13 times as much energy as that developed by a strong
man working one hour. Yet a kilowatt-hour can be bought at a
commercial rate of about one cent, while man-hours marketed at 25
cents each constitute starvation wages. Furthermore, it is an axiom of
machine design that in any process wherein the same operations are
repeated over and over again indefinitely, a machine can always be
devised that can do the job better, faster, and cheaper than any
human being.
<P>
The result of all this is that while it is physically possible, and in
fact already a <EM>fait accompli</EM>, that our social mechanism can be
operated while requiring of each of its members only a limited number
of hours of service per day, it is impossible under Price System rules
to pay them a living wage in exchange for these services. The
unavoidable consequence, if the Price System rules are to be
preserved, is that the unemployed must be kept quiet, which requires
that they be fed and clothed at the minimum standard necessary to
achieve that result.
<P>
Since it would remove the keystone of our whole social organization
and constitute a violation of its fundamental article of faith which
states that it is contrary to the will of God that man should receive
something for nothing, for the unemployed to receive relief without
working for it, it manifestly becomes necessary that work be provided
for which wages can be paid. This work, however, must in no manner
interfere with the activities of legitimate business, and the average
wages paid for it must be below the average paid by legitimate
business so that there will be no tendency for anyone to seek to
better his social position by going on relief.
<P>
All this, so far as it concerns the destitute, has become familiar
enough to the people of the North American Continent over the last
several years and need not be dwelt upon further here.
<P>
<H3>Man-Hours and Income</H3>
<P>
There is, however, another side to the picture that demands
consideration. The industrial production of goods and services is a
physical process and consumption is also a physical process.  Contrary
to all the textbooks of economics, which state that human wants are
insatiable, the fact is that human beings, regardless of income, can
only consume a limited amount of food per day, can only wear one
outfit of clothing at a time, and so with all other forms of
consumption. The result is that when the income of an individual or
family reaches a certain size, this saturation is produced and any
further income goes into non-consuming expenditures or else, into
savings. Incomes smaller than this critical amount are almost all
spent for consumption, and savings from them are negligible. Above
this critical amount the fraction of the income saved increases rapidly.
<P>
The transition between the small incomes and the large, between
those with negligible and those with large savings is, of course,
gradual, but it may be taken arbitrarily at about $5,000 per family.
Using this figure as an arbitrary division between large and small
incomes, we find, according to the Brookings Institution study,
America's Capacity to Consume, that in 1929 out of a total Of 27 millions of
families in the United States, 25 million, or 91 percent had incomes
less than $5,000 and 2 million, or 9 percent, had incomes greater than
this amount. Yet of the total savings of 15.1 billions of dollars, 12.5
billions were made by the 9 percent of the families whose incomes
were greater than $5,000.
<P>
Merely because they constitute such an overwhelming majority it is
the people with small incomes who do most of the consuming of the
products of industry, and since these people spend essentially their
entire incomes for consumption, we may say that industry runs or
shuts down on the basis of the aggregate total of the small incomes.
If these are increasing, consumption increases and industrial
production increases; if these are decreasing, consumption decreases
and industry begins to shut down.
<P>
<H3>The Problem of Income</H3>
<P>
The small incomes, however, are predominantly derived from the
marketing of man-hours of personal service, and we have already seen
that when available man-hours exceed the requirement for man-hours
their price goes down. This in turn curtails small incomes which then
leads to the stagnation of industrial operation.
If we let <VAR>e</VAR> be the total of all man-hours marketed in a given year at
an average wage of <VAR>w</VAR>, and <VAR>i</VAR> be the total income
received from that source, then
<P>
<VAR>i=we.</VAR>                         (5)
<P>
If this income is all spent for goods and services at an average price
<VAR>p</VAR>, then the number of units <VAR>c</VAR> that can be consumed is
<P>
<VAR>C=i/p=(we)/p</VAR>                (6)
<P>
But on the average, production must approximately equal consumption so
that the number of units <VAR>q</VAR> produced per year must equal the
units <VAR>c</VAR> consumed, and
<P>
<VAR>q=c=(we)/p</VAR>          (7)
<P>
This is necessarily true of that part of production and consumption
accounted for by the recipients of small incomes, but since these are
responsible, because of their great superiority in numbers, for the
bulk of the consumption of the products of industry, it also is the
controlling factor of industrial production.
<P>
We already know that with production constant or even increasing,
he total man-hours <VAR>e</VAR> are decreasing. Consequently from equation (7)
at any given price level, <VAR>p</VAR>, the consumption can only equal production
provided the total income <VAR>i</VAR> is proportional to the production.
This is is only possible provided, that wage rates be increased in proportion to
the decline of total man-hours. Were this done purchasing power could
be maintained adequate for any arbitrary level of production, and
with zero unemployment. If it is not done, purchasing power will
decline, the spectre of unemployment will remain and will become
aggravated with time, and production will again shut down.
<P>
This leads us to the significant conclusion that in order to maintain
production the public must be paid enough purchasing power to buy an the goods
reduced, independently of the amount of work done per man or woman,
or whether they work at all or not.
<P>
Yet if we supply this purchasing power in the only legitimate Price
System manner, namely, in payment for man-hours of services rendered
on the basis of the market value of man-hours, we find the purchasing
power of the vast majority of our population becoming inadequate to
maintain industrial operation. So that not only is this a problem of
he individual consumer; it is the life-and-death problem of political
government and business.
<P>
<H3>The Flow of Money</H3>
<P>
Still another way of approaching the same problem is by means of
following the circulatory flow of money. Let us lump all productive
and distributive enterprises together under the term industry and all
consumers together as the consumer. In a given year the consumer
spends a certain amount of money for the goods and services produced.
This constitutes the income received by industry.
<P>
A part of this income received from the consumer, industry distributes
through wages and salaries, royalties, rent, interest, and dividends
directly back to the consumer again. A part is retained as surplus, a
part goes into the hands of corporate financial institutions, and a part
is paid as taxes, the latter being distributed principally as salaries to
consumers.
<P>
Of the money paid by industry directly or indirectly to the consumer,
about half goes to the 9 percent with large incomes and the
remaining half to the 91 percent with small
incomes. About 20 percent of all individual incomes is `saved' and
does not become available
directly for a second purchase of consumers goods and services from
industry. The fraction withheld by industry itself as surplus is
likewise withdrawn from immediate re-use as consumer purchasing power.
<P>
We thus see that if industry operates profitably and any of its income
is withheld either as surplus or by financial institutions from
becoming consumer income, and if individual incomes are in part
withheld from direct purchases of the products of industry, the income
of the public after each circulation will become less than it was the
time before, and the monetary flow will be rapidly `dried up.' Unless
this deficit is somehow made up elsewhere, industry will shut down
as a result.
<P>
The customary way for the deficit to be made up is by investment
into new industrial plant and equipment. For example, if a billion
dollars which is withheld in one of those ways is spent on a new plant,
it goes out as wages, salaries, and the like into consumer income and
is available for further purchase of consumer goods. The financing
of new plant is commonly affected through bank loans, bonds, or
mortgages, all of which constitute new debt, and hence represent an
actual increase of the money in circulation; or new plant can be built
with money saved up as corporate surplus, which by this means is fed
back into the channel of consumer purchasing power.
<P>
<H3>Decline of Interest Rate and Consumer Income</H3>
<P>
In this connection it should be pointed out that the common
denominator of all kinds of money, except the negligible amount of
gold, is debt. Governmental currency is the government's promise to
pay; a bank deposit is the debt owed by the banker to the depositor;
and a bond is a certificate of debt from the issuer to the purchaser.
Thus if a million dollars worth of bonds be issued and marketed,
the total debt, or money, in circulation is increased by roughly a
million dollars. Hence debt and money can be created out of nothing.
Debt can also be annihilated into nothing, the call of a loan or of a
bond issue being such an instance.
(For elaboration of this point see <CITE>Wealth, Virtual Wealth and
Debt</CITE> by Frederick Soddy, E. P. Dutton and Company, N. Y.)
<P>
Thus from what we have seen, if industry, financial institutions,
and individuals save, the savings can be reinvested into industry
through the mechanism of new debt creation, and if the investment
is used to build new industrial equipment the money then circulates
back to consumer income and makes up the deficit created by the
initial withdrawal.
<P>
This, in fact, is what did happen in the growth of American industry
up until about the time of the World War. During that time 
our industry was growing at a rate such that its output doubled every
12 years. But that was also the period for which an expansion of
industry meant an expansion of employment.
<P>
Now let us consider what happens when the discrepancy between
the amount of the large incomes and that of the small becomes so
great that the amount withdrawn as savings is too large to be absorbed
by new industry. For example, when the consumer income (chiefly
the small incomes) becomes inadequate to keep the existing plant
from operating to capacity, investments into new industrial plant have
little probability of proving profitable. Consequently such investments
are, in general, not made.
<P>
Under these conditions new debt is not issued at a rate equal to the
accrual of savings, and savings are either hoarded or employed to
purchase the securities of already existing plant.
<P>
This has two immediate consequences: One is that the `paper
investment' of savings into old securities of existing plant merely results in 
distributing the profits from the existing plant to the holders of an
ever-increasing number of dollars worth of capital investments, which
also means that the returns per hundred dollars invested, or the interest rate,
must continuously decline. The other is that the money paid back to
the consumer is no longer equal to that withdrawn from circulation as
savings, which leads to a standing deficit in the consumer income available
for the purchase of the goods and services of industry. As technological
advancement and the resultant discrepancy between large and small
incomes increases, this situation can only get worse with time.
<P>
<H3>Stimulants to Distribution</H3>
<P>
Both of these factors, the slowing down of industrial expansion and
the slowing down of paper investment [into the securities of existing
industry with a consequent decline of the interest rate and increasing
deficit in consumer purchasing power] have been dominant influences
in the United States since the World War. Here let it again be
emphasized that these results are in nowise due to the War, but to long-time 
evolutionary trends, the World War being merely a convenient date
of reference.
<P>
In this manner we arrived at a stage of development wherein the
legitimate procedures of business, which in an earlier day were sufficient,
were no longer adequate to meet the necessary conditions for social
stability. Consequently extraordinary measures have had to be
instituted. One of these measures was the World War itself. Purchasing power
with which to buy the products of industry was provided by means of
government and foreign debts. Industry was boomed by the wartime
destruction of its products. During and after the war lavish credits
were extended abroad and consumer purchasing power at home was
bolstered through the debt creation mechanism of installment buying.
<P>
All of these measures were obviously temporary in that they could
not be kept up. They contained no provision for self-liquidation except
by repudiation, and indeed a day of reckoning did come in 1929. After
that time a new method of meeting the same discrepancy of purchasing
power had to be provided, and since business had already played its
cards, the government had to come to the rescue, and the deficit in
consumer purchasing power was in part made up through the
governmental creation of debt in the form of the unbalanced budget.
<P>
<H3>The New Deal</H3>
<P>
This, it may be remarked, is the sole secret of what little success
may be boasted by the New Deal. The purchasing power of the
small income public was not adequate to maintain consumption and
industrial operation at previous levels. By the mechanism of the
unbalanced budget this was in some measure made up through
the emergency and relief expenditures of the United States government.
Consumption increased; production followed. By the year 
1937 industrial production was again <VAR>n</VAR> approaching and in
some instances exceeding the previous all-time high in 1929. At this stage 
the spokesmen of business, still imbued with the doctrines of the
economists concerning the efficacy of 'confidence' and apparently
unaware that the government spending was the only important source
for making up the deficit in the business budget, set up a hue and
cry for the government to balance its budget. Promises to balance
the budget were made and the excess of government expenditures
over receipts was reduced from 4.8 billions of dollars in 1936 to 2.8
in 1937. The immediate consequence of this was the most drastic
curtailment of industrial production yet known. Between September, 
1937 and January, 1938--but 4 months--the volume of industrial
production dropped by an amount which in the 1929 'crash' required the
20 months from October, 1929 to July, 1931.  Yet the 1937 instance
has been euphemistically called a 'recession.'  Again, as in 1933, the
solution to this situation was found in the prompt injection of more
billions of dollars of government money into the purchasing power
of the small income public.
(Note: in the original version of this article, published in Technocracy A-8,
1936, it is stated: ``Since nothing has been done in the meantime by private industry
to 'provide for the deficit in small incomes, it follows that, should
the federal government discontinue its relief and emergency
expenditures whereby purchasing power is given to individuals,
industrial production will again shut down, but faster and tighter
than it has ever shut down before.'')
<P>
Since there is no mechanism whereby private business is able to
make up this deficit it still follows that the only thing that is keeping
business off the rocks is the continuation of government spending into
the indefinite future; or, what amounts to the same thing financially--war!
<P>
The whole virtue of government spending--as long as it can be kept
up--consists in the fact that money is being paid to the small income
public in excess of the amount simultaneously taken away in the
form of taxes. It is a simple matter to see that if the consumer income
is already inadequate to support industrial operation, the situation
is in nowise changed by governmental robbing of Peter to pay Paul
because Paul and Peter still have between them the same purchasing
power after as before. On the other hand, if Paul is paid some new
dollars especially created for the occasion without the robbing of
Peter, the total purchasing power of the two of them is increased by
the amount of the new debt created.
<P>
It has already been noted that while the previous methods of meeting
this deficit in consumer purchasing power have been varied--rapid
industrial expansion, world war, foreign credits, installment buying--
they all have this in common: That they were temporary expedients
and could not be maintained as a permanent policy. This is no less
true of the government unbalanced budget except that when this fails
it carries with it the collapse of the entire financial structure.
<P>
<H3>Fallacy of Price Reduction Argument</H3>
<P>
Of late there have been voluminous propaganda arguments to the
effect that the deficit in purchasing power has been offset by the
decline in the prices of manufactured articles, the decline in the price 
of automobiles from several thousand dollars to about $500 each being
a favorite exhibit. The irrelevance of this is obvious when it is
considered that the deficit in purchasing power results entirely from the 
fact that in order for industry to operate profitably and at the same
time to disburse any funds at all to large incomes, the amount paid
back to small incomes must be less than that taken from the consumer
originally. This is entirely independent of the price of the product.
but necessitates that the price, however small it may be, must always
be greater than the cost of production. Thus no matter how greatly
prices may be reduced, the money paid back to the small income
public by any industrial enterprise operating profitably is always
insufficient to enable the public to buy back its total output. The
same must therefore be true of all industry when lumped together.
<P>
Another specious argument often heard is that all businesses operate
at a loss and thereby represent a source of surplus purchasing 
power.  The fallacy here is that almost every one-armed roadstand
Constitutes a `business.'  Consequently, while the total number of
such business enterprises is large, the part played by them is
inconsequential as compared with the vast corporate enterprises such as
railroads, steel, oil, and the like. In fact, a prevailing interest rate
greater than zero is itself a statistical average of the profits and losses
of all business enterprises and indicates the excess of profits over
losses.
<P>
<H2>IV. A TECHNOLOGICAL DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM</H2>
<P>
<H3>Scientific Approach to the Problem</H3>
<P>
In the foregoing, our industrial growth and its Price System monetary
control have been considered in some detail because this is
one of the most misunderstood and misrepresented problems we
have to deal with at the present time; yet the phenomena here
discussed are fundamental with respect to all the major problems in
the operation of our social mechanism.
<P>
What we have seen is that our leaders of business and government
have gone from one blind expedient to another without the slightest
prospect of accomplishing anything more effective than a postponement
of the evil day when no expedient can be made to work any
longer. Yet, in spite of all efforts, one-third of the population of this,
the most richly endowed Continent on earth, have become virtually
pauperized, and the people of North America may consider themselves
fortunate indeed if they are not further induced by the same
business and political leadership to offer up a human sacrifice over a
trumped-up foreign war as an additional futile gesture.
<P>
A more eloquent example of demonstrated incompetence on the
part of social leaders is not to be found in all the annals of human
history!
<P>
What is there so difficult about the problem? What is it that has to
be done in order to solve it? Simply and solely that our Continental
totality shall be operated at a maximum of efficiency with a maximum
conservation of resources for the maximum production and distribution
of physical wealth--with a resultant standard of living greater
than has ever been obtained on the North American Continent.
<P>
To do this requires a social organization designed to operate all
production sequences and a distributive mechanism that will deliver
the products of industry to the consuming public at whatever rate is
required.
<P>
<H3>Getting Something for Nothing</H3>
<P>
In the distribution to the public of the products of industry, the
failure of the present system is the direct result of the faulty premise
upon which it is based. This is: that somehow a man is able by his
personal services to render to society the equivalent of what he
receives, from which it follows that the distribution to each shall be in
accordance with the services rendered and that those who do not work
must not eat. This is what our propagandists call `the impossibility
of getting something for nothing.'
<P>
Aside from the fact that only by means of the sophistries of lawyers
and economists can it be explained how, on this basis, those who do
nothing at all frequently receive the largest shares of the national
income, the simple fact is that it is impossible for any man to contribute to
the social system the physical equivalent of what it costs that system
to maintain him from birth till death-and the higher the physical
standard of living the greater is this discrepancy. This is because
man is an engine operating under the limitations of the same physical
laws as any other engine. The energy that it takes to operate him is
several times as much as any amount of work he can possibly perform.
If, in addition to his food, he receives also the products of modern
industry, this is due to the fact that material and energy resources
happen to be available and, as compared with any contribution he
can make, constitute a free gift from heaven.
<P>
Stated more specifically, it costs the social system on the North
American Continent the energy equivalent to nearly 10 tons of coal
per year to maintain one man at the average present standard of
living, and no contribution he can possibly make in terms of the energy 
conversion of his individual effort will ever repay the social system
the cost of his social maintenance. It is not to be wondered at,
therefore, that a distributive mechanism based upon so rank a fallacy
should fail to distribute; the marvel is that it has worked as well as
it has.
<P>
Since any human being, regardless of his personal contribution, is
a social dependent with respect to the energy resources upon which
society operates, and since every operation within a given society is
effected at the cost of a degradation of an available supply of energy,
this energy degradation, measured in appropriate physical units such
as kilowatt-hours, constitutes the common physical cost of all social
operations. Since also the energy-cost of maintaining a human being
exceeds by a large amount his ability to repay, we can abandon the
fiction that what one is to receive is in payment for what one has
done, and recognize that what we are really doing is utilizing the
bounty that nature has provided us. Under these circumstances we
recognize that we all are getting something for nothing, and the
simplest way of effecting distribution is on a basis of equality,
especially so when it is considered that production can be set equal
to the limit of our capacity to consume, commensurate with adequate
conservation of our physical resources.
<P>
<H3>Income in Units of Energy</H3>
<P>
On this basis our distribution then becomes foolproof and incredibly
simple. We keep our records of the physical costs of production in
terms of the amount of extraneous energy degraded. We set industrial
production arbitrarily at a rate equal to the saturation of the physical
capacity of our public to consume. We distribute purchasing power
in the form of energy certificates to the public, the amount issued to
each being equivalent to his pro rata share of the energy-cost of the
consumer goods and services to be produced during the balanced-load
period for which the certificates are issued. These certificates bear the
identification of the person to whom issued and are nonnegotiable.
They resemble a bank check in that they bear no face denomination,
this being entered at the time of spending. They are surrendered
upon the purchase of goods or services at any center of distribution
and are permanently cancelled, becoming entries in a uniform
accounting system. Being nonnegotiable, they cannot be lost, stolen,
gambled, or given away because they are invalid in the hands of any
person other than the one to whom issued.  If lost, like a bank
checkbook, new ones may be had for the asking. Neither can they be
saved because they become void at the termination of the two year
period for which they are issued.  They can only be spent.
<P>
Contrary to Price System rules, the purchasing power of an individual
is no longer based upon the fallacious premise that a man
is being paid in proportion to the so-called value' of his work (since
it is a physical fact that what he receives is greatly in excess of his
individual effort) but upon the equal pro rata division of the net
energy degraded in the production of consumer goods and services.
In this manner the income of an individual is in nowise dependent
upon the nature of his work, and we are then left free to reduce the
working hours of our population to as low a level as technological
advancement will allow, without in any manner jeopardizing the
national or individual income, and without the slightest unemployment
problem or poverty.
<P>
The period of work required of each individual, once the
reconstruction following the transition from the old system to the new is 
complete, need be no longer than about 4 hours per day, 164 days per
year, from the ages Of 25 to 45. The income of each individual,
however, will continue without interruption until death. Hence the
insecurity of old age is abolished and both saving and insurance
become unnecessary and impossible.
<P>
Such a mechanism of distribution simply renders all forms of trade
and commerce obsolete, and at the same time, because of the abolition
of money, makes them impossible. The entire social mechanism
then becomes one unit organization with as many branches as there
are industrial and social functions to perform. This organization, the
Technate, comprises all members of the population.
<P>
The area to be operated as a unit is the entire Continent of North
America.
<P>
<H3>Conclusion</H3>
<P>
At the outset it was proposed to investigate by the methods of science
the problem of technological unemployment and the related problem
--the breakdown of our traditional system of distribution. We have
made that investigation and we have found that machines do destroy
jobs. We have found that during American history up until the time
of the World War, while mechanization was destroying jobs, the
expansion of industry was such that the birthrate of new jobs exceeded
the death rate of old, but since the War, with industrial growth
leveling off, the death rate of old jobs has continuously exceeded the
birth rate of new.
<P>
Since, however, our present distributive mechanism is based upon
the payment for man-hours of service, at least for those who have
nothing else to exchange, it has been necessary for us to examine critically 
the fundamental Price System premises underlying our monetary
mechanism of trade and commerce. In this we have found that rules
which grew up to meet the needs of handicraft, individually owned,
small-scale industry are no longer adequate to effect the distribution
of the products of large-scale, mechanized industry, and that the
increasing instability of our present social organization is the direct 
consequence of the flat contradictions between the beliefs handed
down from- an ignorant past and the physical realities of the problem
we are obliged to face today.
<P>
The problem of coordinating and operating the biggest array of
industrial equipment on the face of the earth and distributing its
products to the population concerned is an entirely new kind of
problem that the human species has never had to face before. It is
unavoidably a technical problem-a problem whose solution will demand
the application of science to our social order, requiring the
coordination and participation of all citizens.
<P>
It was the recognition of the nature of this problem that led the
scientists of the Technical Alliance, the predecessor of Technocracy,
as early as 1919 to realize that the time was approaching when a new,
scientifically designed social mechanism would eventually become
imperative when the one we have now could no longer be made to work.
A very brief summary of the distributive system designed by
Technocracy Inc. has been given here. This system is based upon the
realities and exactitudes of scientific measurement and is consequently 
entirely subject to control so that it can be made at all times to do
precisely what is wanted of it.
<P>
The time of transition from the old, outmoded Price System with
its enforced scarcity, toil, and privation to the New America of
abundance and leisure is fast approaching.  Technocracy Inc. therefore
invites the cooperation of every functionally capable citizen of North
America to assist in the biggest designing and construction job in all
history.
