During the last five years the world has been flooded with two classes
of propaganda, one advanced by the capitalistic powers in an effort to
maintain the present, or rather to reclaim a previous status quo, and
on the other side, one even more intense advanced by radical parties
and labor unions in an effort to do away with the present system
altogether.  The first specie of propaganda necessitates no comment,
as the world is in a state of flux, and that which concerns itself
with maintaining what already is, is dealing with a dead carcass.  So,
that which is of primary importance, is that propaganda which is for
the purpose of burying the carcass of present systems, and
substituting a living mechanism.
<P>
<H3>WHO ARE ``THE WORKERS''
</H3>
<P>
There are many programmes of a supposedly radical nature running from
the Plum plan to communization. These are infinite in their
variations, but their variations are mostly as to how the change shall
come about. Their appeal is made to a rather indefinite character,
namely, ``the worker.'' Their appeal is made on the grounds of
robbery, corruption, and the unethical practices of the present
system. Their appeal is made for a change in control to place the
worker as the dominant factor and right these ethical wrongs. The
kernel of the more radical schemes is the expropriation of the present
owners of industry and property. Therefore, all this propaganda busies
itself with methods of intriguing the worker as an individual into
methods of expropriation and idealistic conceptions of a workers'
state.
<P>
``Workers of the world unite!''  has come to have as great a political
slogan value as ``Liberty, Equality, Fraternity!'' had during the
French revolution.  It is a fine phrase, but the question is ``Unite
for what?''  The unity so far achieved bears no relationship to
work. Not that the slogan should not be used; it has its value in an
advertising nation. Wilson's ``He kept us out of war'' gained for him
sufficient adherents to re-elect him, and to enable him to put us into
war. Slogans of the past have either been exhortations or expressions
of liberality with spiritual ideas, while slogans of more recent date
have gained power for their originators by their proclamation of great
material generosity. ``All power to the Soviets!'' and ``Land to the
peasants!'' undoubtedly are the greatest gifts that have ever been
made, but like all gifts they carry with them no obligation either in
use or abuse.  ``Labor creates all wealth.''  That human effort
produces all is only too obvious. ``To the worker belongs the product
of his toil.'' Once again the expression of an ethical right!
<P>
Who is ``the worker'' to whom all this propaganda is addressed? In
industry today, whether in a steel plant or a hospital (for we are
going to call all essential work industries, direct or indirect) the
divisions of functional service are four in number.  These are (1)
manual: consisting of unskilled and skilled labor, mechanic and expert
mechanic; (2) clerical: consisting of clerks, accountants, auditors,
who in the future should be industrial statisticians; (3) supervisory:
consisting of foremen, superintendents and managers, who in the future
should be functional supervisors, and not job bosses; and (4)
technical: consisting of draughtsmen, inspectors and technicians. This
is paralleled in a hospital by elevator operators, ambulance drivers,
record clerks, nurses and internes, superintendents, laboratory
workers, bacteriologists and consulting experts.  In an industrial
state the concept of ``the worker'' must include aH of these
divisions.  Treating the worker apart from his industrial function is
appealing to a political entity.  We all cease to be workers when we
are off the job. Today ``all those who work for wages'' is the
definition of ``worker''; whereas industrially it should be ``all
those essential to production.'' The advertising man and salesman work
for wages, but they perform no function in the producing or
distributing of any material. Any scheme proposed as a solution for
the present unrest which does not contain within its plan for the
operation of industry specifications for increasing the producing
power and eliminating all extraneous occupations is a political scheme
and doomed to but a brief existence. Any scheme which contemplates the
maintenance of present foreign trade is nothing short of political
imperialism under another name.
<P>
To the economist and theorist the abolition of capitalism is the
crucial point. Dealing only with financial wealth and its distribution
these people seek their remedy only by making distribution
equitable. But the very mechanism of material production and
distribution has been built by the capitalistic regime, and its waste
of materials and energy surpasses the sum total of its production so
that, no matter who comes into possession of the present industrial
system, the result will differ little from the operation of today.
<P>
Shylock says ``You take my life when you do take the means whereby I
live.'' Take from the capitalist his means, or in other words his
system, and the capitalist will undoubtedly be relieved of his life as
such.  But those who take over his means, or system, fall heir to the
same methods and inefficiencies, and inevitably to much the same life
as they had lived before.
<P>
NO CHANGE OR REVOLUTION HOWEVER GREAT FROM THE POLITICAL POINT OF VIEW
CAN FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE THE STANDARD OF LIVING UNLESS IT CARRIES WITH
IT A CHANGE IN THE BASIC TECHNIQUE.
<P>
<H3>THE SHORTCOMINGS OF THE GUILD SYSTEM</H3>
<P>
The guild system of the workers of Great Britain proposes that
industry shall be operated by a number of industrial guilds, each
guild to be composed of the trade unions engaged in one industry and
to be responsible for its product, the health of its workers, and the
maintenance of its material equipment. During operation the workers in
a guild are paid a national basic, or minimum wage. Their goods are
sold in the open market to individuals or other guilds. Cost and
maintenance are subtracted from the proceeds, and the surplus is
distributed pro rata among the workers in the guild.  Although the
guildsman call the guilds industrial, a perspective of one of them
shows that they are rather a heterogeneous collection of several
industries and associated trades. For instance they have garment, fur,
shoe and artificial flower factories in one guild called the clothing
guild. Another guild is comprised of what is known in Great Britain as
the engineering trades, including ship building, locomotive building,
machine building of all kinds and all repair machinists.  The
conception of a guildsman is of a guild parliament sitting in England,
wherein representatives of all free governing dominions of the British
Empire are represented, maintaining the present position of Great
Britain as the world's industrial middleman. Canada and Australia are
treated as subjective industrial entities, to be directed by the
industrial policies of the guilds of Great Britain. Of course India
and other colonies, not being self governing, would have no
representation. The producers would be represented by the industrial
guild to which they belong, the consumers by a political state
parliament which is the supreme national executive body. It will be
seen that while the guilds will appropriate the means of production
and distribution from their present owners, they are still
imperialistic in that they would attempt to maintain the political
organization of the British Empire, thereby retarding the industrial
development of other countries, and causing the exploitation of other
workers.  Within the guild itself, while admitting that employment
could be made more regular, and housing and sanitary conditions could
be much improved, the basis of production remains a capitalistic one
in that they are producing for sale in the open market, subject to
price fluctuation. Though the surplus profit returns to the workers,
the productivity varies so enormously in different industries that in
spite of a basic wage, incomes would vary tremendously, creating a new
capitalist class.  They would use the same monetary system and the
same banking system, the same internal fiscal policy of the state, in
that taxes would be levied on the guilds by parliament, and the guilds
would act as tax collectors to their individual members.  They can
employ their technicians and managers, etc. on any agreement which the
individual guild cares to make.  Any process or invention is submitted
to the guild and purchased by them if found desirable. Thus the guild
is not a complete complement of industrial workers and is not
obligated to accept any improvement.
<P>
The British textile guild would go on importing raw cotton and
manufacturing it into goods and in turn exporting it abroad.  The same
treatment would be accorded silk and wool. Today, Great Britain has 46
percent of the world's cotton producing spindles, whereas her
consuming capacity is less than 18 percent. She is entirely dependent
for the large percentage of her cotton upon United States. Great
Britain is some three thousand five hundred miles from our cotton
growing region, and the industrial question naturally arises ``Are the
other industrial countries going to continue to pay tribute to either
the British worker or the British capitalist to manufacture their
cotton goods for them?''
<P>
The production factors in the fabrication of raw cotton into finished
goods are relatively similar in United States and Great Britain. As
both the transportation of cotton and its manufacture are dependent
upon power, and as Great Britain is dependent upon coal as her source
of power, it is evident that, as power from coal costs three and
one-half times more in Great Britain than it does here, industrially
it costs more to produce cotton cloth in Great Britain than it does
here. This is not financial cost, but what the engineer calls
production cost. Let us see what the respective coal production costs
amount to in the two countries.
<P>
<H3>COAL AS A FACTOR IN PRODUCTION</H3>
<P>
In Great Britain there are 1,200,000 coal miners producing only 226
tons per man per year. In United States we have approximately 760,000
coal miners producing 794 tons per man per year. It is self-evident
that, barring a period of transition to a new order, Great Britain
cannot afford to support 1,200,000 men for mining coal for the purpose
of maintaining foreign trade.  Neither could any other country pay
their upkeep. The coal mines of both Great Britain and this country
are demanding attention. In both countries similar schemes have come
to light. Neither nationalization, coal guild, nor communization deal
with ton-hour production per man, nor do they take into consideration
the present methods of using coal, which utilizes only one-sixteenth
of its value. To technically utilize coal necessitates not only a
change in the methods of coal mining, but also affects all
transportation and present power plants. It would mean the creation of
new industries, and the elimination, wholly or in part, of old
ones. This is illustrated very aptly in the United States where 34
percent of the freight load of our railroads is coal. The elimination
of all coal transportation is not only scientifically possible, but
technically inevitable.  Here arises the prospect of a well-to-do
railroad guild and a prosperous coal guild being confronted with the
fact that the rest of industry will not tolerate a lowering of its
standard of living by maintaining a railroad guild one hundred percent
overmanned, and a coal guild five hundred percent overmanned.
<P>
<H3>FUNCTIONAL OWNERSHIP AS BAD AS PRIVATE PROPERTY</H3>
<P>
Today, the peasants of France are preventing France from entering a
new period of industrial progression. The peasants of Russia provide
for themselves, but do little more than that. These are examples of
groups of workers who persist in a method of production which,
although they prefer it, is nevertheless the result of that deadliest
of industrial diseases, stagnation.  The medieval guilds and the
pueblo communes all achieved craftsmanship, equitable distribution of
food, clothing and shelter, and equitable working participation, and
died because they persisted in holding the proprietary rights of
function inviolate. From time immemorial, when any group has achieved
craftsmanship and tolerable living conditions, the group has always
attempted, by enforcing numerous regulations, to prohibit any change
or improvement in the functional sequence to which they have become
accustomed in their trade. They have sought by all means in their
power to make functional ownership as great a vested interest as
entailed property. They have striven to pass their craft on from
father to son, even practicing this today in India and China, where
the same method is being taught to apprentices as was taught four
hundred years ago.  Private property is dangerous because it prohibits
complete utilization of material resources. Functional ownership is
even more dangerous in-as-much as it prohibits any improvement either
in the use of material resources or human effort.
<P>
Political history records that men are voted into positions, but it
does not record men ever voting themselves out of positions. Any group
of men which forms itself into a body to control the processes of an
industry does not vote in a new process whereby they would
automatically be voting the major part of the group out of that
industry. The coal miners of Great Britain, although they are
insisting upon nationalization, and although it is admitted that under
the present regime they cannot achieve any fundamental change in the
methods of coal mining and coal use, still are demanding something
which, under the present system or a future one, would amount to
nothing more than a slightly higher standard of living for themselves
as individuals. It is inconceivable that miners organized into a
militant body would democratically vote into existence another system
of coal mining and coal use whereby nine-tenths of their present
organization would have to be given employment in other industries.
<P>
<H3>THE LIMITATIONS OF LABOR'S VISION</H3>
<P>
Today, the world over, all programmes for a new order content
themselves with the advocating of a mere shift of control. All of them
preserve the present industrial entities.  All of them propose to
maintain the present lines of trade. The majority of labor
organizations are not capable of operating industry. There are a few
that are capable of operating it as well as the capitalist, but that
is not sufficient. There are none that can operate and coordinate the
present producing mechanism with the needed accompaniment of a change
of technique. A reply is often made to the statement of this
condition, to wit, ``The workers will acquire the knowledge and the
organization after they come into 'power'.'' In Russia, where 92
percent of the population are peasants, and where there is only a
young industrial development, a dislocation of industry, while serious
in itself, does not bring starvation to any large percentage of the
people. In United States, to attempt to acquire an operating knowledge
of an industry and an organization after the change would be preparing
for a birth while the autopsy was already being carried on. The
interdependence of industry with industry is such that the absence of
a producing organization capable of directing and operating industry
would bring about nothing short of chaos and dissolution. We have no
such organizations not even the proper nucleus of one, and yet the
propaganda for change goes on. The organizations of the present enlist
either those who profess a belief or the worker as an
individual. There exists no industrial organization wherein members
function in a similar capacity to that in which they work. This is
best illustrated by the man who, when asked at a meeting what group he
represented, said that he was a socialist, and from whom was finally
dragged the information that he was a stevedore, and represented the
stevedores as such. A Steinmetz may join any one of a number of labor
organizations as an individual, but there is no organization of
workers which he could join in his industrial capacity of research
technologist of the equipment division of the power industry.
<P>
The glass blowers, some years ago, possessed a very strong union and
were very highly paid. They attempted to maintain their union and the
old form of glass blowing in the face of a new industrial process. The
process won, and the process will always win eventually. Today, it
throws men out of jobs, but in the future every improved process will
raise the standard of living and increase mens' leisure.  Today, there
is not a single industry which cannot be revolutionized by processes
already proven. Technical science has traveled so far ahead of the
industrial order that, if only that which is already known were
applied, its effects would be farther reaching and more fundamental
than any political change could dream of accomplishing.
