<H1>The Mystery of Money</H1>
<!--AUTHOR--><H3>G. D. KOE, CHQ</H3>
<!--DATE--><h4>1938?</h4>
<P>
It seems very unkind that every person, who takes upon himself the
task of discussing the Price System and especially the role of money
in that system, should so disguise the meaning of the words he uses
and the phrases he employs that the ordinary reader has almost
insurmountable difficulty in ascertaining what the discussion is all
about.
<P>
This discussion, therefore, will deal in words, the meaning of which
will be clearly defined, and in phrases any person of ordinary
intelligence and education can easily understand.
<P>
<H3>Some Definitions</H3>
<P>
We will start with a few definitions of the terms to be used so that
there may be no misunderstanding about their meaning later on.
<P>
<em>What is a Price System?</em> A Price System is any social system whatsoever
that effects its distribution of goods and services by a system of
trade or commerce based on commodity valuation effected by means of
debt tokens, or money. The term Price System must not be confused with
such terms as profit system, or capitalist system. The factor of
ownership does not alter the mechanics of operating a Price System,
and it may be added in passing, that unless it be in some remote and
primitive community, none other than Price Systems exist at the
present time.
<P>
The term <var>exchange</var> includes buying, selling, trading, bartering,
exchanging, or transferring the property rights in any goods or
services at any given time or place.  Such transactions as are only
completed at a later date will be referred to as <var>delayed exchanges.</var>
<P>
<var>Value</var> is a difficult word to define. The meaning used herein is that
given in the <cite>Encyclopedia Brittanica</cite>, in which value is described as
`the measurement of the force of human desire.'  Value in any Price
System is the result of human desire impinging on the relative
abundance or scarcity of any article.
<P>
<var>Price</var> is a synonym for value and is merely another way of
describing it. Price is value in terms of money. Value as referring to
human labor or effort has no place in a Price System.
<P>
<var>Wealth</var> has two forms. <var>Monetary wealth</var>, which is
really aggregate
prices and is therefore another term still for value, and <var>physical
wealth</var>, which is the use of goods and services.
<P>
The phrase <var>goods and services</var> includes all commodities and forms of
work which may commonly be exchanged with other such forms.
<P>
The word <var>money</var> will be used to describe the medium of such
exchanges. Money may be in any form, but it is commonly represented by
a <var>certificate</var> or <var>token</var>.  This certificate or token may be of gold,
paper, nickel, silver, copper, iron, or any other commodity which the
particular community being examined may employ.
<P>
Money must never be confused with the commodity employed as the token
or certificate of money. A commodity may have a totally different
`value' as a commodity than it has as money.  Witness the different
`value' of a quarter and the `values' of silver and alloy of which it
is composed when it is melted down. Compare the `value' of a dollar
bill and the `value' of the paper it is printed on.
<P>
<H2>The Medium of Exchange</H2>
<P>
Money is principally used to enable delayed exchanges to be carried
out. When you sell your services to an employer, you would not expect
him to give you in return your board, room, clothes, amusements and
all the myriad little things you personally prefer. In order that the
delayed exchanges involved in providing all the manifold necessities
of life may be carried out with a minimum of delay, a medium for
simplifying these transactions is essential.  Since such delayed
exchanges are only deferred debts, the ideal medium in any Price
System is a <var>debt certificate</var> or <var>token</var>, that will
be freely accepted by
everybody in the community. This then is the money with which, you are
all familiar.
<P>
The use of money, then, is as a medium of exchange in the Price System
in which we live.  In order to avoid confusion, we will ignore the
business of dealing in money as a commodity until later and in the
meantime view it solely in its capacity as a medium of exchange.
<P>
<H3>Money is Not Real</H3>
<P>
Professor Soddy of Oxford University in England in his recent book <cite>The
Role of Money</cite> describes money in a neat epigram. He says, `Money is
the Nothing, you get for Something, before you can get Anything.'
Study this statement carefully and you will note that it accurately
describes the money you use.
<P>
Money is the `Nothing.' How can that be since money is a very real
thing to most people and everyone will claim that they can see and
touch it?  Because you can only see and touch the debt certificate
that represents money and not money itself.  You confuse the token
with that which the token represents. You never see or touch money
itself.  To understand this, read the wording of a dollar bill. The
words on a Canadian bill, `will pay to the bearer on demand,' mean `we
promise to pay to bearer on demand.' The words on a United States bill
are: `This certifies that there is on deposit in the Treasury of the
United States of America (x) dollars in silver payable to the bearer
on demand.' In short, it is a promise to pay; and that is what money
is-a promise. Any person who says he can touch or see a promise needs
a mental examination.  It just shows you how you can be fooled by
mistaking the token for what the token represents.
<P>
Max Planck is one of the world's greatest scientists. His dictum is
accepted by all genuine scientists as the basis of physical
science. It is as follows: `Only that which is measurable is real.'
By means of this we differentiate between the tangible and the
intangible, between the touchable and the untouchable, between the
real that is apparent to our physical senses and the unreal which is a
product of our imagination alone.
<P>
As you cannot measure a promise by physical means, you cannot measure
money. Money has reality only to the extent that you believe the
promise to pay will be respected. You can have in your possession
tokens issued by the Emperor Hadrian at Rome but it is money no longer
as the promissor is long dead and his promise worthless.  The German
Reichsmark and the confederate dollar were real money as long as the
promise to pay held good but today they are merely pretty pieces of
printed paper.
<P>
Perhaps you still do not understand that money is nothing and
unreal. Consider the gold, silver, copper or paper token that you call
money. It is not yours but the property of the issuer. To clip it,
melt it down, or destroy it is an offense, since it is only lent to you
for use in effecting transactions. If by chance it should be destroyed
and you can prove the complete destruction, the issuer is bound to
replace it. This is even true of a paper dollar bill. If you doubt
this statement, ask your bank manager. The tangible thing you handle
is only a token and nothing physical call destroy money. It is a
promise and a promise can only be destroyed by the imagination that
created that promise.
<P>
<H3>Creditors and Debtors</H3>
<P>
To obtain money, one must give up goods or services. Such goods and
services are real, tangible, and measurable things. They are the
`Somethings' you have to give in order to get the `Nothing' that is
money. You cannot normally obtain money, without giving up something
in exchange for it. This is not a hard and fast rule and the
exceptions will be taken up later.
<P>
Having obtained money, one becomes a creditor.  The issuer of money is
conversely a debtor. As Ruskin said: `For every creditor there is a
debtor.'  One cannot exist without the other. This truism should be
inscribed on the walls of our legislative chambers and our
schoolrooms. It is amazing that the exponents of the various theories
relating to social credit never appear to have beard of social debits.
<P>
The possessor of money is a creditor because he has given up goods or
services in order to obtain it.  The issuer of money is a debtor
because he has received goods and services and given nothing in
return. The debtor owes for these goods and services until such time
as the circle of delayed exchanges is completed and the transaction
closed. When this happens the money ceases to exist, for the debtor
has paid an equivalent of goods and services for those he has
received. The books are in balance and the system is in equilibrium.
<P>
In the case of currency money, this delayed exchange is never
completed and the circle remains open in perpetuity.
<P>
Buying, selling, investing, borrowing, or lending have no effect on
the quantity of money, since what one person gives up, another
gets. The only way in which the quantity of money is increased is by
issuing fresh money.
<P>
<H3>How Money is Issued</H3>
<P>
The issuing of more, new or fresh money is normally done when the
people in general are willing to dispense with goods and services in
order to have a greater supply of the medium of exchange.  The
possession of any money means that that individual is `out' certain
goods and services. When you obtain goods and services you give up
possession of the money and someone else goes without goods or
services in order to possess it. If no one gave up goods and services
in exchange for new money, the issuing of such money would be
equivalent to the `watering of stock.' Such action is called
inflation.
<P>
Legal tender or currency money is a perpetual debt owed to the public
by the governments and the issuing banks. This debt is non-interest
bearing and will never be repaid. It is owed to no individual as a
whole, but to the holders of that currency at any given time.
<P>
McLeod points out: `Currency money is a legal claim to wealth over
that which is in existence since in an individualistic society all
wealth has a positive and independent ownership.' Remember that he
speaks of monetary wealth alone. This is the style of writing that
makes the understanding of it so difficult to the ordinary man. One is
dealing not in realities but in legal abstractions. And legal
abstractions do not conform to physical laws. They can appear and
disappear in a miraculous way.
<P>
Legal tender money will remain a perpetual debt to the community
because the governments and the issuing banks that originally obtained
goods and services in return for these debt certificates have disposed
of these goods and services as if they were their own and not held in
trust for the holders of currency money.
<P>
Recently the Alberta government issued a fresh supply of currency,
miscalled Prosperity Bonds.  To enable them to do this, the unemployed
of Alberta were persuaded to give up certain services.  These services
were, however, considered valueless by the rest of the people of
Alberta, since they were themselves unwilling to give up money for
them.  The net result of this new issue of money was that it
automatically decreased the value of money in the Province of Alberta,
by expropriating a certain portion of the value of all other monies in
the province.  Fortunately for the people of the province the amount
involved was not great and the rise of commodity prices due to this
inflation was hardly noticeable.
<P>
Whether the government of the Province of Alberta had the legal right
to do this is beside the point. That they did this in order to `Prime
the pump of Purchasing Power' by means of public works is also beside
the point. All that is being considered is the factual evidence. In so
doing the Alberta government had but one way to maintain the value of
this money. They were forced to expropriate by taxation sufficient
goods and services, which were considered valuable by the people of
Alberta. A portion of this expropriation was done under the guise of
this inflated money by means of a turnover tax. Despite the efforts of
those officers of the government responsible for that so-called
experiment in a new form of money, it is now admitted that it was a
very costly method of learning what every person of average
intelligence could have ascertained by using the information available
to him.
<P>
<H2>Velocity Money</H2>
<P>
Silvio Gessel's Theory of Velocity Money is one of the many strange
money theories which have been put before the ordinary mail and which
bear such a curious resemblance to the writings of the astrologers and
the alchemists of the Middle Ages. Like them it requires the discovery
of the Philosopher's Stone, that whimsical dream of diseased
imaginations, to render all these strange abortions possible.
<P>
Like perpetual motion this idea of velocity money is founded on an
erroneous assumption. This assumption is that the exchange value of
money varies directly with the velocity of circulation. If the
Gesselian assumption were correct, money could fairly bear taxation if
such taxation increased its Velocity and therefore its value.
<P>
Let us analyze this assumption. The first question is, what is the
exchange-value of money? Remembering that money is nothing in itself,
but is merely the medium for facilitating delayed exchanges, one must
conclude that its only value lies in what was given up for it. If this
is true, then the inflated or printing press money, for which nothing
was given tip, will tend rapidly to become valueless despite its
velocity of circulation. This is borne out by the factual evidence of
the Reichsmark and the confederate money.
<P>
<H3>The Value of Money</H3>
<P>
The value of money, then, depends on how much the people want the
medium of exchange in preference to physical wealth. The total value
of money will depend on how much physical wealth the community is
willing to do without.
<P>
Money is not what you can get for it, but how much you have to go
without in order to possess it. You do not buy goods to get
financially rich, you sell them. True, if you are not the original
producer you will have to buy first, but then you must remember the
Price System adage: `Buy cheap and sell dear.' If you do not do so,
you will reach the relief lines very quickly. To possess money you
must sell and <var>go without</var> goods. You cannot spend and have
your money at the same time.
<P>
Remember that when you possess money, you are `out' some goods and
services. If the value of money depended on velocity, this would not
be true, since you would be `out' more or less goods and services
depending on the relative velocity of the money. Thus if the velocity
was only great enough you would be `out' no goods or services at
all. In connection with this it is well to note that the Reichsmark
had a terrific velocity at a time when it was comparatively valueless.
<P>
The value of money is fixed by human desire impacting on the relative
scarcity or abundance of money. This is the reason why the value of
money is a variable more elastic than rubber and as inconsistent and
uncertain as an Albertan winter.
<P>
If the value of money is fixed by human desire, then it must follow
that the quantity of money must vary inversely with it. If a greater
quantity of money were issued than the people desire, then the value
of money would automatically decline.  In every-day language, prices
would rise. Goods and services would be worth more in terms of
money. This is inflation. And every known case of inflation bears out
that the exchange-value of money is fixed by human desire impinging on
the relative abundance of money.
<P>
If the value of money were geared to velocity then inflation would
have no effect on the value, provided the velocity were sufficiently
increased. In Germany, during the period of inflation, the speed of
transactions was enormous, but despite this the value of the
Reichsmark fell, till it vanished out of sight.
<P>
If the value of money depends on human desire, and if the quantity of
money is reduced, money becomes more valuable and prices fall. This is
deflation. In Canada, during the deflation practised from 1930 to
1934, this fact was too notorious to be ignored. This again
demonstrates the fallacy of the velocity theory of money.
<P>
Any other of the money theories may be tested the same way and the
yardstick of definitions applied to them, when they will be found to
necessitate either a new definition that does not meet the measurable
facts of the cases available or will fail to meet the definitions
given above. This habit of failing to exactly define the meaning of
the words used results in many quaint fallacies.
<P>
The human race is especially adept at believing what has an apparent
integrity. Any group of individuals who can encourage a belief in
witchcraft, or admit that it is possible that geese came from
barnacles, or still fall for ghost stories, or Cadborosaurus and the
Okanagan monster, Ogopogo, may well be credulous enough to accept any
monetary theory.
<P>
The velocity of money only affects its value in the minds of mystics
and magicians. It has no more bearing on either the quantity or value
of money than the velocity of your motor car has on the quantity or
the value of the wheels it runs on.
<P>
Velocity has a certain relation to value, since if the quantity is
fixed and the volume of trade is enlarged, the velocity of money will
be increased proportionately as the time interval of transactions is
shortened. During this process, however, the value and the quantity of
money need not alter one iota.
<P>
It is admitted that if you increase the quantity of money, either the
volume of trade must increase or the velocity of money will
decrease. Vice versa, if you decrease the quantity of money, the
volume of trade must decrease or the velocity of money will
increase. Nevertheless, the changing of the value or the quantity of
money need have no effect on the velocity, provided the volume of
trade changes relatively to the change in quantity.
<P>
In short, the Gesselian theory of money bears a strong family
resemblance to those learned medieval discussions as to how many
angels could dance on the point of a needle. It is a sad example of
how futile a learned argument can be when the basic facts are not
known.
<P>
<H3>Helping The Chiselers</H3>
<P>
The major result obtainable by increasing the velocity of money by
governmental decree would be a vast waste in human energy, with
correspondingly more work for doctors, hospitals, and asylums, a few
bankruptcies and a fresh crop of relief recipients.
<P>
This would be unpleasant enough, but the method of increasing the
velocity makes this situation, bad as it is, even worse. To handle
this velocity money, one should be an accomplished chiseler. Let the
other fellow get caught but do not be the sucker yourself. If you fail
to unload you will be the fall guy. No wonder the men who propagated
this trickery on the Albertans declined to take any part of their
salaries in this velocity money. Prosperity bonds being velocity money
require a degree of deception, chicanery, and the usual melange of
crooked deals, which in small-minded circles pass as smartness.
<P>
<H3>Taxing the Suckers</H3>
<P>
It is amazing to any student of psychology to bear the exponents of
this velocity money assert that the tax will force people to part with
it. It would appear they cannot appreciate that while for every
creditor there is a debtor, there are also two people involved in
every exchange, a buyer and a seller. The buyer may be actuated by the
desire to get rid of this velocity money but the same desire must act
retroactively on the seller causing him to resist. The net result is
dynamic equilibrium.  The merchants of Alberta learned the force of
this truism as they found it ever more increasingly difficult to
return this velocity money into circulation.
<P>
If the Gesselian-type money had circulated two years as was originally
intended, the sucker class would have been the goats. This two year
idea was apparently the result of the reading of some Technocratic
literature by the proponents of the scheme and exemplifies the awful
result of a little undigested knowledge.
<P>
Some of the tax that went to pay for the redemption of this funny
money came out of the pockets of the already half starved unemployed.
The majority came from the none too ample incomes of the wage and
salary earner. The very, very small balance came from the pocket-books
of the well-to-do.
<P>
Why should this be so? Because the very fact that the well-to-do have
amassed monetary wealth is proof that they are well versed in the
gentle art of making the other fellow do the paying. That is how you
get rich under a Price System. To win under the rules of the game of
the Price System.  you must be able to make a profit, and profits
cannot be made if you are sucker enough to pay all, or for that
matter, any of the taxes which cunning, but singularly dumb
politicians try to unload on you. Ask any corporation lawyer and he
will tell you that that is where his bread and butter lies.
<P>
The consumer is the only man in this or any other country that ever
paid a tax or ever will under any form of Price System. The average
man, taken by and large, consumes approximately the same amount,
provided his income is not below the subsistence level. His wife and
children do likewise. So, you, the innocent and gullible consumer,
will pay and pay and pay.
<P>
Do you realize that the Price System cannot operate except in a real
or enforced scarcity? Do you know that the political racket, under
whatever name it operates, is an interference control designed to keep
you in bondage to a Price System? Do you appreciate that you cannot
loan, beg, borrow, buy, produce, or steal your way out of any Price
System?
<P>
Why not give up repeating parrot fashion, the shibboleths, which you
use under the erroneous impression that you are thinking. Why not
clear from your attics the mental rubbish your `superiors' and
`betters' have put into them. If you do, you will soon proceed to
<var>measure,</var> so that you will know and ascertain the realities. Then you
will find how easily the showmen and grifters of the Price System have
been fooling you. The full significance of Barnum's words will strike
you: `There is one born every minute.'
<P>
In the meantime you will find that statistical evidence proves
conclusively that if any person or persons assert that they can raise
the standard of living on this Continent to one or more times the
standard of living in 1929, and still stay within the bounds of the
Price System, they are either grossly ignorant of our social mechanism
or they are willfully misleading you for their own ends.
<P>
<H2>The Game Of The Price System</H2>
<P>
The Price System is a game and is played according to certain clear
and well defined rules. One of the strictest of these rules is that no
player must `welsh.' In common parlance you must pay your debts and
obligations however they may have been incurred. Your promise must be
kept as good as your bond.
<P>
If you `welsh' on your debts, the professional gamblers (and in the
Price System we are all professional gamblers) cannot afford to deal
with you.  In the game of the Price System, as in all other gambling
games, there are `losers' and `winners.' In the Price System game,
those who have lost their stakes are spoken of as being on relief.
<P>
As in any gambling game, there are a number of persons, who cannot at
the moment pay for their chips, so in the Price System game there are
individuals, who are in the same position. In both cases such
individuals give I.O.U.s to cover their indebtedness, and as any of
you that indulge in gambling games know, the game stops when the
losers can no longer redeem their I.O.U.s either out of winnings or
out of their savings.
<P>
This is as true of the Price System game as of any other game. The
game may be prolonged by the payment of interest but this is only
possible for a short time and when the interest cannot be paid, the
game must be declared closed. The great game of the Price System
played on the North American tables is drawing steadily closer to that
sticky and unpleasant finish.
<P>
<H3>Two Kinds of Money</H3>
<P>
Up to now, we have been looking mainly at currency money. There are,
however, two kinds of money--<var>currency money</var> and
<var>private credit money.</var>
Most delayed exchanges today are made with the latter form while the
former, which has been explained already, is used as `chicken feed'
for the minor transactions of the individual consumer.
<P>
Private credit money is money issued by the individual. Not, as is so
often erroneously supposed, by the banker. The banker only issues
currency money, though he may issue a small amount of private credit
money as a `corporate' individual. A `corporate' individual is another
legal abstraction which your lawyer can explain to you. The banker is
far too wise to attempt to issue any other money than currency
money. He prefers to sell you his services as a book-keeper and
pawnbroker.
<P>
Private credit money is issued principally in the form of sight drafts
called cheques or checks. In commercial circles these may take the
form of time or date drafts and other varied shapes.
<P>
The issuance of private credit money came about as the result of the
growth of the cotton trade between America and England. It was
inaugurated by the Philadelphia Quakers and taken up by their
associates in England. This occurred owing to the refusal of the Bank
of England to issue enough currency money to enable the Quakers to
handle satisfactorily the enormous volume of trade they were
developing between Philadelphia and Lancashire.
<P>
When started it was fiercely opposed by the issuers of currency
money. They had a monopoly and were not disposed to lightly let it
go. They did not realize that they themselves forced it into existence
by attempting to maintain a forced scarcity of money. The Quakers won
the contest, and the right to issue private credit money was granted
to everyone.
<P>
The private banker was not responsible for this.  It was a struggle
between the merchants and the currency money monopolists, the Bank of
England and the Rothschilds who controlled it. The private banker
merely helped to establish the custom of dealing in this private
credit money. He had to, or he would have gone out of business. All he
did was to sell his services as a public accountant and
bookkeeper. This custom of issuing one's own private credit money
through a bank has become such a fixation today that few people if any
realize that they can draw a check on themselves just as easily as
they can draw a check on a bank and that it is just as legal and
valid. It is curious how quickly customs and habits become ingrained.
<P>
This private credit money is usually issued against bankers' I.O.U.s
or backed credits. It is a common fallacy to say: `I have money in the
bank.'  You have no money in the bank nor has anyone else except the
banker. When you make a deposit, you sell your currency or private
credit money to the banker, who in return gives you his I.O.U.  by
making an entry in your pass-book.
<P>
As an inducement to do this, the banker guarantees to keep your
account and promises to redeem your private credit money with currency
as and when it is required. The banker would rather purchase such
private credit money of yours with an I.O.U. than give currency for it
but he will keep his bargain. If you doubt this, ask your bank
manager.
<P>
`Backed credit' is the result of a separate transaction. In this case
you have nothing to deposit or sell to the banker for his I.O.U. The
banker, being a pawnbroker as well as a public accountant, arranges to
take a lien or a chattel mortgage on your goods and in return places
at your disposal certain amounts in the form of I.O.U.s. If you fail
to make good what you have borrowed, he can then reimburse himself and
if he has judged correctly the saleable value of your goods and
chattels, he will not be the loser. In this he generally errs on the
side of caution.
<P>
<H3>Creating New Money</H3>
<P>
When you issue your private credit money it becomes a forced charge on
the community, by increasing the quantity of money. As a general rule,
the community is willing to accept this, and they will signify their
acceptance by giving you goods and services in return for your
check. When the delayed exchanges in which you are interested have
been completed, you will have to give up goods and services, or such
bankers' I.O.U.s as you have been able to obtain with your profits,
and your private credit money will be canceled. It then ceases to
exist. This is why the quantity of money is in a constant state of
fluctuation. The columns of your daily paper regarding bank clearances
will give you statistical evidence of this.
<P>
If you issue private credit money without such `backing' or without
bankers' I.O.U.s, that is if you issue an `N.S.F.' or `No Account'
check, you are issuing money just the same. In this case you must
either take it up on presentation with goods or services, or with
currency money. If you fail to do so, you will find yourself in danger
of being jailed for having obtained goods, or services by false
pretenses. Your crime will be having `welshed' on your contract with
the people in general, which is why that is regarded as a criminal
offense.
<P>
<H3>Savings</H3>
<P>
Money is rarely hoarded. There are only a few ignorant folk who hide
their money in mattresses or under the floor. Most people pass it on
to someone else at once, that is, by spending it; or if they have more
than they need for consumption, they try to thrust the onus of
spending it on someone else, by, investing it.
<P>
Saving is a custom resultant of the ever prevalent scarcity in any
Price System. One must save, for every individual is dependent on his
earning capacity -- that is, on the opportunity to exchange his goods
and services with others-to obtain other goods and services of which
the individual may be in need.  Without such savings the ordinary
person could not tide himself over periods when his earnings were
insufficient or during sickness or old age.
<P>
Such savings must be in the form of money, since one cannot store
goods or services for indefinite periods because of natural decay. But
money stored away in a hole in the ground would soon cause a shortage
of itself, if the practice became universal.  This would force an ever
increasing issuance of fresh money and would disrupt any Price System.
<P>
For this reason such savings must be returned into the Price System to
carry out their proper function of facilitating delayed exchanges. To
induce people to do this is the function of interest.  That interest
may develop into usury does not affect this. Some premium must be
given to the individual to induce him to turn over his savings to
strangers for use as money.
<P>
The greater the interest rate, the lower may be the security for the
return of the principal. But cancel all interest, and savings will go
back under the floor, and the whole glittering edifice of the Price
System will crash in ruins about you. If you live in a Price System,
interest is essential to it. As interest rates approach zero, the
Price System you operate will come to an end.
<P>
<H3>Interest</H3>
<P>
Interest is the wages of money. High interest means that money is of
value and therefore scarce.  Low interest rates mean that money is
abundant.  The present low rates should be assurance to those who
complain that we have an insufficient supply of the medium of
exchange. They would be correct only if interest rates were as high as
they are in the villages of India--somewhere between thirty to fifty
percent, instead of being down to three or three and a half percent.
<P>
The excessive liquidity of the banks as evidenced in every bank report
in Canada over the last two years should be a clear indication that
money is abundant. It is hardly the fault of the banker that the
supply of competent debtors is so small. That is a factor that neither
the banker nor the politicians have yet devised a way of
controlling. If any Price-System-minded person can invent a way of
producing competent debtors so that the banks can lend them money, he
will have earned the undying gratitude of big financiers and will have
solved a problem more abstruse than ever was the search for the
Philosopher's Stone or perpetual motion.
<P>
You will remember that money is the medium of exchange; that the
tangible form of such a medium is usually a debt certificate or
token. You will note that bankers are dealers in such debt
certificates and are book-keepers to the public, and that they carry
on a sideline business as pawn-brokers or money-lenders. You will not
forget that bankers are issuers of currency money, and are not as a
general rule issuers of private credit money.  Yet you will have
remarked that the banker has come in for a great deal of opprobrium
both from certain types of politicians, the left wing radicals, and
the man-in-the-street. Such a strong dislike must have a cause even if
the individual places the blame on the individual and not on the
system.  The banker has been guilty of using his reputation to issue
inflated money, but then, so has the politician, while many people
have been guilty of issuing `rubber' checks.
<P>
The banking system, however, has been guilty of a more venal offense
than this. It, in conjunction with politics has been guilty of
defrauding the public by means of the gold standard. By this means the
big financiers and their associates have been able to depreciate the
standard and then force it back again, thus depriving the holder of
money of some of its value.
<P>
The depreciation has never been very large but the amount of money in
circulation was so tremendous that the profit was immense. This
practice, which is quite as ethical as deliberately altering weights
and measures, was regarded until lately as the height of business
acumen.
<P>
`Never give the sucker an even break' has always been considered a
sound rule of gambling dens, but even the habitues of the toughest
joint would revolt at such a raw deal as the manipulation of the gold
standard had become. The details of how this was done are too
complicated for a short discussion of this nature but the fortunes
amassed by international bankers are prima-facie evidence of the
results to be obtained by such a process. This may well be described
as the banker's crime, and should give him a good start for the title
of the world's meanest man.
<P>
<H3>Certificates of Property</H3>
<P>
<var>Certificates of debt</var> must not be confused with <var>certificates of
Property.</var> That is why banks have as stooges, trust companies and
investment houses.  These deal in certificates of property such as
bonds, stocks, mortgages, land titles, and numerous other instruments
that are expressed in terms of money but are not negotiable except by
transfer and cannot properly be considered under the heading of money
as a medium of exchange.
<P>
It was early recognized, however, that certificates of debt readily
lent themselves to being bought and sold as commodities. This dealing
in money as a commodity is only a side-line and has no appreciable
effect on the quantity or value of money, since it is solely a matter
of gambling on the relative rise or fall in money values. The Money
Exchange, like the Stock, Mining, and Wheat Exchange, is merely a
legalized and large scale poker game.
<P>
`Bet-you-a-million' Gates, Bill Durant, and the others of like kidney
are dignified by the name of I operators' and figure in the front
pages and society columns of the papers. John Doe and Richard Roe who
never bet more than a five spot, figure in the police court news and
are regarded as petty criminals. Which goes to prove that a rose by
another name would smell quite different if roses were also legal
abstractions.
<P>
<H3>Social Dividends</H3>
<P>
Professor Soddy states that any government by issuing new money can
declare a national dividend.  This would seem to support the social
credit theory.  Far be it from this discussion to dispute the
statement but it seems to be as true as saying that if one has a drink
of scotch one will feel exhilarated.  And it is equally true that if
one goes on and drinks a bottle or more of whisky one will eventually
get drunk and become in-incapable.
<P>
Major Douglas, the amateur financier and follower of Marx, amplifies
the Marxian theories of unearned increment to arrive at his idea of a
large and permanent dividend. Unfortunately Douglas has never followed
out the ramifications of his own theory. His evidence before the New
Zealand and the Albertan legislatures, as well as his writings on the
subject, show this clearly. The direct effect of his control over the
Albertan cabinet recently has shown that he has no conception of the
problem and that his theory is very similar to the ideas of all other
inflationists.
<P>
Professor Soddy points out that such a dividend might be as high as
$8.00 or $10.00 per head for the first year of issue. He points out,
however, that to state that such a dividend could be increased so as
to be worth while without a corresponding rise in prices, or could be
issued, supported by legal enactments to prevent such a rise in
prices, is mere demagogic absurdity. Any such enactments would have an
effect similar to that of the prohibition laws in the United States.
<P>
Why is such a promise of national dividends an academic absurdity?
Because all such dividends must be gifts not loans. All such gifts are
claims against the community. They become monetary wealth, and such
claims cannot be destroyed without taxation or expropriation.
<P>
If this dividend is used as a medium of exchange, it becomes money,
regardless of what name is given to it. If it is money it is a claim
on the general physical wealth of the community, and goods or services
must be given up for it or the value of money will drop.
<P>
To complete the circle of exchange, the individual receiving the gift
must give up equivalent goods or services.If he cannot, then someone
else in the community must give them up for him. Money, whether one
calls it prosperity bonds, social dividends or social credit is still
the `Nothing' for which you must first give up `Something' before you
get `Anything.' A different name does not change the breed of the
animal, and a skunk remains a skunk and smells just as bad even if you
call it a pussy-cat.
<P>
Here we come back to an earlier statement. We pointed out that you
must give up something to get money but that it was not a hard and
fast rule.  There are two ways of evading it-one by inflation, the
other by gift, expropriation, or just plain highway robbery. The first
can be used to get crosses on a ballot paper because the ordinary
man-in-the-street will fall for it easily, but eventually it will
produce the same result as the other-crosses on graves instead of on
ballot papers. This, of course, is done by governments and on a large
scale. In the case of individuals and in small quantities, the gift
idea has been worked quite well. Al Capone can explain the best
methods of carrying this out on a fairly large scale.
<P>
All this fol-de-rol about `dividends' such as some of our politicians
are handing us is but another Price System panacea. It ranks with the
wild-cat schemes of Huey Long, Townsend, Father Coughlan and $30 Every
Thursday. It is merely another patent for lifting ourselves by our own
bootstraps or for solving the age-old problems of the Philosopher's
Stone and perpetual motion.
<P>
The suckers of this Continental area have almost reached the limits of
taxation and cannot stand much more. The debt structure has also come
close to its limit of growth and even such a mouth-piece of the debt
barons of Wall Street and St. James Street as Roger Babson, is
beginning to admit that it cannot continue.
<P>
Continual and perennial growth of the debt structure is, however,
essential to the maintenance of the Price System. When it ceases to
grow, that is, when interest approaches zero rates, and technological
unemployment destroys with ever increasing rapidity the flow of wages
and salaries upon which the whole Price System structure depends, it
must of all. This is a dynamic world and nothing in it remains static.
<P>
Scientific research, working with mathematical accuracy, has shown
that the limits of tolerance beyond which the Price System on this
Continent can no longer be maintained will be reached around 1942. At
some point in this period, the creaking machinery of the Price System
will stop moving and nothing you nor any other man will do, will set
it in motion again.
<P>
It will pass as the various geologic eras have passed. It will never
happen again. The history of the Price System is a history of
scarcity. The introduction of the means of using vast quantities of
extraneous energy on the North American Continent has introduced an
era of abundance. Mankind here must either adapt itself to these new
conditions or make way for a new race that can.
<P>
<H3>Mene, Mene, Tekel, Upharsin</H3>
<P>
Science has written these words across the walls of the Price
System. That System has been weighed in the balance and found
wanting. Value is an intangible, and its weight can change without any
physical reason. As exchange-value is the basis of all Price Systems,
the whole structure is metrically unsound. Neither value, price, nor
money, may be measured physically; and so science has relegated all
three to their proper place along with the wails of the banshee,
ghosts, astrology, and all the other trappings and paraphernalia of
necromacy.
<P>
There is only one science and it is founded on human observation by
means of the physical senses.  Science sets up arbitrary systems of
measurement and these systems cannot and do not change. Science cannot
deal with such will-o'-the-wisps as values and price.
<P>
<H2>Distribution, Not Exchange</H2>
<P>
The need of or a metrical system by which goods and services could be
measured so that they could be distributed to the people was met by
the promulgation of Howard Scott's `Theory of Energy Determinants.' At
first, like all other scientific theories from Newton's Laws of
Gravitation to Max Planck's Quantum Theory, it was untried and
uncertain. Set to the task of measuring physical production and
consumption, seventeen years ago, it has proved itself no longer a
theory but an accurate and certain mathematical process by which the
trends and results of Price System operations can be studied and
predicted. It is also a definite and unchangeable (even if arbitrary)
system by which all goods and services can be accurately measured.
<P>
Every schoolboy knows that to add and subtract fractions it is
necessary to reduce them to a common factor. Every school boy knows
that you cannot add heterogeneous things such as coal, flour, iron and
oil together, and produce anything but a mixture. Yet the wise men who
head our economic schools do this every day in their articles,
statistics, and learned treatises. They have the pious conviction that
money is a common factor to all these things and if one reduces them
to terms of money, one should be able to add, multiply, subtract, and
divide them.
<P>
Lately, schools of economics have arisen which have further complicated
this process by adding so- called weighting statistics. Apparently for
the same reason that the medicine man added snakes' skins and a
rabbit's foot to his mumbo-jumbo. The net result has been a system of
economics as scientific as astrology, palmistry, or tea-cup reading.
<P>
<H3>Energy--The Common Factor</H3>
<P>
When Howard Scott showed the economists that all such articles as
coal, flour, iron and oil had a common factor in energy and that this
common factor enabled them to be reduced to its terms and added,
multiplied, subtracted, and divided freely and mathematically, they
resented being shown their errors. This is not a new habit, for their
forefathers threatened to burn Galileo for similar reasons. To expose
the quackery of the all-powerful medicine-men is always dangerous.
<P>
Every embryonic student of physics knows that work is a word used to
describe the effects of a force acting on a mass so as to cause it to
move.  He knows that this work can be, and is, measured accurately by
certain arbitrary standards called ergs, joules, and foot-pounds. He
knows further that coal, iron, flour, and oil, or for that matter, any
other definite good or service, taken from the earth, processed and
distributed by any individual must be accompanied by the application
of work. Since such work done in so delivering any article of goods or
in performing any service can be accurately and precisely measured be
knows that such measurements are real. Do not confuse the word work
with human labor.
<P>
As every type of goods and services can be so measured, it would seem
emblematical of the larger lunacy to persist in pretending that it is
better to measure such goods and services in such unmeasurable terms
as values, price or money.
<P>
<H3>Machines Necessitate Accuracy</H3>
<P>
Man has long ceased to use such measurements as the span of the hand,
as far as the eve can reach, a pace, a bowst-iot or even a gunshot,
for lineal distances. He no longer uses knots on a line to measure
speed though he keeps the word. Still he retains the primitive method
of measuring goods and services by <var>values</var> just as they were measured
when a distance was spoken of as a day's journey.  In order to control
the gigantic energy consuming devices of our North American
civilization man must change his outworn habits.
<P>
There may still be carpenters who measure off a length by pacing it;
there may still be farmers who put their wheat in a basket called a
bushel; one can find a primitive individual who will judge the
strength and speed of the wind by the eye; but if a construction
engineer on a skyscraper job were to use the methods of that
carpenter; if an elevator man were to purchase wheat by the bushel
basket; if an airman were to judge his wind speeds by appearances; how
long would our high-energy civilization run!  Old-fashioned methods
may suit a few conservatives, but we can be sure of but one thing and
that is change, and the change has been towards greater and greater
accuracy of measurement.
<P>
The amount of work done on the basic matter comprising any goods or
services from the time the basic matter is unearthed, through the
various processes necessary to convert that matter to use forms and to
distribute the final product to the point of consumption will comprise
the energy cost of the goods or services. Such energy costs are fixed
except where the improved use of mechanical devices will from time to
time lower them. Such energy costs can be accurately measured and
cannot be manipulated.
<P>
<H3>Abundance Is Here</H3>
<P>
This North American Continent is the one great continental area where
scarcity conditions no longer prevail. Asia, Africa, Australia, and
even Europe are areas of scarcity. North America has reached the stage
of abundance, despite the frenzied efforts of the politicians and
financiers to disguise, restrict, and curtail it. No matter whether
drought, grasshoppers, floods, storms, and other natural causes are
supplemented by crop destruction, curtailment of acreage, the killing
of stock or the paying of `danegelt' to the producer, the inevitable
result will be the same.
<P>
Abundance has come to the North American Continent and the only
question at issue is whether we will take advantage of the bounty of
nature, or whether we prefcr to sit dumbly by and be smothered by the
good things of life, resisting them because they are `tabu.'
<P>
Since the year 1930, the quantity of extraneous energy, that is energy
outside of man's muscles, used on this North American Continent has
been greater than all the extraneous energy used by all the peoples of
the world since the dawn of man down to the year 1930. Is this fact
not evidence of changes greater than have occurred in the world
before? Is this fact alone not proof that our methods of distribution
must be changed?
<P>
<H3>Exchange Is Archaic</H3>
<P>
Just as the Egyptian fellaheen clings to his traditional habit of
raising water from the Nile with a sweep to which is attached a
bucket, ignoring the possibilities of such structures as the Assuan
Dam or the Delta Barrage, so do we also cling f utilely to the
primitive custom of trade. just as the peasant cultivator is being
forced into greater and greater poverty by the big irrigation projects
of the Upper Nile, so are we being forced into greater and greater
poverty by the steady advance of extraneous energy devices.
<P>
The Price System necessitates that each shall have something to
exchange. Throughout the past centuries this product has been human
labor. Well might Marx say that all goods were made by human labor
since human labor was the basis of the Price System in which he
lived. In the sweat of their brows men made goods and performed
services for which they received in renumeration a medium of exchange
so that they might obtain the necessities of life.
<P>
Scarcity was the keynote-scarcity of human labor so that every man
might be employed to the full extent of the daylight hours; scarcity
of labor so that the fellaheen, endlessly lifting buckets of water
from the river to irrigate his scanty crop might at least earn
sufficient medium of exchange to eat; scarcity of product so that man
labored to produce sufficient to enable him to consume enough energy
so that he might labor for another day. The machine was yet crude and
though, even in the days of Marx, it was causing distress by
displacing human beings from manual labor, it had not yet destroyed
their livelihood. Human labor was as yet the main source of all goods
and services.
<P>
The destroyer of trade unions is not the employer but such men as
Benjamin Franklin, Faraday, and the electrical wizard, Steinmetz. They
displaced brawn by brains. They lengthened the daylight hours till the
whole twenty-four are as one. They destroyed the source of income
which had fed the Price System and opened the way for the metallurgist
and the chemist, the technician and the scientist to destroy the
scarcity and to take from mankind the necessity of earning their daily
bread by the sweat of their brows. But in so doing they destroyed also
the sole source of exchange among the great majority of men on this
Continent. Man can no longer sell his muscle power here in the open
markets.
<P>
Today on this North American Continent the machine is triumphant.  The
long lines of relief recipients that gather at the city relief
offices, even in primitive agricultural communities, prove this. The
railway brotherhoods may pass resolutions, but the streamlined train
is here to stay. The old time stocker and harvester may complain, but
his job is going.
<P>
The farmer may have been the backbone of the community but that
backbone is passing as the notochord passed. We may still use human
labor to build our roads but the machine is moving in. The coal miner
is passing out of the picture, the steel worker is going with him; and
the textile worker is fading like the glassblower into the limbo of
forgotten men.
<P>
<H3>The Passing Of The Wage Slave</H3>
<P>
The machine is here to stay. It is emancipating the wage slaves who in
ever increasing numbers are becoming like the lilies of the field:
they toil not, neither do they spin. The machine does not strike nor
talk back and it requires no relief when unemployed. If you wish to
continue your Price System you will have to breed a new race of men,
men that can lie fallow for a season, or can be stored away in
warehouses till they are required.
<P>
Human labor means wages. Wages means purchasing power. Purchasing
power means profits and profits means savings. Savings mean more and
more means of production. And so round and round the endless chain of
the Price System. Men work so that they may consume, and consume so
that they may have strength to work some more so that they may
continue to consume, while close behind comes the grim spectre of
scarcity. To protect themselves they saved themselves into the jaws of
unemployment. Savings built machines.
<P>
When electric power came, human labor lost.  Electric power works
twenty-four hours and it draws no wages, but the owners pile up
savings. More savings, more machines, more production, more machines,
less wages, less purchasing power, less employment, larger relief
rolls, over production. Still more dividends are being paid and still
more savings are being added to the debt structure. A considerable
part of the population have become paupers but they have to be clothed
and fed that the Price System might still be operated and savings
steadily increased. Production slowed down. Fewer new machines for a
time and a steadily increasing liquidity in the banks and financial
institutions.
<P>
Today, liquidity is approaching its maximum and soon the banks,
insurance companies, and financial houses will fade quietly away,
except as governmental institutions.  They cannot earn enough to pay
their overhead and must go into voluntary liquidation or they will
fail. Any industrialist that does not modernize his equipment (and
that means mechanize) must shut up shop. With an ever increasing
velocity the Price System approaches its inevitable end. The Price
System is a gigantic debt system and the cancellation of debt is but
the foundations of that System crumbling into dust.  It is wisdom to
make your choice now, before you come to the parting of the ways. Then
it may-be too late. Which will you have? Chaos or Science?  Scarcity
or abundance? Disorder or order? Death or life? The choice is yours;
but the necessity for the choice cannot long be delayed. Technocracy
alone, offers life.
