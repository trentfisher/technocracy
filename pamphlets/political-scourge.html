<P>
Through the missed of the fourteen points, the clamor of the League of
Nations, and the speed of the ``may I knots,'' shrieks the siren of
the newspapers proclaiming the efficacy of some one political
programme as a panacea for the immediate ills. We have with us today
as many breeds of political parties as we have religious sects, all
advocating greater or lesser reforms, varying in their demands
according to the strata of society they represent, all antithetical to
each other, but all possessing one common factor, their belief in the
efficacy of political action.
<P>
Color, music, religion, morals and politics are subjective
realities. For the color-blind, as, for instance, those who fail to
perceive the greens, light of this color does not exist, although it
may for others.  Those of normal vision may have the sensation which
they call green light, which means, not that the green light is real,
but only that the impression is real to them. By the defective in
hearing, certain sounds may not be heard at all, although another man
may hear them clearly. Sound does not exist for one who is totally
deaf.
<P>
Religions, morals, and politics, being beliefs, create impressions
which are real to some people, to others are totally different,
varying in accordance with race, geographical location and economic
conditions, and to others, do not exist at all.
<P>
Political power is centered in the emotional expression of the mass,
and its adherence to the political party in power depends on the
amount of belief in each individual member.  Written on the flyleaf of
the book of rules of every able politician and statesman is that
sentence of Macchiavelli's, ``The appearance of belief in any popular
faith is as necessary as the belief in it is harmful;'' followed by
the addenda of Bismark, ``Religion, patriotism, and politics are the
primary weapons for controlling the mob.'' The political leaders of
the past and present have, through the inculcation of beliefs or
subjective realities into the minds of the mass, achieved for
themselves a goal which lies on a separate and distinct plane, and
does not concern itself with the objective realities of the mass. It
is the fervour of faith, the fanaticism of belief, the reaction of all
primal instincts and personal impressions that sweeps a candidate or
party into political power.If there existed that queer paradox, a
political party,based, not upon theory but upon actual facts, the
situation would not be such a hopeless one.
<P>
The structure of our present legislative bodies is composed of
representatives elected on the basis of geographical divisions, the
qualification of an electee consisting in the possession of a definite
amount of capital vested in real estate, bond, or other holdings. He
is not required to be involved in the production of any of the
essentials of life for his district, nor even to possess a knowledge
of the methods of production. We therefore have that queer anomaly of
a man being elected from a division, the important function of which,
for the country as a whole, is the production of coal, who is a
lawyer, and whose knowledge is limited to law and litigation; or we
have a doctor of medicine representing a steel district, or a banker a
farming district. Thus are made possible the debates which frequently
occur in Congress on the subject of operating railroads in which
lawyer, doctor, banker and professional politician participate with
equal ignorance, arguing away the nation's legislative time and
money. And though such an unrepresentative group may legislate, it
becomes still more innocuous through the fact that it does carry its
legislation into execution.
<P>
There are before the public at the present moment a number of
political expedients through which they are attempting to solve one of
our primary industrial problems, namely railroads. But the railroads
are only one unit of the industry of transportation and cannot be
dealt with separately and obtain efficient service in our common
carriers. Of all the plans presented not one has taken into
consideration the technique of this industry, or has apparently
realized that under scientific administration of our carrier system,
railroads must be secondary to that more efficient method of hauling
bulk cargoes, namely waterways -- depending, of course on the
geographical conformation of the country. Nor do they realize that the
motor trucks on our highways are relieving the railroads of an ever
increasing portion of their bulk freight.  Still again! Nor do they
realize that our transmission lines and our pipelines provide a better
method of transporting power and fuel than do our railroad coal-cars
and tank-cars.
<P>
The inadequacy of any plan, that proposes to allow the workers to
share in the profits of an industry, is that it places the basis of
efficiency not on scientific grounds, but on methods of management
that will obtain greater profits for all parties involved. If such a
plan were imposed on the transportation system of this country, it
would induce a condition so static that all other forms of
transportation would be discriminated against in order that the
railroad workers and railroad capitalists be enabled to maintain their
established earnings. The railroad interests in the past, by devious
financial and financially induced legal means, have killed every form
of water transportation in the United States excepting those required
by the railroad interests for their own ends. Our railroad interests
have chased the river steamer and the canal boat out of existence,
leaving them and their docks to disintegrate under the ravages of
time. In the majority of cases, the rivers and waterways of our
country are today paralleled, not only on one, but on both sides by
railroads. Under scientifically operated transportation, the
waterways, with feeder highways or short haul feeder railroads, would
relieve the present trunk line railroads of the United States of over
one-half of their freight load.  So it is that any political solution
to the railroad workers' problem endangers the transportation problem
of the entire nation. Efficient transportation is not only a matter of
carrying goods, but also of eliminating the unnecessary carrying.
<P>
In view of the complexity of the industrial situation in this country,
and the fact that the industries are so closely interrelated, any
fundamental change in the methods of operation of any one ;Industrial
unit would involve a corresponding change in every unit that is
correlated to it; and any method of scientific operation which might
be introduced in any separate unit would be immediately sabotaged by
the financial control, which is equally interlocked and correlated,
and thereby strangle at birth. The absurdity of any plan for the
operation of railroads (whether it be the Plumb plan, or it's
adversary, the Cummins bill) is immediately apparent when one is
brought into cognizance of the fact that the present group of railroad
interests own and control the sources of supply of power and fuel in
coal, oil, and water, and that they own and control the manufacturing
of railroad equipment, and in the further knowledge that the earnings
of the railroad groups are accentuated by the carrying of products
which they own and control in preference to transporting them by a
more efficient method, but one in which they have no vested
interest. The introduction of a scientific system of operation would
carry with it the scientific use of material inter-related with the
railroads, and the scientific use of one of these materials alone,
namely bituminous coal, which is one-third of all the freight moved on
common carriers would render it impossible for the railroads of this
country to earn dividends on their present capitalization.
<P>
We are living today in an industrial age which concerns itself with
the production and use of energy and matter in the forms of
electricity, steam, steel,lumber, cotton, etc. The amount of energy or
work required to produce a given amount of a certain material under a
given condition can be accurately calculated. The machine necessary
for the production of so many units of power can be accurately
designed. The resultant of a chemical reaction can be determined
before the reaction takes place. The candle power of a given amount of
electricity is a known factor. The food content of a bushel of wheat
of standard grade is an established fact. The production factor of the
worker can be determined under all conditions.
<P>
Political legislation cannot decide the question of the number of
hours a worker shall work in a given industry under a given condition,
or what materials, quantity and quality, shall be used, or the methods
of production, unless politics can correlate all industry.  Why be
carried away by the momentum of our multiple verbiage in the
discussion of the high cost of living? Why not consider the fact that
only one in ten of our population is engaged in actual production?
<P>
Why allow a million petty stores to muddle up the problem of retail
distribution with their inefficiencies? Why not eliminate 75 percent
of the inefficiency and the individuals engaged in this trading, by
consolidation into scientific distribution depots on a large scale,
putting the 75 percent of the men no longer needed into essential
production?
<P>
Why insist upon the different agricultural industries being personally
operated by any method that the individual farmer cares to adopt? Why
not industrialize agriculture by operating large areas as industrial
units, vesting the personal rights of the farmer, not in possession,
but in an equity of productive effort?
<P>
Why mine bituminous coal for the production of power? Why waste
fifteen-sixteenths of its multiple content by burning it under
boilers? Why not develop the remaining 97 percent of our water-power
resources in this country?
<P>
Why operate manufacturing establishments 2,000 miles from their source
of supply? Why not have manufacturing establishments located in the
center of their source of supply, or as nearly so as possible?
<P>
Why have the ill-health of a citizen be an incentive to profiteer on
the part of our medical profession? Why not have public health and
hygiene nationally operated on the basis of service?
<P>
Why have the security of the individual from starvation be the income
provider for the insurance companies?  Why not have it that the
individuals social service contract with the state provides him with a
livelihood until death?
<P>
Why involve ourselves in the discussion of the laws and the
inefficiencies of our law courts?  Why not eliminate the major number
of inefficiencies by cancelling all causes of litigation?
<P>
Why indulge our national vanity in wasting effort, time, and materials
in the production of gold as a ballast for international treasuries,
necessary with a gold basis currency?  Why not have a currency that
one cannot store up to rust, and that thieves cannot steal, of
purchasing value only to the individual to whom it is issued in
exchange for his productive effort?
<P>
Why tolerate the throttling of our industrial life by politicians and
political action? Why not eliminate all politics and political action
by instituting an industrial organization composed of men who, by
their training and experience, have the knowledge of operation and
direction?
<P>
Why the demand for higher wages? Why the higher prices?  Why not a
system of industrial operation wherein one would obtain, not a wage
that is in the ratio of 8 percent to his productive effort, as exists
today, but 69.3 percent, the remaining 30.7 percent being no tribute
to capital, but the normal contribution of each citizen to the
requirements of replacement and depreciation and the maintenance and
operation of the administration and it's indirect industries, such as
education, sanitation, etc.
<P>
These questions are not of a destructive character; individually they
may seem so, but as components of a sequence they partially reveal the
possibilities that would develop in a plan, nation-wide, that was not
political, but industrial, wherein production would be for use, not
for price.
<P>
It is possible under a system of scientific administration to increase
the present standard of living over 800 percent. The day is pregnant
with the need of just such a readjustment.  There can be no cessation
to industrial unrest so long as the conditions heretofore mentioned
persist. They are blocking the wheels of the industrial
mechanism. Given a plan or design of industrial administration the
movement of the mass can be directed into constructive channels,but,
without such, the country shall be plunged into a maelstrom beside
which the Russian revolution is but a tempest in a tea-pot; no, not a
maelstrom, but an eruption of mud.
