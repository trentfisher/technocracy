<H1>The Technologist Looks at Social Phenomena</H1>
(formerly titled The Technologist Looks at the Depression)

<P>
The state of bewilderment and sense of futility that hang like
a pall over the peoples of Christendom are commonly laid to the
Great War and the strange peace, conceived in terms of mutual
defeat, that marked its provisional close. These events are viewed
as the immediate causal circumstances that gave rise alike to the
decade of golden opportunities and its collapse in the relentless
retreat of `values' that continue to march past day after day in
columns of three--`high,' `low,' `close.'
<P>
But, as everyone knows, there were more remote events out of
which the Great War and the unstable peace unfolded. And so,
historians, statesmen, philosophers, economists, bankers, business
men, and politicians explore the background in search of the
`fundamental' causes which they discuss in conflicting accounts of
their explorations. Thus we are buffeted by events and by currents of
opinion which bewilder and confuse.
<P>
Living in the twentieth century, these explorers of the past
would go to their work under guidance of the twentieth century
point of view. But it happens in this fourth decade of the twentieth
century that the current point of view covers an extremely wide
area of thought with rapidly shifting frontiers. Within its boundaries
the ancient principles (habits of thought) which guided men's
action in the days of pagan antiquity still do service. We rationalize
and debate after the manner of the schoolmen of the Middle Ages:  we
think and act under the principles of right, equity, propriety, duty,
belief, and taste as stabilized in the days of the handicraft guilds
of Central Europe.
<P>
But during the last century and a half a series of ever-changing
material factors unfolded at an accelerating rate within the field of
industrial activity. Coincident with the introduction of these
swiftly moving technological changes there developed, both
independently and consequent upon their introduction, a new
matter-of-fact way of looking at facts and events and of dealing with
an ever-increasing range of problems--the modern, scientific point of
view.
<P>
The eighteenth century saw the introduction of the powered
machine, which was first conceived as an extension of the hand
operations of craftsmen. The close of the nineteenth century witnessed
the machine process occupying a dominant place in the technological
scheme and reshaping men's habits and methods of thinking.
The turn of the century marked the introduction and the accelerating
rise, under guidance of science, of the modern, continuous
technological processes of production. In this new industrial order
the machine was no longer conceived as an extension of the hand
tool; it became a moving mechanical element in a sequence of
events, the course and rate of which had been arranged and ordered
in strict accordance with the exact quantitative calculations of
science. Men in the fields of scientific inquiry and technological
research, the same as those directly engaged in technological
employment, gradually ceased to think in terms of workmanlike
efficiency of a given cause working to like effect: they began to
think in terms of <dfn>process</dfn>.
<P>
The work of accounting for the present state of affairs falls,
naturally, to those whose interest and preoccupations revolve about
the institution of absentee ownership with our system of pecuniary
evaluation and pecuniary canons of taste. They explain the present in
terms of this institution, its system of evaluation, and the
range of faiths and beliefs that stand to support it. It follows that
these men who so attempt to account for the present situation, as
well as those who are called upon to do something about it, are
drawn from occupations most widely removed from the technological and
scientific thought and activities which serve to mark off
and distinguish the last half century from the entire period of time
that lies in the background.
<P>
But the men of science and of technology are likewise concerned
with the present precarious state of the common welfare and the
general atmosphere of futility, and it is not to be wondered at that
they should turn their attention to the causal circumstances out of
which the present condition of affairs unfolded. Nor is it to be
wondered at that they should interest themselves in what should
be done about it.
<P>
<H3>A Normal Course of Events</H3>
<P>
They read the accounts of historians, statesmen, and economists
with their constant references to a `normal' course of things. To
the scientist, this insistence upon a `normal' course of things or a
beneficent run of events bars out any serious consideration of the
explanations offered. Nor do these scientists and technologists
understand why all these explorers should forever busy themselves
with the facts of ownership and pecuniary values while ignoring
altogether the accelerating rate of change that is going on in the
processes of technology. They do not understand the current accounts
of what has happened or the proposals as to what should be
done about it. For the entire range of facts and events dealt with
lies completely outside the range of facts and events with which
they are concerned in their own accounts, viz., the accelerating rate
of change in the state of the industrial arts and the corresponding
accelerating rate of energy conversion. To these men of matter-of-fact
and of quantitative measurements, with their knowledge of
our energy resources and our ways and means of turning them to
the account of the common welfare, the current proposals looking
toward a return to better times are utterly beside the point.
<P>
A cleavage has arisen within the field by which things and events
are apprehended. The words, phrases, and concepts of modern
science and of technology which pass current among men engaged
in scientific research and in technological production have no meaning
whatsoever to those engaged in business and the affairs of the
market, or who direct the financial affairs of corporations, states,
or nations. And by the same token, to the men accustomed to the
exact quantitative measurements of materials and work--that is to
say, to the quantitative measurements of energy resources and
energy conversion' and to the men who deal with the problems of
balanced load, the current discussions--of `value,' of fluctuating
prices, of the gold standard, of changing interest rates, of items of
pecuniary wealth which are at the same time items of debt--are
merely discussions looking toward a readjustment of the factors
which prevent them from doing their work. For the modern technologist
does not view production as a process that terminates at
a point which may be designated as F. 0. B. plant. Production
would be a meaningless activity if the goods produced could not
be utilized. Hence, they view the matter of production and
distribution as a single problem-the technological problem of
(quantitatively) balanced load.
<P>
Through endless books, magazines, newspapers, and reports of
conferences and discussions we are familiar with what the statesmen,
bankers, economists, business men, and philosophers have to say
as to what brought on this depressing state of affairs and as to what
should be done about it. While men in the field of science have
occasionally explored the general field of the past and have voiced
opinions as to the present, the men in technology have had little
to say. Since the technologist occupies the center of the stage in
the field of modern industry, we may well ask him to indicate what
he finds when he explores the background, and what he finds when
he looks in his matter-of-fact way at current events.
<P>
<H3>Factual History</H3>
<P>
When the technologist explores the past, his interest centers,
naturally, upon items of evidence which disclose the methods--the
techniques--through which man has turned the things of his environment
to account. The records of archaeology yield relatively
little that he can use; for men in this field have been preoccupied
with other matters than the state of the industrial arts, quantitative
measurements of the energy resources available in a given case, and
the quantitative relation between the rates at which man has been
able to convert energy to use forms. But even so, from the fragments
of archaeological explorations and the more recent explorations of
scientists, he has been able to put together the outlines of
a quantitative record of the changing states of the industrial arts
and men's unfolding ability to turn the energy resources of his
environment to account. And the outstanding feature of that record
is the controlling nature of the prevailing technology at any given
time upon the course of subsequent events--that is to say, upon
social change. From the viewpoint of the technologist, man has
experienced but few sweeping social changes--that is, few conversion
changes in the rates of energy; and these are widely separated
in point of time. The domestication of the crop plants and the
development of them in a dim, historic past thrust man into a larger
control of his environment--that is, to use a technological term,
into a new <dfn>energy state</dfn>. In the same way, the domestication of
animals gave him new powers to command and carried him a little
further along the way of control. The introduction of these factors,
each in its turn, wrought revolutionary changes in the social scheme
under which he had lived.
<P>
But following these two technological changes man did little
from the dawn of history to the middle of the eighteenth century
to increase his powers or to alter his energy state. What man
could produce during that long period was largely a matter of
what he could produce with his hands. Vast stores of energy were
available then, as now, but his use of them--his ability to convert
energy to use forms--was largely limited to the rate at which he
could turn the energy of the food which he consumed into work
performed by hand. Man's own body, whether free or slave, was
the only energy conversion engine available over a period of countless
centuries.
<P>
Up to the middle of the eighteenth century the number of man
hours required to cultivate an acre, or to quarry a yard of stone or
to transport it, or to perform any given piece of work, remained
approximately the same as was the case of 6,000 years earlier. We
are in the habit of thinking of this stretch of some sixty centuries
as one of ever-changing social schemes. It is true, forms of
government passed, one after the other; and cultural patterns ran
their course from Ancient Egypt, Greece, and Rome, to the Middle Ages
and the Renaissance of Europe. But to the technologist these sixty
centuries cover a steady state of man's ability to deal with the
material factors of his environment. They cover a steady state in the
rate of energy conversion.
<P>
For, during the entire period, the standard of living--the common
welfare--was definitely, quantitatively limited to the work
that man could do with his hands, tools, and a few crude machines
that added little to his power.
<P>
That these sixty centuries of recorded history constitute a steady
state in respect to the industrial arts, technology and the rate of
energy conversion and the social and political schemes that unfolded
during the period, will be more readily apprehended when
we deal, quantitatively, with the magnitudes of energy resources
available during the entire period, and the rapidly accelerating
rate of change that has taken place during the last century and a half.
<P>
Before we may proceed with the technologist to an examination
of the present social structure it will be necessary to establish an
understanding as to the meaning of certain terms that he constantly
uses and as to what it is that he rates as important.
<P>
<H3>The Language of the Technologist</H3>
<P>
When he looks at the world he notes that everything that moves,
including the human body, does so by an <dfn>expenditure of energy</dfn>
which may be expressed in terms of <dfn>calories</dfn> or
<dfn>joules</dfn>. An automobile
does work because it is able to utilize the heat energy
contained in gasoline. A waterwheel turns by utilizing the energy
contained in the water in motion at a waterfall. The human body
runs by means of the energy contained in the food it `burns.' All
of these are measurable in calories or joules. And he rates this as
a fact of great importance.
<P>
All forms of heat-transfer, or of work done, are said to involve
a transfer of energy-energy being the capacity for doing <dfn>work</dfn>.
Thus a waterfall is continuously expending energy regardless of
whether this energy is utilized or not. If a pound of coal is burned,
the energy in that coal may or may not be used to drive an engine
or to do other work. But whether or not work is done, after the
coal is burned the energy it contained has been irretrievably spent.
It is through the expenditure of energy that we convert all raw
materials into use forms and,operate all the equipment which we
use. It is through the expenditure of energy that we live.
<P>
Now, we can measure the heat energy contained in a pound of
coal by burning the coal in a tightly closed vessel surrounded by
water and noting the rise in temperature of the water.
<P>
One <dfn>kilogram calorie</dfn> of heat is the amount of heat required to
raise the temperature of one kilogram (1 kilogram = 2.2 lbs.) of
water one degree centigrade.
<P>
Likewise, the unit of work is the erg or the joule. One joule
is the amount of work required to lift a one pound weight to the
height of 0.7373 feet. One joule is equal to ten million ergs.
<P>
Also, there is a definite relation between work and <dfn>heat</dfn> or
between joules and calories. If we let a one pound weight fall through
a height of 0.7373 feet in such a manner that all of its energy is
converted into heat--instead of turning a pulley or lifting a weight--
one joule of work is also done. This, in turn, will produce enough
heat to raise 0.239 grams of water 1 degree centigrade, or heat
equivalent to 0.239 gram-calories (1 gram-calorie = 1/1000
kilogram-calorie).
<P>
It is in these terms that the technologist thinks when he considers
the `standard of living,' rather than in dollars, pounds and shillings,
francs, marks, or rubles.
<P>
In all social systems there are various forms and amounts of
motion. Stated positively, <dfn>social change</dfn> involves a change in the
technique whereby people live. We shall define as a social steady
state any society in which the quantity per capita of physical motion,
or energy expended, of the whole society shows no appreciable
change as a function of time. Such a society would be one in which
the methods for the production of commodities and operation of
services do not essentially change.
<P>
On the other hand, a society wherein the methods of obtaining
a livelihood, or the average quantity of energy expended per capita,
undergo appreciable change as a function of time, is said to exhibit
social change.
<P>
Since social change has been defined above in terms of physical
action, then any method of its measurement must likewise be physical
and all social activity whether in a steady or changing state
must obey the laws of physics and must likewise be subject to the
limitations imposed by those laws.
<P>
The fundamental physical concept for relating and measuring
all forms of physical activity is that of work, or energy expended.
By work the physicist means the application of energy to mass to
produce a resultant change of state.
<P>
<H3>Energy Conversion and Society</H3>
<P>
Upon this basis we can measure quantitatively the physical status
of any given social system. Take any <dfn>non-machine</dfn> society: The
total energy used by that society is the energy of the food eaten by
man and his domestic animals, and the fuel burned. Man himself
is the chief engine. The energy per capita is this total amount
expended divided by the population.
<P>
Prior to the advent of modern science and technology a little
more than a century ago, it is doubtful whether any society had
ever exceeded an extraneous energy consumption of 2,000 kilogram
calories per capita per day. Since all human activity is determined,
quantitatively, by the amount of energy consumed, we can truly say
that all history, until recently, has not witnessed an appreciable
social change, in the sense herein defined.
<P>
The steady state of any social system of the past was set up and
limited as such because no nation in history possessed any other
engine of energy conversion than that of the human being, limited
in size from 125 to 200 pounds and in total output to 1,500,000
foot-pounds per eight hour day. The rate of doing work of the
human engine laid down the limits of mechanical operation of
any social unit possessing this type of engine alone. No change in
the rate of work done in any social system was evident until after
the advent of technology in the early nineteenth century. The
introduction of other engines of energy conversion in the nineteenth
century, and the discovery of new materials and new energy sources
in the last hundred years, have brought about a change of rate
impossible of envisagement in any social system founded on the human
engine. Not until other energy resources became available
through other engines of energy conversion was man in his engine
category relieved from the age-long limitations of one of the lowest
rates of output per weight for size we know of. The human engine
in an eight hour day is only capable of producing work approximately
at the rate of 1/10 horsepower during that time. 
<P>
The first engine of energy conversion other than the human
body, free or slave, that was of social significance, was the crude
Newcomen atmospheric steam engine of 1712, of approximately
seven horsepower. This engine reached its maximum in 177.2 in
the Chasewater development with an energy conversion of 76
<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> hp.
Here is a 765-fold increase of rate over the human engine. In the
late eighteenth century, Watt brought out the first true steam
engine. This type reached its maximum in the 2,500 hp. Corliss at
the Centennial Exhibition of 1876. The reciprocating engine of
conversion reached its maximum rate of output in the marine
triple-expansion development of the '90's. In this type the rate
of energy conversion jumped to 234,000 times the rate of the human
engine, as calculated on a twenty-four hour basis, for this engine
can work three shifts every day.
<P>
The introduction of the turbine and the waterwheel brought
in still newer types of energy conversion. While the first turbines
ever made were less than 700 hp. per unit, and the first turbine
ever installed in a central station was only 5,000 hp., they have risen
in rated output until units of approximately 300,000 hp. are operated
today--3,000,000 times the output of a human being on an
eight hour basis. But the turbine runs twenty-four hours a day.
Therefore the total output of the above turbine is 9,000,000 times
the rate of output of the first engine of energy conversion socially
used.
<P>
The first station turbine consumed 6.88 pounds of coal per kw.
hour in 1903. By 1913 the central station coal consumption in the
U. S. had fallen to 2.87 pounds per kw. hour; in 1929 the average
was approximately 1.2; today, the more efficient stations are
operating at less than 1 pound per kw. hour.
<P>
From 6.88 to less than one pound measures this rate of change
in three decades.
<P>
Waterwheels were known to the ancients, but even in the eighteenth
century, the most efficient size of waterwheels seemed to be
limited to twenty feet in diameter, although larger ones were built.
The famous pumping machine at Marly which worked the fountains
at Versailles was driven by fourteen waterwheels which delivered
75 hp. in actual work, or not more than 5 hp. per wheel. The
waterwheels of the Middle Ages and the ancients can be dismissed,
therefore, as primitive toys, as their installation costs in most cases
were not justified by the small increase in the energy conversion
rate which they made possible. Their installation was not practical
until the development by Fourneyron in 1832 of his original 50 hp.
turbine type wheel. In 1855 an 800 hp. turbine was installed in
the Parisian water works at Pont Neuf. Thompson and Francis
developed the crude reaction water turbine, but the perfection of
this type of engine did not come until after the development of the
steel industry and the discovery of electrical generation.
<P>
The water turbines installed in Power House #1 at Niagara
Falls have risen in size from 5,000 hp. each in 1891 until today
we build them over 60,000 hp. and could build 100,000 hp. units,
were it necessary.
<P>
Just as we can say that the maximum rate of output of ancient
Egypt rarely exceeded 150,000 hp: for eight hours on a basis of
1,500,000 adult workers, we can point out that prior to the first
quarter of the nineteenth century of our own era, engines of
conversion were under two hundred pounds in average weight with
an output of 1/10 hp. per unit, per eight hour day.
<P>
When, only a century ago, the first significant change in the rate
of energy conversion occurred, it marked the beginning of a social
change, the magnitude and rate of which had never been dreamed
of by a pre-nineteenth century brain. But once under way, wave
after wave of technological development has swept the processes
of each decade into yesterday's seven thousand static years. The
first engine, developed by Newcomen, did not survive the century.
The second change in energy conversion only survived a century
to be replaced by a newer engine of higher output. For six thousand
years of social history no change in the rate of doing work
was effected, except that in the metabolism of the human engine
of conversion due to dietary changes. Within the last hundred
years we have multiplied the original output rate of that human
engine by 9,000,000, in a modern energy conversion unit. Most
of this 9,000,000 (or 8,766,000) has occurred in the last twenty-five
years.
<P>
This tremendous acceleration in the rate of doing work has
altered the entire physical complex of social existence. We are
able to produce physical substances and forms impossible of production
except where a tremendous energy input per day is available. We gather
the materials and produce physical forms that
could not have been attempted nor probably even envisaged in
a social mechanism possessing only that low rate engine of conversion,
the human being. This tremendous acceleration in the
rate of doing work has reached a point at which the energy available
is in such huge volume that we can affect transformations at
continually accelerating rates proportional to the amount of energy
consumed per given unit of time.
<P>
<H3>Change in the Order of Magnitude</H3>
<P>
The social mechanisms of the past six thousand years had no
means of energy conversion available other than the human body.
When tillage was a matter of spading the soil, a man could spade
about one-eighth of an acre per day of twelve hours, or at the rate
of ninety-six man hours per acre. Today, the large tractor-drawn
sixty disc or duck foot of modern power farming has reduced the
man hours per acre to 0.088. Thus we have reached a rate of
tilling soil which is more than eleven hundred times that of the
human engine.
<P>
Brickmakers for over five thousand years never attained on the
average more than 450 bricks a day per man; a day being over ten
hours. A modern straightline continuous brick plant will produce
300,000 bricks a day with twenty men on the machine. Even a
century ago in these United States one man produced not more
than twenty-five tons of pig iron per year, while it took another
man a year to produce eight hundred tons of iron ore. In 1929
in one pit we mined ore on the Mesabi Range at the rate of 20,000
tons per man per year and in six weeks moved a greater tonnage
than that of the Khufu pyramid at Gizeh, while our best blast
furnace technique has made it possible for thirty men working in
crews of ten to produce 300,000 tons per annum, or for one man to
produce at the rate of 10,000 tons of pig iron per annum.
<P>
In 1830 the United States had slightly over 12,000,000 population and
was witnessing but the crude beginnings of new means
of energy conversion; for at that time from coal and timber it was
producing less than seventy-five trillion B.T.U. (British Thermal
Units) per annum in order to drive its factories, its ships, and
operate all other equipment. Nineteen twenty-nine saw the
United States with a population of approximately 122,000,000--an
increase of ten times; but its energy produced had risen to almost
twenty-seven thousand trillion B.T.U. or 353 times the energy
conversion from the coal and water power of 1830.  Most of this
increase has occurred since 1900, for in that year we only produced
eight thousand trillion B.T.U.
While our bituminous coal production has leveled off to slightly
over 500,000,000 tons per annum, we have been consuming
ever-increasing amounts of gas, oil, and hydroelectric power, tending,
temporarily at least, to limit the total rate of coal consumption.
<P>
We are face to face with an immediate depletion of certain energy
and mineral resources in combination with this rising productive
capacity. We may very well ask ourselves where we shall obtain
the iron ore of the future even if there were no other wastes involved,
when we consider the annual depletion due to the production of
22,000,000,000 tin cans, most of which go to decorate our garbage
dumps.
<P>
Assuming that we have the same number of oil consuming units
(motor cars) as we have today, we may also ask where the oil is
going to come from in the next ten or twenty years. Oil production
rose from its discovery in 1859 to 64,534,000 barrels in 1900. In
1929 it had jumped to a billion barrels a year. Let us realize that
the average oil pool drops 96 percent from flush flow within four
years. Of the approximate 1,000,000 oil wells drilled on the North
American Continent since 1859, oil is still coming from 323,000
wells, but less than 6,000, or about 2 percent, of the latter supply
the bulk of our oil.
<P>
<H3>Results of Technological Advance</H3>
<P>
If one plots a graph of the production capacity expansion of any
basic industry on this Continent, such as iron or steel, for the last
100 years, he will note that the industry showed no great development
until about 1870. After 1870 and until the turn of the century the
development of every basic industry increased at a rate
which accelerated with time (in other words, the annual rate of
increase of production was itself increasing with time).
<P>
Finally, in the development of each industry, a point was reached
after which the rate of expansion became less each succeeding year--
the rate of production capacity expansion changed from a period
characterized by an ever-increasing acceleration to one of an
ever-decreasing acceleration.
<P>
The point on the curve at which this occurs is called the `point
of inflection.' The point of inflection for American railroad
development occurred in 1900. The inflection point on a composite
curve, made up of the basic industries in the United States, occurred
about the year 1921.
<P>
Similarly, if one plots the total number of plants or amount of
physical equipment for any basic industry during the last hundred
years, he will note that the total number of plants increases with
time until their total reaches a maximum. Then, with technological
improvement and resulting quantity production methods, obsolescent
equipment is abandoned and the total number of operating plants
declines.
<P>
This is clearly illustrated, for instance, by the clay products
industry. In 1849 there were 2,121 plants in the United States. The
number increased to a maximum of 6,535 plants in 1889, and then
by 1929 had declined to 1,749, or below the level of 1849, and all
this with an increasing rate of production and an increase in total
production capacity.
<P>
During the period of industrial development which we are considering,
the number of man hours of human effort required per 
unit output was greatest one hundred years ago, and has declined
steadily ever since, approaching the limit of zero in all our best
practices. The total employment in a given industry began small
and increased as the industry expanded until as a result of
technological improvement and larger scale mechanization the rate
of replacement of men by machines exceeded the rate of expansion,
of the industry, at which time a maximum of employment was
reached, and since when total employment has declined. It has
been observed in the major industries that, wherever mechanization has
taken place, employment or man hours tends to become
an inverse function of the rate of total output and, after passing the
peak, tends to decline proportionally to the decline of the energy
per unit produced.
<P>
In 1920 the railroads of the country employed 2,160,000 men; in
1930 they employed 1,518,000 men; and in December 1931, 1,164,000
men. In 1929 the carriage of freight was 6.3 percent greater
than in 1920.
<P>
The automobile industry reached its maximum employment,
exclusive of body and accessory plants, in 1923, producing 4,180,450
units with 241,356 employees. In 1929, with 226,116 employees and with
a total output of 5,621,715 cars, man hours per
car fell from 1,291 in 1904 to 133 in 1923 and again to 92 in 1929.
<P>
The flour milling industry had 9,500 plants in 1899, which increased
to a maximum of 11,700 mills in 1909, only to decline by
1929 to 4,022 mills. This industry had 32,200 wage earners in
1899, a maximum of 39,400 in 1914 and only 27,000 in 1929. The
wheat ground in the meantime increased continuously from 471
million bushels in 1899 to 546 million bushels in 1929.
<P>
These are merely averages from industries selected at random.
One of the more striking instances which might be considered is
the A. O. Smith plant in Milwaukee with its output of 10,000
automobile chassis frames per day with 208 men in the plant, or the
Corning electric lamp plant in New York with its output of 650,000
lamp globes per machine per day--an increase per man of 550 times
that of the method previously employed.
<P>
After 1850 displaced workers were reabsorbed in the expansion
of general industrial development. Machinery and equipment
could be made only by hand-tool methods; consequently tremendous
numbers could be reemployed. Today the development of
new industry does not mean any considerable increase in national
employment, except temporarily in its formative stages. The
moment a new industry reaches the state of organization defined as
complete mechanization or, in other words, when it becomes a
technological mechanism, employment drops sharply, always tending 
to further decrease. The production of new equipment for a new
industry today means no great change in the numbers employed
in machine tool fabrication, as the same process of mechanization
has occurred in this field as elsewhere.
<P>
<H3>Energy: Production and Population</H3>
<P>
All these changes have been made possible by the finding of
methods of generating energy other than that of human toil and
through the development of a concomitant technology. The cases
cited above are but a few instances of the effect of the new
methodology which is applicable to any process of production involving
repetitive action.
<P>
In a simple agrarian society the only means of increasing the
standard of livelihood was by the application of more human effort
to the soil resources, or, stating it in another way, only by
lengthening working hours. But by the application of technology we now
have reached the point where more goods are produced by increasing the
total amount of energy consumed and decreasing the energy
per unit produced--the process automatically resulting in a decrease
of the amount of human labor required.
<P>
It follows that, under our present system, if technology is extended
into more fields of social activity, the rate of production
tends to outstrip the rate of population growth and the rate of
possible consumption growth, causing simultaneously an ever-increasing
unemployment. This process is observable over the
period of the last thirty years in every industry for which statistics
are available, and this includes every major industry on the North
American Continent.
<P>
Malthus assumed sustenance to be the limiting factor of population
growth. Even today Dr. Pearl and Prof. East are worried over
sustenance requirements of the American social system of tomorrow. Of
the total per capita energy consumption of the United
States today only about 7 percent is directly involved in sustenance,
the remainder going toward the operation of the social mechanism.
The energy involved in the operation of our social structure here
in the United States is 15 times as much as the energy consumed in
sustenance. So, long before we of this present century have to concern
ourselves on this score, we shall be forced to predicate our
population growth on the probable rate of the energy conversion
of this Continent as a whole.
<P>
<H3>The First Social Change in History</H3>
<P>
When the technologist looks at the unfolding events of the past
six thousand years, he notes the same changes in political frontiers
and systems, in thought, and in theories of the outer manifestation
of the industrial arts, as noted by other men who have looked at
the same train of unfolding activities. But his insistence upon a
quantitative analysis of the technique whereby men have lived leads
him to view these changes in a new light. He speaks of the period
from the dawn of history to the middle of the eighteenth century
as six thousand static years because the social changes that occurred
during that period did not appreciably increase man's ability to
organize for his use the energy resources of his environment. The
changes that occurred were all, therefore, in his view, of a single
order of magnitude. In Egypt, Greece, Rome, and in Europe of
the Middle Ages, the social order succeeded in organizing a particular
area of the world's surface, and in operating it to obtain
the maximum security under its inherent limitations. These limitations
prescribed that its upper limits were 2,000 kilogram-calories
of extraneous energy consumption per capita per day. We have
no instance in previous social history of an agrarian economy that
exceeded these limits.
<P>
Social mechanics remained in this order of magnitude until the
advent of technology in the middle of the eighteenth century, after
which the limits of energy consumption rose in the United States
to 150,000 kilogram-calories per capita per day. This increase
from 2,000 to 150,000 kilogram-calories constitutes a social change
from one order of magnitude to another. In ancient social
mechanisms practically all of the total per capita energy consumption
was required for sustenance; in twentieth century America
approximately ninety-three percent of our total energy is consumed in
the operation of our social structure. Our society involves a greater
expenditure of energy per capita per day than any
other social mechanism, past or present. We have achieved a
fundamental social change which is susceptible to measurement in
physical units.
<P>
While the modern technologist lives and does his work under
the Price System he has to do his thinking in other than pecuniary
terms; there is no way of avoiding that. The nature of his work,
the facts, relations, and forces handled by him impose the use of
unvarying standards whereby he may make exact measurements.
His world is one of materials, energy resources, quantitative
relations, and rates of energy conversion. Without unvarying standards
of measurement the modern processes of production could
not be carried on. Quantitative measurements of materials, of
energy flow, of energy conversion, of work--constitute essentials.
<P>
While financiers and business men have occupied positions of
authority and control in the fields of production, the technologist
has designed the machines, the engines, and the continuous processes
that account for the present rate of energy conversion. Within narrow
limits he has worked with freedom, so that it may be
said that he has been the principal agent in bringing on the present
industrial capacity. But he has had nothing to do with the methods
of distribution. Financial business has not only exercised complete
control over this field and dictated what should be produced,
regardless of the resources available, but has also failed in the
distribution of the ever-increasing volume of goods and services
released by the accelerating rates of energy conversion.
<P>
<H3>The Necessity of Measurement</H3>
<P>
When the technologist looks at the processes of distribution, as
he is forced to do at the present juncture, a number of things thrust
themselves upon his attention. He notes immediately that all
measurements in this field of activity are made by a pecuniary stand
that is continuously variable, and that all relations are expressed
as prices. He notes that <dfn>price</dfn> controls the utilization of energy
resources, the rate of flow of materials and labor into the productive
processes, and the flow of goods and services into the field of use
or consumption. The only feature of the system that seemingly
cannot be brought under the jurisdiction of price control is the
rate of energy conversion, which is a function--that is to say, the
outcome--of man's increasing ability in turning things to account.
All this constitutes a situation which is obviously alien to the
technologist's world of thought, theory, and action.
<P>
When the technologist looks at the magnitude of our pecuniary
wealth, he notes that the items--bonds, mortgages, and instruments
of loan credit of one sort and another--which foot up to a truly
grand total, constitute the same items that foot up to an equally
grand total of debt. He also notes that pecuniary wealth cannot
be created without first creating a corresponding item of debt. For
the purposes of industry, these items are purely fictitious. But he
notes that there is a definite purpose behind the creation of these
fictitious items in the current scheme, and that they serve the
purpose for which they were created. He notes that they afford the
borrower a differential advantage in bidding against others for the
use and control of industrial processes and materials, and that they
afford him a differential advantage in the distribution of the
material means of industry. He also notes that they constitute no
physical addition to the material means of industry at large. It
is obvious to him that funds of whatever sort are a pecuniary fact,
not an industrial one; that they serve the distribution of the control
of industry, not its materially productive work.
<P>
Before the run of current events set in in 1929, this factual
statement of the case was not treated kindly by financiers and economists,
nor will it be looked upon with favor now.  But the nature and
meaning of pecuniary wealth is becoming more obvious day by
day. The rapidly diminishing `value' of our items of pecuniary
wealth (which are at the same time items of debt, the burden of
which is increasing at something like an inverse ratio) has in nowise
affected the material items of our industrial plant.
<P>
The technologist examines our so-called standard of measurement, the
monetary unit-the dollar. He notes that it is a variable.
Why anyone should attempt, on this earth, to use a variable as a
measuring rod is so utterly absurd that he dismisses any serious
consideration of its use in his study of what should be done. 
<P>
He also considers `price' and `value' and the fine-spun theories
of philosophers and economists who have attempted to surround
these terms with the semblance of meaning. These terms, like the
monetary unit, may have had meaning to men in the past but they
mean nothing whatsoever to the modern technologist. The standard of
measurement is not relevant to the things measured; and
the measuring rod and the things, measured as if they were stable,
are all variables. We read thousands of newspaper captions such
as this: `FARM VALUE CUT BY SLUMP TO 45 BILLIONS. PRESENT WORTH
COMPARES WITH 79 BILLION AT WAR'S END-OFF 15 PERCENT IN YEAR'
(1931) - And then we read that farm income has fallen from
$16,900,000,000 in 1919 to $6,900,000,000 in 1931. It is, of course,
quite possible to rationalize this in terms of the functions of the
Price System; but after it has been rationalized it still remains to
the technologist nothing more nor less than an item of nonsense.
He simply refuses to think of that item of our technological equipment
as waving up and down like that. It doesn't.
<P>
To bring production and distribution into balance under such
conditions would be much the same as attempting to determine
how many pounds of electrical current would come to balance on
a scale with a constantly increasing magnitude of fluctuating
density. To the technologist the problem of balanced load under the
Price System is a problem of that order of nonsense. It is not a
problem--it is an impossibility.
<P>
Moreover to maintain a balance between production and consumption,
with the number of factors involved, requires quantitative
calculations that lie beyond the frontiers of arithmetic. And
so the technologist does not blame the men of business, finance, and
politics for not doing what they are not prepared to do. But when
he examines the arithmetical impossibility of what they postulate
as quantitatively possible, the entire system of financial business
takes on the air of unreality; it becomes an impossible world of
fairy-tale and magic.
<P>
<H3>Requirements of the Price System</H3>
<P>
The criterion of successful operation of a modern industry under
the ancient Price System is that it shall make a monetary profit.
Another requirement of industry under a Price System is that it
shall consider among its expenses the payment of a monetary return
upon the capital investment in that industry.
<P>
Regarding the first of these requirements, considering other
factors to be constant for the moment, the profit possible from a
given industry is a direct function of the quantity that can be sold.
This fact is largely responsible for the ever-insistent demand of
business for an ever-increasing production rate and expansion of trade,
both domestic and foreign. From the point of view of the individual
manufacturer under a Price System, the ideal conditions for continued
prosperity are an infinite supply of cheap raw materials and
labor, and an infinite market, so that there will never be a decline
in the rate of increase of production.
<P>
In the internal operation of the industry, external factors being
considered for the moment constant, the amount of profit that can
derive from a given output is an inverse function of the internal
cost of production. It has been found that the most efficacious way
of reducing internal costs is by means of large scale quantity
production by processes as automatic as can be devised. This
requirement dovetails perfectly with the first, or increased output, and
the net result is the industrial trends that we have observed in our
analysis of the growth of industry on the North American Continent.
<P>
Another factor which acts in the direction of those already
enumerated, is that a monetary return must be paid by the industry to
the owner of the invested capital. This is in the form of interest
and dividends. In other words, the bonded indebtedness must draw
interest. Suppose the rate of this interest on investments is taken to
be 5 percent per annum. Consider the total capital investment in
the industries of this Continent. Industrial investment is made
largely by a very small percentage of the total population, and for
that reason the 5 percent return accruing annually is for the most
part re-invested in industry. In order that industry in turn can
continue to pay the same percent return on the added investment it
must expand by a similar increment of itself per annum. To continue to
satisfy these conditions industry would have to expand at
a compound interest rate--the rate of increase of production per
annum must itself continuously increase ad infinitum--which is a
physical impossibility.
<P>
Another way of increasing profits, under the laissez-faire competition
of a Price System, is to cut down the cost of production by
manufacturing inferior products. This will increase the number
of sales on an otherwise saturated market because of the resultant
increased replacement rate.
<P>
The mathematical, that is, the arithmetical impossibilities of
the assumptions which underlie what we are now attempting to do
may be readily seen.
<P>
Suppose we level production off (as is being done) until an ample
mean standard of living compatible with our resource supplies
could be provided for the inhabitants. Then under the Price System the
requirement to cut internal costs to a minimum would
result in an ever-increasing unemployment.  If, on the other hand,
an attempt were made to keep all the people employed, the increasing
rate of output per man hour would result quickly in an overproduction
of goods that would of necessity extend toward infinity.
<P>
Moreover, should industry level off, the lack of new industries
or expanded old ones in which to invest the returns already accruing
from existing investments, would tend to drive the interest
rate to zero.
<P>
<H3>The Order of Magnitude</H3>
<P>
<em>The problem in its last analysis is primarily one of the effects of
different orders of magnitude.</em>  The same fundamental characteristics
are inherent in the change of magnitude of any mechanism.
Consider, for example, vehicles of transportation. The ox-cart is
a sturdy, slow-motion vehicle. The driver of an ox-cart need have
no technical training except to call `whoa-haw' or `gee-haw.' If the
cart hubs a tree nothing happens. In fact there is no ordinary
error that such a driver could commit that would be of any great
consequence either to himself or his vehicle. Consider in like manner
the driver of an express train. He must always be awake and
alert. He must operate strictly according to the schedule and the
signals. Violation of any one of a large number of conditions can,
and probably will, wreck the train; and moreover the magnitude
of the wreck will be proportional to the mass and velocity of the
train. In a like manner the duty of a train dispatcher, who controls
the operation of not one train but many, is even more exacting.
Thus we pyramid from a single train to a railway system, and from
a railway system to a whole transportation system, and from a
transportation system to a whole industrial complex with the same
generalizations that the larger and higher powered the industrial
system, the more rigorously exacting must be its technical control in
order to avert a wreck, and that moreover the wreck resulting from
the lack of such control will be of an order of magnitude proportional
to the size and the rate of operation of that mechanism.
<P>
Against the picture of the man with the ox-cart or the man with
the hoe we now have the accelerating upward sweep of the energy
curves, and the curves of an enormous total production; the
accelerating declination of the curve of employment, involving millions
of men, and the still more violent fall of the curve of man hours per
unit produced--the sweep across the charts of all these curves,
dealing with unprecedented magnitudes and numbers, constituting 
unmistakable evidence that the whole system is due to go out of
balance in the not distant future.
<P>
<H3>The Disallowance of the Price System</H3>
<P>
What are we going to do under the conditions delineated above
to avert the disaster that science and technology view as highly
probable-which is science's way of saying unavoidable? This question
brings us to a subject exceedingly difficult to discuss: for habits of
thought and connotations differ fundamentally in the world
of business, banking, and politics from those that obtain in the
world of science, technology, and the field of materially productive
work. Items of ownership, credit, debt, monetary units of value--dollars,
shillings, etc.--or interest rates and relations, expressed as
prices, constitute the realities in the former world; but they are
unreal and fictitious items in the latter, where energy. resources,
materials, rates of energy conversion, and use-forms constitute the
real and basic things with which men deal.
<P>
Any scheme of social organization, designed to utilize our resources
and ability under conditions of security, offered by technology in the
name of science, will involve the disallowance of the
Price System. Such a proposal will appear revolutionary from the
viewpoint of the massive interests which now look after the far-flung
rights of ownership and seek vainly to keep the system under
control and in balance.
<P>
The present is unique in that the ancient ways of politics, and
the firmly established strategies of modern finance and business,
may be observed in operation, while the <dfn>ways of life</dfn> and
<dfn>habits of thought</dfn> are being transformed by the impact of
modern science and
the methods of modern technology. In contrast to the devious
ways of politics, the fumbling methods of finance and business with
the concomitant, mysterious movements of prices and values, and
the anthropomorphic discussions concerning what The Market
`wants to do'--all of which is carried as conspicuous news--we have
the methods of science and technology. Our daily life throws us
into intimate relations with the peculiar competence of modern
technology. Out of this contact we have developed a high regard
for the accuracy of its factual analyses, its mathematical
measurements and handling of materials and forces, and for the
validity of its procedure.
<P>
Although we live in a world of price and of speculation; of
ever-increasing magnitude of fluctuations of `value' of bonds, mortgages, 
equities, land, buildings, salaries, wages, savings; of numbers
unemployed and an ever-decreasing number of jobs available;--all of
which means the increase of insecurity and want, in the face of
rapidly-increasing industrial competence--these very things force
us to turn to science and technology, since the incompetence of all
other agencies prompts the progressive forfeiture of our esteem.
<P>
<H3>Science and Society</H3>
<P>
To modern civilized men, science has become the court of last
resort. The explanations offered in the name of science are accepted
under the new order of common sense within which we live
and do our work. And so at the present time we are witnessing in
the body of beliefs that stand to support the Price System and the
current institutional scheme, a repetition of what has taken place
repeatedly within the fields of belief which sought to support systems
and institutions beyond their allotted day.
<P>
When the oncoming march of physical science arrived in the
field of chemistry, it found its way blocked by alchemists,
Philosopher's Stones, and phlogistonites. Its pace was retarded, its
movement checked but for a moment, and it rolled on to occupy the
entire field once so completely filled with all manner of
superstitious theories and opinions. It ended with the total exclusion and
complete intolerance of the obsolete methods of philosophic
speculation in these fields. The same onward march has been
proceeding. It has driven the astrologer out of astronomy, the
geographer 
out of meteorology and seismology, the barber out of blood-letting,
and Providence out of the field of bacteriology.
<P>
Current events have already declared the pressing need for
change. Around us we hear the rumbling of discontent that voices
itself in Marxian philosophies, and the cry of fear that calls for a
dictatorship. And now come the men of physical science who state
in no uncertain terms that bolshevism, communism, fascism, and
democracy are utterly impotent to deal with the advanced technological
situation in which we, of the North American Continent,
find ourselves placed. None of these systems of thought and action
will be given the mandate when the present system fails to
function. North Americans are now calling upon physical science
and technology to extend the frontiers of their domain.
