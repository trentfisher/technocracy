<H3>PREFACE</H3>
<P>
This pamphlet consists of an exchange of letters between
Director-in-Chief of Technocracy Inc., Howard Scott, and
J.K. Faulkner which was thought to be of interest to the
public and was first published in <a
href="../periodicals/nwtechnocrat">The Northwest Technocrat</a>
of July 1965 (No. 220) along with two articles referred to in Howard
Scott's letters.
<P>
J. K. Faulkner, assistant professor of economics at Western
Washington State College, Bellingham, Washington, while
researching for a Ph.D. in Economics, had first contacted
various Sections of Technocracy Inc. in the northwest
before writing his first letter to Howard Scott.
<P>
Howard Scott's careful and complete response to Faulkner's
questions contain information about Technocracy's history
and purpose that is useful to a better understanding of
Technocracy.
<p>
<a href="political-scourge.html">The Scourge of Politics In the
Land of Manna</a> and <a href="political-schemes.html">Political
Schemes In Industry,</a> ironically enough, are a repudiation
of the political objectives of the I.W.W. publication in which
they were published, and politics in all other forms. But,
more important, the articles perceived the pattern of things
to come -- the advanced engineering concepts which
have since become Technocracy, the future design of
social operations for North America.

Dear Mr. Scott:
<P>
I expect by this time you have received a letter from Mr.
Harry Briggs indicating my interest in Technocracy, Inc.
<P>
I am working on a Ph.D. in Economics at the University of
Utah and I have taken as my dissertation topic Technocracy.
Technocracy has not received the attention in the
professional literature that its currency in the 1930's,
1940's should indicate. As a consequence of this, along
with an interest in Technocracy from my undergraduate days,
I have decided that this is what I would like to do:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>I.<DD>Trace the intellectual antecedents of this movement, and yourself
    in particular, for whatever impress or contribution may have been
    relevant in its formation.
<DT>II.<DD>It is also important to indicate the history of
    the movement from the initial formation of the
    Technical Alliance, to the first announcement
    of Technocracy on June 16, 1932 until present.
<DT>III.<DD>The other major factor which will probably be
    the most difficult is to indicate. well the theory
    of energy determinants, such that the economist
    as well as those that might pick up the thesis
    might tell something about Technocracy.
</DL>
<P>
With this rather brief outline indicating the general
direction of the dissertation, I would hope that you might
help me in this task. The following represent questions
which have plagued me, and while I am sure many of them have
been asked before by the press, it is important that you
answer rather than my being forced to go to these secondary
sources.
<ol>
<li>What influence did Soddy have on your theory of energy determinants?
<li>Do you feel in looking back over the period that Veblen, Bellamy,
    Frederick Taylor (scientific management) had much influence on
    your outlook of scientifically run state?
<LI>How does the prediction of the inevitable collapse of capitalism
    compare with that of Marx? 
<LI>Was there anything to the suggestion that you were active in the
    I.W.W.? (Outside of the two articles that you wrote for the <CITE>One
    Big Union Monthly.</CITE>)
<LI>Members locally point out that there were attempts to take over
    your ideas and the organization of Technocracy, and as a
    consequence of this it was incorporated. Could you tell me who was
    involved in this attempt, and something of the groups that sprung
    up to ``compete'' with Technocracy after the break at Columbia in January, 1933?
<LI>If you are free to give me information on membership, both
    historically and currently, I would appreciate having some idea of
    the relative figures both high and low between 1933 and present.
<LI>One of the recurring criticisms of the Technocrats was their
    refusal to indicate how the Technate might be accomplished.
    Admitting that with the collapse of the price system, something
    like the 'Technate could be installed, why would it? What factors
    make it a feasible alternative?  I am primarily concerned here
    with a refusal of the Technocrat to concern himself with political action.
<LI>There were some reports that the Technocrats had in mind the use
    of physical force (Chicago, April 1933) to accomplish their goal.
    I have found no explicit statement in any of your literature
    indicating that you subscribe to it, but neither have I found a
    way of accomplishing the Technate through political means. Could
    you elaborate directly on this?
<LI>Have you felt that Technocracy has had some influence on political
    affairs, despite your disavowal of participation in them?
<LI>What response, if any, did you receive from the U.S. Government on
    your offer to put the organization of Technocracy at their
    disposal during early 1942?
<LI>The major criticism that an economist makes of the technocratic
    distribution system is that it has no theory of value, no demand
    theory. It also seems implicit in the technocratic system that
    scale of the operation is not dealt with adequately. That is, it
    appears that you don't have to worry about the size of the firm or
    the plant or the unit.
<LI>One suggestion that I ran into somewhere suggested the
    distribution system was somewhat like the army. Could you comment? 
</ol>
<P>
I have been unable to find any theses that have been written
on Technocracy. If you have any knowledge of any being
written, I would very much appreciate hearing about it. I
am thinking now of those that might be in the process. I
have gone through the indexes and abstracts, but have not
found anything.
<P>
I would like very much to meet you. I hope that if I ever
have more than two dimes to rub together that I will be able
to get back to Rushland.
<P>
As this study progresses, I may have additional questions
which only you can answer, which I respectfully hope that
you will be able to do.
<P>
Sincerely,
<P>

(This letter of March 6, 1964 was followed by a letter of
April 16, 1964. We have omitted the latter, because it was
essentially the same as the former, except that, curiously,
it does not include question number 4 of the March 6
letter.)

<P>
Dear Mr. Faulkner:
<P>
Your letters of March 6th and April 16th, 1964, are at hand.
Sorry that due to travel absence from CHQ we have not
answered your correspondence sooner. We'll try to make
amends and, at least in the preliminary correspondence,
answer some of your questions.
<P>
In Section II, you state that it is important to indicate
the history of the movement from the initial formation of
the Technical Alliance until the present. That is indeed,
Mr. Faulkner, a tall order. If Technocracy Inc. had the
staff of ``Time,'' ``Life,'' and ``Fortune,'' or the ghost writers
available to the President of the United States we could
entertain a project of this magnitude without any qualms
whatsoever. But with our limited resources of personnel --
may I repeat -- that it is a large order.
<P>
We opened our first office in July 1918 at 107 Waverly
Place, just two buildings off Washington Square, New York
City and in 1920 we took a whole floor at 23 West 35th
Street. We still have at CHQ one of the Keuffel-Esser
drafting tables we had at 107 Waverly Place in 1918.
<P>
The Technical Alliance conducted its affairs under the
direction of a temporary committee, with Sullivan W. Jones,
Secretary. The temporary organizing committee was composed
of the following:
<P>
<PRE>
               Howard Scott, Chief Engineer

</PRE>
<P>
(The above taken from the original leaflet printed in 1919
by the DePamphilis Press of New York.)
<P>
I was on this committee, as you will notice, as Chief
Engineer and Exectutive Director. It might be interesting
to give some of the background of the members of the
organizing committee:
<P>
Frederick L. Ackerman was a well-known architect, designer
of buildings for Cornell University, big apartment
buildings, etc., etc. Dr. Carl L. Alsberg was chief chemist
of the Bureau of Chemistry, Department of Agriculture,
Washington, D.C. Allen Carpenter was a prominent doctor
practicing in New York City. L. K. Comstock was head of
Comstock Company, the largest electrical contractors in the
New York area and later the firm that had the entire
contract for wiring and lighting the 1939 New York World's
Fair. Stuart Chase was originally employed in a government
department, Washington, D.C. Dr. Alice Barrows Fernandez
was Deputy Director of United States Department of Education
in Washington, D.C. Bassett Jones was a member of the firm
of consulting engineers, Myers, Strong and Jones, consulting
to General Electric, Otis Elevators, etc., etc., and
co-developer with Clarence Birdseye of the Frozen Food
Process. Robert H. Kohn, was president of the American
Institute of Architects. Benton Mackaye originally was in
the Department of Forestry of the United States and he
worked for a time in the office of the Technical Alliance.
He later formulated and promoted and was the father of the
Appalachian Trail. His brother was Percy Mackaye,poet and
dramatist. Leland Olds was a statistician who became the
first secretary of the New York State Power Authority and
later was appointed by Franklin Delano Roosevelt to be
Federal Power Administrator of the United States in his
administration. Charles P. Steinmetz of the General
Electric needs no further elaboration.
<P>
Dr. Richard C. Tolman was professor of physics at the
University of Illinois, and during the latter part of World
War I and at the time of the Technical Alliance was director
of the Fixed Nitrogen Research Laboratory in Washigton, D.C.
He later became Dean of Physics at the California Institute
of Technology and when World War 11 began President
Roosevelt made him Atomic and Scientific representative of
the United States on the Combined Chiefs of Staff of United
States and Great Britain. John Carol Vaughan was a noted
surgeon, head of Vanderbilt Clinic and chief surgeon of one
of New York's hospitals. Thorstein Veblen, of course, you
are well acquainted with. He was an educator and occupied
various academic positions during his professional career,
the last of which was at the New School of Social Research
in New York City. Charles H. Whitaker was editor at that
time of the Journal of American Institute of Architects.
<P>
Early in 1920, the Technical Alliance took a whole floor at
23 West 35th Street. It is interesting to note in passing
that these same premises were occupied by a Section of
Technocracy in the middle 30's. During our tenure at 23
West 35th Street, Stuart Chase, Benton Mackaye and others
worked in the offices of the Technical Alliance. It is also
interesting to note that Mrs. Agnes Delima was my secretary
and stenographer in the Technical Alliance office at that
time. She later became secretary of the corporation of the
New School of Social Research, and served until her
retirement a couple of years ago.
<P>
During the time that we occupied the quarters at 23 West
35th Street, we received considerable publicity in
interviews published in the New York World and New York Call
Magazine and other papers and periodicals at that time. We
have full page originals in our scrap books here at CHQ.
This publicity, while it could not in anyway be compared to
the publicity of the 30's, still for that time was
considerable. Some of it was done by Charles W. Wood, one
of the best feature writers of the day, and interviewer of
such public figures as Ford, working with Collier's and
Saturday Evening Post. It was during this period that we
took on several research projects. The largest, the most
financially lucrative, was the job for the Railroad
Brotherhood, which occurred at the time of the Plumb Plan,
and it succeeded in breaking the front page of the New York
Times.Stuart Chase and Otto Byers were the chief workers,
the leadmen on this project. Otto Byers was a professional
engineer with the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, whom Franklin
Roosevelt later appointed Deputy Administrator of the Office
of Defense Transportation of the United States.
<P>
Another project which we undertook, of lesser magnitude than
the one of the Railroad Brotherhood, was for the Industrial
Workers of the World. We still have here at CHQ two long
blueprints listing the interlocking of over three thousand
corporations of the big five packers -- all totally owned;
equally impressive, of all those in which the five owned 50
percent or more. The Railroad Brotherhood and I.W.W. were
merely clients of the Technical Alliance and paid for the
services rendered. So therefore, referring to your question
#4, of March 6, 1964: ``Was there anything to the suggestion
that you were active in the I.W.W. outside of the two
articles you wrote for the <cite>One Big Union Monthly,</cite>'' may I
say your information is incorrect. I never was active in the
I.W.W. or in any organization, labor union or political
party, nor was I ever a member. The two articles in the One
Big Union Monthly were not written for the One Big Union
Monthly, but were written prior to this, at the time of
President Wilson's ``Fourteen Points,'' which you will find
enumerated in the first article. The reason for the
publication in the <cite>One Big Union Monthly</cite> was that the
Chairman of the Board of I.W.W. thought as they were
engaging us in a research project, they should have
something on which to publicize their relationship and their
necessary expenditures. We said we knew of some articles
and they seemed to be satisfied with them. We never heard
from the <cite>One Big Union Monthly</cite> after that.
<P>
In Question #1, you ask what influence Soddy had on our
theory of ``energy determinants.''
<P>
We derive most of our concepts of thermodynamics and energy
determinants from the works of J. Willard Gibbs, and we had
formulated most of our concepts of modulus and calculus of
design prior to our coming in contact with Soddy's <cite>Wealth,
Virtual Wealth and Debt</cite> in 1927. Frederick Soddy was a
chemist and scientist, completely unknown to us, as we were
unknown to Soddy. Soddy formulated his ideas in the British
scientific and academic world of his time. He starts out on
the correct course, and then gets lost in the muddle of values shortly after page 100, and he loses his original direction and analysis in the mass of money and economic values.
Soddy himself, in a newsreel interview taken in his office
and laboratory, presented in the early 30's a very nice
admission and commendation for the development of Technocracy in the United States. This newsreel, I believe, was a
Fox Movietone. We wish Soddy had gone on as he first
started, as a chemist and thermodynamicists and we feel that
he would have reached, ultimately, the same conclusions we
had arrived at.
<P>
Question #2 asks, ``do you feel in looking back over the
period that Veblen, Bellamy, Frederick Taylor had much
influence on your outlook of a scientifically run state?''
<P>
We had never read Veblen, nor had we any contact with him
until September 1918. He published a series of articles in
the ``Dial Magazine'' in 1919. We had had a series of conferences and seminars in 1919 in which Veblen and others
brought the economists and sociologists, and we brought the
scientists and engineers. The last five Veblen articles
appeared in the ``Dial Magazine'' from May 31, 1919, page 55,
to November 1, 1919, page 373. We objected to Veblen's
interpretation at that time and his advocacy of a Soviet of
Technicians, taking the position that social change on this
Continent would not be analogous to social change anywhere
else in the world. The ``Dial Magazine'' went out of existence as a magazine of public affairs and became a magazine
of poetry and culture, and the Johnsons, publishers, took
safaris in Africa. Osa appeared in many of the african
photographs.
<P>
Veblen faded out of the picture in New York after he left
the New School of Social Research, and declining health
limited his activities. At least his insight into many
things was quite interesting. Whether he would have gone on
and been able to envisage an operating social mechanism of a
technological socialization for the distribution of
abundance, in all kindness, we cannot say.
<P>
Bellamy was an artist and did a lovely job in his ``Looking
Backwards'' and his other book, ``Equality.'' But we would
like to point out that Jules Verne in his book, ``Twenty
Thousand Leagues Under the Sea,'' envisaged a marvelous
submarine. The book was so intriguing that it enjoyed a
world-wide sale. Nevertheless, no naval architect or designing engineer would attempt to design a submarine from Jules
Verne's artistic concepts displayed in his ``Twenty Thousand
Leagues Under the Sea.'' It just wouldn't work. The same can
be said of Edward Bellamy. Edward Bellamy's was an idealistic projection. He had the intuitive feeling of the artist,
but it also was entangled in human beings on the theory they
could be elevated to such a high degree of perfection in
their moral and ethical values that a new society could be
made to function on the essence of their betterment.
<P>
Frederick W. Taylor developed his theories of scientific
management while working at the Midvale Steel. Out of his
Midvale Steel experiments with time studies and that big
husky Dutchman that he had as lead man in his pig iron gang
at Bethlehem Steel, Frederick Taylor came up with a set of
guide rules on how management could obtain greater productivity from labor by making human labor more efficient.
<P>
Taylor's series of scientific time studies and measurements
of work (human effort) , scored quite a hit in the era
preceding World War I and just after World War 1.
<P>
A number of engineers became so-called disciples of
Frederick W. Taylor, even though he had passed on to his
reward in 1915. A considerable number of engineers took up
the so-called scientific management of Frederick Taylor and
further embroidered it and publicized themselves as
efficiency engineers and management consultants. Henry L.
Gant had been Taylor's assistant at the Midvale Steel and
the Bethlehem Steel Company. Gant, Morris L. Cook,
Leffingwell, Emerson, H. K. Hathaway, Frank B. Gilbreth,
Harlow S. Person and C.J. Barth were among the many
prominent advocates of Taylor's efficiency system with some
variations. Gant, Barth and others tried to start an
organization, ``The New Machine.'' ``The New Machine'' never
got off the ground; all of them wrote articles and delivered
papers in the engineering societies and management
conferences. But their chief purpose was in creating a
national image so they could sell their services to large-scale private enterprise as scientific managers and
efficiency engineers who would be able to install the system
that could extract more productivity from the American
worker. We never had any use for Taylor nor any of the
efficiency or scientific management crowd. They never
realized that human toil was the last thing in the world you
had to be efficient about; the only way to be really
efficient is to eliminate it entirely, and this would have
been heresy to any of the Taylor, Gant, Barth, Cook
efficiency crowd. It is sad to contemplate that men of the
technical ability of the names mentioned in this paragraph
were so lame in their thinking and social outlook that they
missed the boat so completely. Who in hell wants to be
efficient with a shovel, and what sense would there be even
if you succeeded? They should have had their heads opened
with a shovel, it might have been more effective.
<P>
The formulation of our concepts began prior to World War I
and during World War I and developed from then on. Some
interesting examples: We had already developed our
Continental Accounting system with our geographical division
numbers, namely, a combination of the latitude and longitude
of the southeast corner of a quadrangle, giving you an
accurate location of any place on the Continent or the world
without respect to political boundaries, place names or
languages. This in conjunction with the conductivity
characteristics of carbon coding with a modified Dewey
decimal system enables one to devise a Continental
accounting system and medium of distribution, becoming at
once a Continental accounting system and continuous
inventory of both production and distribution on an hourly
basis, Continent-wide. You have to bear in mind, of course,
that the system was devised before computers were developed
to handle the instantaneous computation necessary under this
system. We preceded the computers by some years. We
brought out our million and a half volt D.C. power
transmission in 1923. We brought out our calendar prior to
that, in 1921 and 1922. We are stating this merely to give
you some idea of the periodicity of the development of
events of the organization and its concepts.
<P>
Question #5 asks, ``Members locally point out that there were
attempts to take over your ideas and the organization of
Technocracy and as a consequence of this it was
incorporated.''
<P>
The incorporating papers of Technocracy Inc. were originally
drawn up in the fall of 1932. This was done primarily to
restrain the terrific flood of unauthorized material, from
every writer from the far right to the far left attempting
to climb aboard the bandwagon. The granting of the charter
<P>
of incorporation of Technocracy Inc. was delayed for some
months due, apparently, to political pressures brought to
bear in Albany, the capital of the state of New York. We
regret that the charter was not issued in '32 as we originally intended; it would have saved a considerable number of
headaches. The incorporating organization charter was
secured by the law firm of Cadwallader, Wickersham and Taft
of New York City. The incorporation of Technocracy had
nothing to do with any attempt on the part of any group to
take over Technocracy or to use your own words, ``compete
with Technocracy.'' A meeting was held in the Hotel Morrison
in Chicago, Illinois, in the last part of June, 1933; this
was prior to our break, so-called, with Columbia University.
There were, at the time of the Chicago meeting, over 20
different organizations of technocracy on the map, from a
duly incorporated political party in the state of Illinois,
to an Institute of Technocracy in California, and various
other organizations; also included in so-called ``Technocracy'' were organizations from New York, Minneapolis, and the
All-American Technological Congress of Chicago, to name but
a few. There were several magazines and newspapers being
published without any authorization or connection with us
whatsoever. Gernsbeck in New York; one in color, printed in
Minneapolis; the ``Technocracy'' of Obispo Beach in California, and many others. The competition which you speak of
began with the burst of publicity in 1932, but the competition did not become politically organized until some time
later. That is a whole story in itself. The amount of
material that one has to wade through to document it is
beyond the time at my disposal in writing to you at this
moment.
<P>
In question #3 you ask, ``How does the prediction of the
collapse of capitalism compare with that of Marx?''
<P>
Technocracy never had any philosophical predictions on the
inevitable collapse of capitalism. The Marxian political
philosophy was a condemnation of the ills of so-called
capitalist society and a propaganda political document that
all wealth was created by work, labor and toil, a theme
which he sums up in his ``Workers of the World Unite.'' Marx,
of course, envisaged abolition of one estate and the
creation of another, and that the capitalist class should be
expropriated and the workers be installed as the new social
elite in a socialist world. Technocracy Inc. has never held
any brief for the so-called ``capitalist class,'' or for that
matter for any proprietary interest or group in our social
structure.Marx only wanted to eliminate the so-called
exploiting and owning classes. We contend that it is hardly
worth undertaking. What Technocracy has always contended is
that if sufficient energy consuming devices are installed
and the total amount of extraneous energy consumed per
capita reaches or exceeds 200,000 kilogram calories per
capita per day, toil and workers alike will be eliminated,
and, when toil is eliminated, the bourgeoisie will likewise
go down the drain of history. Technocracy has always
contended that Marxian political philosophy and Marxian
economics were never sufficiently radical or revolutionary
to handle the problems brought on by the impact of
technology in a large size national society of today. It is
sufficiently revolutionary to be of some importance and
temporary application to under-developed areas of the globe.
We have always contended that Marxian communism, so far as
this Continent is concerned, is so far to the right that it
is bourgeois. It is well here to bear in mind, the technological progression of the next 30 minutes invalidates all
the social wisdom of previous history. Technology has no
ancestors in the social history of man. It creates its own.
<P>
We could give you the energy calculations in many examples,
but that takes paper and time. A simple one in agriculture:
In order to handle the food production where the costs are
lowered and to where the speed is so great that it becomes
applicable to large scale production, concepts and design
factors go beyond anything that the Russians or Chinese have
ever attempted, because they base their concepts on the
collaboration of human beings and the values of human toil
and hand tools, although they were trying to adapt these
concepts to the introduction of mechanical means. Neither
Russia nor China has as yet developed the design to handle
even the production of wheat in their area, let alone other
commodities. The knowledge is here; and it has been done,
their design factors have been proven. It requires more
energy per minute than has ever been employed in the
cultivation of the soil anywhere in the world in history,
and even without further development, one unit now in
existence plants and fertilizes 70 acres of wheat per hour.
You cannot do it with human beings on the land. You have to
move the human being off the land to make way for powerful
equipment which is not yet in quantity production any place
on the globe.
<P>
In question #8, you state there were some reports that
Technocracy had in mind the use of physical force (Chicago,
1933) to accomplish their goal. We know of no such meeting
in April of 1933 in Chicago. It did not exist. There has
never been any statement from Technocracy that force ever
was contemplated. We have stated at the very beginning we
would never ask the public of this Continent to engage in
either ballots or bullets. That has always been our basic
proposition. Technocracy Inc. is not a political party; it
does not run candidates for political office, nor does it
accept for membership any one who is a member or officer of
any political party, right, left or center. Voting is not
construed as membership in a political party. Technocracy
Inc. is in the nature of a membership organization, of
social consultants; its basic concepts and design are really
an attempt to found a science of geo-mechanics, a science of
how to operate large areas of this earth's surface, beneath
and above. United States has in excess of 12 billion h.p.
of installed prime movers in use today. Only seven percent
of that 12 billion are in use in all manufacturing, mining,
railroading, and central stations. Approximately 93 percent
are in automotive vehicles. If the amount of percentage of
prime movers in use in all production and physical
distribution were doubled, there would be 20 million adult
human beings in United States who would no longer be
required in the production and distribution of so-called
physical wealth in these United States. It wasn't Marxian
communism that stopped the advance of the fascist armies of
western Europe in Russia from 1941 to 1945 -- it was the
application of modern technology to their productivity and
military equipment. They lost 10 years in their doctrinaire
schismatic conflicts within their party and their
administration. If they had had the advantage of 10 years
of planned technology, one could only contemplate that their
technology would have been so effective that there would
have been no fascist residue left to stir up further
conflicts in all of Western Europe.
<P>
Understand, human toil and hand tools, from at least
Hammurabi's time (about the 19th Century, B.C.) down to the
present time, the annual increment of physical production,
under human toil and hand tools was so small that it
required a century to amortize the principal and interest of
any major debt. Therefore, without technology, there would
be no possibility of any social renovation, only a
perpetuation of human toil and hand tools. The capital
re-investment rate under human toil and hand tools occurred
once in a century. Today, in the United States we have
technological equipment that, if operated at 75 percent
capacity or more, will amortize out its total indebtedness
in 5 1/4 weeks, thereby rendering possible a capital
re-investment rate of 964 times in a century. Technocracy
Inc. has seen the need for designing the operating system in
any social mechanism of tomorrow when the total number of
energy consuming devices compels the re-orientation of the
entire operating factors of a Continent-wide social system.
To merely expropriate the exploiting and owning classes is
merely a change of legal title and one in this technological
age of unimportance and futility. There is nothing, whether
it is railroads, transportation, highways, power
transmission, continental hydrology, pollution, soil
erosion, sewage, machines for living -- there is not a
single design proposition today that would have validity
tomorrow. There is no sense taking over the ownership of
such obsolescence; you would be compelled to operate the
obsolescent antiquity under the same losses, the same
headaches and same defeats as they do today. It is only
when the load factors of operations and complete design are
altered according to energy factors that a resultant comes
about which would be beyond the dreams of all social
philosophers, one wherein the planned operation of the whole
is many times greater than the sum of its parts.
<P>
Technocracy, not being a political party nor a
conspiratorial body, has never had any intention nor any
wish to assume power, political power that is, in this Price
System. We have never had and never will have any theory of
assumption of political power. After all, the consulting
engineers that design the great suspension bridges, or any
other work, do not make the working drawings, nor do they
fabricate any of the materials. The design materials are
fabricated by different organizations or erecting companies,
who erect the structure. But the orders today are given by
the fiat power and economic power of the political state and
its dominant interests.
<P>
Technocracy has proposed the design of almost every
component of a large scale social system. True, it would
require a technological orchestration of all physical
operating factors, but a technological socialization is far
more reaching, more drastic and more pervasive than anything
that Marx or any socialist ever thought of. So, as you
continue in your study of Technocracy, you will find that it
is incorrect to view us as being in any way analogous to any
party or political philosophy, or to any agitators of social
change for any reason whatsoever. We have never advocated
social change. We have pointed out the factors that would
create it and have come pretty close to predicting its
arrival, but that is an entirely different thing than
advocating social change per se, for social change's sake.
You will find it extremely difficult to change from
sociologic and economic thinking to one of Technocracy; it
is well to realize here and now that Technocracy, like
science, has no truth; truth is a philosophic absolute,
while in Technocracy all things are relative. We are
concerned with the consumption and control of energy and the
energy consuming devices and their resultant production and
consumption, which are all measurable, and have nothing
whatsoever to do with truth or philosophic values.
<P>
You will find that all the values that you or any other
person have acquired regarding culture, art and the
humanities, may be interesting to talk about, but have
little use in designing any comprehensive system of tomorrow
that can be controlled; we are not talking now of police
control -- we are talking of technological control; nor do
we mean regulation. Regulation, of course, comes in after
the origination, after something is started, but control
comes in at the beginning or origination.
<P>
The subjective entities of personal living are undoubtedly
better in the United States of 1964 than they are in many
parts of the world and, of course, much better than they
were 64 years ago. It is always interesting to be able to
engage in interminable- discussions regarding this, but the
problems that United States faces have been cumulative and
are no longer soluble by the considered opinion of
conscientious, right thinking people. The considerations of
yesterday regarding the conduct of human affairs dealt with,
primarily, the regulation or coercion of the behavior of
human beings so as to promote a stable society of their
time. Therefore, all social systems of the past have been
governments of men over men, of laws (not physical laws --
legal) for preferred exploitation of human beings and the
national resources of their area.
<P>
With the technological application of physical science
involving ever-increasing energy consuming devices and
technological equipment, the system of tomorrow will be a
system of operation and control of energy and things,
wherein decisions will have to be rendered as the closest
approximation of the next most probable energy state, made
at the speed of energy transmission and not awaiting the
deliberation of one good man and true, or a thousand. Their
deliberations would take too long, and the mechanism would
be out of control. This is being ironically brought home
every day in the corporate world of the present, especially
those that install the latest computers. Computers can
solve practically all of the problems of the corporate
entity, except the most urgent one, that of finding someone
who can ask the computer an intelligent question that
involves direction and design.

<P>
Dear Mr. Scott:
<P>
I very much appreciate your letter of May 15, 1964. It was
very kind of you to take the time away from your duties to
answer a very long and detailed series of questions. It is
too bad that I cannot get back east or that you will not be
making a continental tour into the Pacific Northwest states
so that we might sit down and talk about this, exchanging
ideas in such a way that I could get a better idea of what
you have in mind.
<P>
There are, however, still several questions which remain
unanswered which I was not able to incorporate at the time I
wrote the letter of March 6, 1964. The first question has
to do with the contribution, if any, of William Smythe.
There were several newspaper articles or short announcements
which alluded to Smythe's origination of the word
``Technocracy.'' This was found in three articles in
Industrial Management. The first was ``Human Instincts in
Reconstruction,'' in February of 1919. The second,
``Technocracy., National Industrial Management,'' March 1919;
and thirdly, ``Technocracy, Ways and Means to Gain Industrial
Democracy, May 19l9. Did Smythe contribute in any way to
the thought of what was later to be Technocracy, Inc.?
<P>
In one of several book reviews on Harold Loeb's Life in a
Technocracy a reviewer suggested that it was a pale Looking
Backward. This is the important justification for raising
the question: Did you feel at the time that Harold Loeb's
book in any way represented the possible vision of how life
in a Technocracy might be and would become?
<P>
The third question is in part the response to your answer to
question number two on page four with regards to Veblen. If
Veblen did not influence your thought, do you think that you
influenced Veblen's thoughts and the articles which appeared
in Dial magazine?
<P>
Fourthly: Was Technocracy incorporated in the State of New
York?
<P>
The fifth question, in reference to the earlier question
number eight in my letter of March 6 and answered on page
eight of your letter, is in regard to the use of physical
force. I mentioned Chicago 1933 in April of that year. I
was mistaken on the date. It was June of 1933 and it was
during the Continental Convention on Technocracy. You were
quoted as saying, ``Technocracy would gain its end by use of
force and bayonets.''
<P>
Another factor which has struck me as being of some
consequence has been the similarity between the organization
chart of the Technate and the Wobbly Wheel. I also notice
that in a pamphlet put out by the All America Technological
Society in 1933 that their organizational structure would
fit somewhere between the two. Would you care to comment on
this?
<P>
A seventh question, which seems to me to be quite important,
was the one having to do with whether you influenced FDR at
all during World War II. And here I have in mind the ads
which appeared in a number of newspapers and apparently over
the radio calling upon FDR to appoint you Director General
of Defense.I would like to restate question number twelve,
March 6. I ran into the suggestion that your distribution
system was somewhat like the Army. Would you comment on
this? This is of primary importance to me because of the
question of value in a distribution system.
<P>
I have been unable to find any thesis or books done on
Technocracy which would take an objective position with
respect to its contribution, its theory, and so on, from an
outsiders viewpoint. That is to say, most all of the
contributions have been either for or against rather than
taking a neutral middle stand in a scientific objective way.
Do you have any such information which might aid me in my
endeavors to research this particular problem? It does seem
that something like this should have been done earlier and
as a consequence I would like very much to have access to
such information if it is available.
<P>
Question nine: Were there any members of Technocracy Inc.,
who moved from the IWW into Technocracy from the latter part
of 1932 until the early 40's. Did any Wobblies find any
satisfaction in the Technocratic Movement? I have in mind
Ben H. Williams. I am not sure he is the same Ben Williams
who was active in the IWW but I do know that there was a man
called Ben H. Williams in both movements. Would you care to
comment on this and would there be any other people who
might be involved in both movements.
<P>
Question ten: While I don't really feel that a membership in
and of itself either lends support to an argument or to an
idea I would like to include something about membership
figures if you feel free to release them. Historically is
my primary concern. If you don't feel that you want to
bring it up to date that is fine, but I would like to have
some idea of the membership from 1932 until 1940 or 1945 if
you are so inclined.

Dear Mr. Faulkner:
<P>
Your letter of August 17 landed in here in the midst of one
of our busiest periods. During August and September we have
a considerable number of visitors every year to CHQ, those
on vacation with time available and on the long holiday
weekend of Labor Day. CHQ had over 30 guests over the
holiday weekend. To house and feed that number, additional
to the Staff, is of course, somewhat of a project in itself.
<P>
In your letter of August 17, 1964, you state that your first
question ``has to do with the contribution, if any, of
William Smythe.'' There were several newspaper articles or
short announcements which alluded to Smythe's origination of
the word, ``Technocracy.'' This was found in three articles
in Industrial Management. The first was ``Human Instincts in
Reconstruction,'' in February of 1919. The second,
``Technocracy, National Industrial Management,'' March 1919;
and thirdly, ``Technocracy, Ways and Means to Gain Industrial
Democracy,'' May 1919. Did Smythe contribute in any way to
the thought of what was later to be Technocracy Inc.?
<P>
Years ago we did some checking, and we found that the word
``Technocracy'' was not originated as a word either by us or
by William Smythe, but had been used by five other persons
back as far as 1882. But all of the ones who had used
``technocracy,'' including Smythe, had never used it as a
definition and a name of a system of technological design
and operation of a Continent. As far as we know, we never
had any personal contact with William Smythe, nor did we
have any knowledge of his having written articles in which
he used the word until several years later. Our use of the
word came about because we tried to find a word which was
descriptive, and in reviewing the origin of the words
``democracy,'' ``autocracy,'' ``plutocracy,'' we found --
``democracy'' (using the combination of the Greek root word
``demos'') -- the rule of many; ``plutocracy'' -- the rule of
wealth; and ``autocracy'' -- the rule of one; we picked on the
combination of ``technocracy'' to mean the rule of science and
skills. This was our approach, and we were not concerned as
to whether we were the originators of the word, because that
is a common process that can be easily arrived at by any one
who has the knowledge of Greek root words. So far as we
know, Smythe was associated with, if not part of, the
Scientific Management Efficiency Engineers and the Taylor
Society that came out of World War 1. As we had nothing in
common with efficiency engineering and scientific management
we therefore were unconcerned as to how the word was used by
others. We were only concerned with our own use of the
word. After all we were creating an unique idea and we
wanted a name for it, and ``Technocracy'' was the name we
decided upon. Our decision was not influenced by any of the
writers of the time. We were too busy formulating the
principles of design and the mathematics of area energy
operations to have much time left to be concerned with
anything else.
<P>
In the third paragraph of your letter of August 17, you
state, ``In one of several book reviews on Harold Loeb's Life
in a Technocracy a reviewer suggested that it was a pale
Looking Backward.'' You ask the question, ``Did you feel at
the time that Harold Loeb's book in any way represented the
possible vision of how life in a Technocracy might be and
would become?''
<P>
Back at the time that Harold Loeb was seeking a publisher
for his book, three publishing firms turned down the
publication because Technocracy refused to approve the
manuscript in any way, shape or form. Harold Loeb was never
a member of Technocracy. He later tried to get in on the
action when he, Felix Fraser and Montgomery Schuyler tried
to start the Continental Committee on Technocracy. They
attended the convention at the Hotel Morrison in June of
1933. They afterward attempted to tour across the United
States to organize a spurious Technocracy. The Roosevelt
administration set up in New York a National Potential
Product Capacity Survey. Harold Loeb, Felix Fraser,
Montgomery Schuyler and others were employed on this federal
project, and therefore had United States federal payroll
numbers. It is well to note here that the Roosevelt
administration in giving birth to the New Deal did its best
to grace the arrival of its new political child and vest it
with a semblance of social vision, by drawing into the
administration every erstwhile Technocrat or one-time
associate of mine. The list is a long one -- Leon Henderson
was made Federal Price Administrator. Leland Olds was made
Federal Power Administrator. Otto Byers was made Deputy
Administrator of the ODT (Office of Defense Transportation)
of the United States. Otto Byers was a professional
engineer in the employ of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad.
He and Stuart Chase were the chief researchers of the
Technical Alliance, in doing the report,submitted by the
Technical Alliance to the operating Railroad Brotherhoods of
United States. Dr. Richard T. Tolman was made Atomic
Representative of the Combined Chiefs of Staff of United
States and Great Britain. Stuart Chase, Bassett Jones,
Frederick Ackerman, Harold Loeb, Felix Fraser, Montgomery
Schuyler, Dal Hitchcock and many others were all on the
federal payroll of the Roosevelt Administration. John
Carmody was head of Rural Electrification and later of the
Maritime Commission, and last but not least, in charge of
distribution of funds in Europe of the EAC, the European
Advisory Commission, in the distribution of Marshall Plan
Funds.
<P>
There are many others, but it would take too long to
enumerate them all and their various positions. Harold Loeb
was only one of a number who attempted to jump into the
parade and cash in on it, whether for monetary reasons or
reasons of prestige, we do not know, and we do not care.
But he was only one of a thousand or more who attempted to
effect a similar attachment to Technocracy. His book is a
piece of imaginary fiction and the kindest thing we can say
is that Bellamy did far, far better many years ago, but both
Looking Backward and Loeb's Life in a Technocracy have
nowhere in their pages the modulus and calculus of the
design of an operating technological mechanism for the
Continent of North America.
<P>
The third question of the first page of your letter of
August 17 is ``if Veblen did not influence your thought, do
you think that you influenced Veblen's thoughts and the
articles which appeared in the Dial Magazine?'' I first met
Thorstein Veblen in the early fall of 1918 at the old
Faculty Club of Columbia University. I was introduced to
him and to half a dozen others by Montgomery Schuyler, and
Merrill Rogers who was advertising manager of the Dial
Magazine at the time. As a result of the first meeting with
Veblen, Dr. Horace Kellen, Dr. Wesley C. Mitchell, Dr.
Johnson (later to head the New School for Social Research),
Dr. James Harvey Robinson, Miller and others, it was
proposed that a series of seminar dinners be held in which
Veblen would undertake to bring the economists and
sociologists, if I would make a similar undertaking to bring
a number of scientists, technologists and engineers. A
number of these dinners were held at the Columbia University
Club on West 43rd and other places in New York. They were
quite interesting at that time. Dr. Robinson used to sit
over in the corner and make notes, and he wrote his book
``The Mind in the Making'' from notes taken at those dinner
seminars. Veblen and a small group, mostly economists
associated with him, were trying to write articles on the
American social structure when we came along and introduced
our concepts of technology and energy determinants.
<P>
Veblen wrote a series of articles for the Dial Magazine.
They were later incorporated and printed as a book under the
title of ``Engineers and the Price System.'' The Price
System, as you may be aware, was Technocracy's term and not
Veblen's. The last article (both in the Dial and then later
in the book Veblen called ``Memorandum on a Practicable
Soviet of Technicians'') we disagreed with, because our
analysis contended that social change on this Continent
would take an entirely different pattern and would not be
analogous to the development in any other part of the world.
It would be peculiar and endemic to the technological
development of this Continent.
<P>
Our association with Veblen and his dry sense of humor was
rewarding, but at the same time it was slightly
disappointing, chiefly because he didn't have the energy nor
the initiative, due to ill health, to entertain a great
departure from his academic background. These remarks are
not to be construed as indicating that there had been a
personal break with Thorstein Veblen; there was not. The
New School for Social Research got underway in a few rooms
in one of the old set-back buildings on West 23rd St., now
occupied by the giant apartment buildings of London Terrace.
<P>
Mrs. Dorothy Whitney's donations to the New School for
Social Research were really a subsidy to pay Thorstein
Veblen an income as faculty member of this organization.
<P>
Thorstein Veblen, in a meeting in my apartment in New York
City, said I was the only one that had kept him up until
3:30 in the morning. The group around Veblen became
frightened about the ideas and social implications of
Technocracy, back then, in 1919; they were frightened
because in their eyes it became too revolutionary, and they
drifted toward the liberalism that is now a prime exhibit of
the New School for Social Research and other accredited
educational institutions. In 1919-1920, Mrs. Agnes Delima
was my stenographer and secretary in the Technical Alliance.
She later became the secretary for the corporation of the
New School for Social Research, a board member.
<P>
The last several articles of the Dial Magazine were
undoubtedly written by Veblen because of the contact of the
Veblen group with the Technical Alliance. They were
attempting to ride what they thought might be ``the wave of
the future'' and Veblen in the last few articles in the Dial
was undoubtedly going along to some extent with the master
minding of one Ardzrooni. He was one of the famous
Ardzrooni brothers, raisin kings of California, who was
engaged in acquiring a university degree late in life and
was undoubtedly magnanimous in his considerations in
furthering special educational projects and was in those
early days associated with the Veblen group. And so it
turns out that there are even raisins in the pie.
<P>
Your fourth question, ``Was Technocracy incorporated in the
State of New York?'' Yes, it was. Our attorneys who secured
the incorporation were Cadwallader, Wickersham and Taft.
<P>
The fifth question, also on page one of your letter of
August 17, ``in regard to the use of physical force,'' you
stated, ``it was June of 1933 and it was during the
Continental Convention on Technocracy. You were quoted as
saying, `Technocracy would gain its end by use of force and
bayonets.'
<P>
As we stated in other communications, no such statement has
ever been made by me nor by Technocracy Inc. Our original
declaration at that convention, and which since has been
printed in our literature far and wide, was ``that
Technocracy would never ask the public of these United
States and Canada to indulge in either ballots or bullets.''
Quite a different statement from what you claim I was quoted
as saying.
<P>
On page two of your letter of August 17, you state ``another
factor which has struck me as being of some consequence has
been the similarity between the organization chart of the
Technate and the Wobbly Wheel. I also notice that in a
pamphlet put out by the All America Technological Society in
1933 that their organizational structure would fit somewhere
between the two. Would you care to comment on this?''
<P>
We do not see any resemblance, as the Organizational Chart
stretches across the wall of a good sized building, and is
capable of extension and expansion. We never had any Wobbly
Wheel at the time we drew the schematic organization of a
Technate. We see no resemblance whatsoever.
<P>
After all, Technocracy was not responsible for the formation
of the All American Technological Society in 1933. This
organization was dreamed up by General Wood, head of Sears
Roebuck, Major General Westervelt, vice president of Sears
Roebuck, in charge of production, Blythe and Co., whom you
might call the Stone-Webster of the middle west, and Mail of
the Mall Tool. Leaving out Major General Westervelt, they
were a pretty reactionary crowd. That was the organization
that secured swank offices on the mezzanine floor of the
Morrison Hotel, with secretaries and stenographers and hired
the editor of a Chicago newspaper to be publicity director.
The All American Technological Society was only one of
almost 30 organizations in the United States that came into
being from Mobile, Alabama, and Los Angeles, Calif.,
Seattle, Minneapolis, Chicago, New York and other cities,
all trying to climb aboard the band wagon. There was even a
wealthy doctor who incorporated the Technocracy Political
Party in the state of Illinois, and had sound trucks out
blaring the good news to the citizens of that state. There
was a slew of publications, some on simple newsprint, and up
to magazines printed with photographs in color, none of
which originated with Technocracy Inc. and none of which had
the approval of or sponsorship of Technocracy Inc. Seldom
has there been assembled, as there was in the ballroom of
the Morrison Hotel, such a ludicrous assemblage of so many
different kinds of fish, all trying to nibble at the same
bait. Technocracy did not bury them, they buried
themselves. Technocracy would have loved to have had the
money spent by the All American Technological Society and
others in promoting the so-called convention on Technocracy
in 1933 at the Hotel Morrison in Chicago, Illinois. We
could have put it to better use.
<P>
The seventh Question. ``......... which seems to me to be
quite important was the one having to do with whether you
influenced FDR at all during World War II. And here I have
in mind the ads which appeared in a number of newspapers and
apparently over the radio calling upon FDR to appoint you
Director General of Defense. I would like to restate question number
twelve, March 6. 1 ran into the suggestion that
your distribution system was somewhat like the Army. Would
you comment on this? This is of primary importance to me
because of the question of value in a distribution system.''
<P>
There were a few ads placed asking for my appointment, that
FDR appoint me as Director General of Defense. These ads
were due to over-enthusiasm and exuberance of members of
Technocracy on the Pacific Coast. You do not mention the
fact that there was a great campaign of Total Conscription
advertisements placed in every major daily from the Atlantic
to the Pacific coast, in Canada and United States, full page
advertisements for Total Conscription of Men, Machines,
Materiel and Money; also, hundreds of leaflets were printed
and programs were put on radio in most of the major cities,
from the Atlantic to the Pacific, not once but a number of
times. The number of copies of ads printed by the full page
in newspapers alone exceeded 14,000,000 copies. It was
endorsed and approved by labor unions and other
organizations in various parts of the country. The largest
single local union of UAW, in Detroit, approved the Total
Conscription program unanimously, 20,000 or so members. The
advertisements on the Director General of Defense were
peanuts, were insignificant and were stopped by order of CHQ
of Technocracy Inc. The full page advertisement on Total
Conscription was written by myself. It is amazing, if you
wish to go into something that has an interesting
sociological impact. You might investigate the Technocracy
Program of Total Conscription further, you might find it
significant. Technocracy's program of Total Conscription
was first made public at the Western Conference of
Municipalities at Yorktown, Saskatchewan, June 1st to 4th,
1940. It was this program that resulted in action
subsequently taken by the Minister of Justice, the Honorable
Ernest LaPointe of Canada, when 16 days after the Yorktown
release the Order in Council was issued and tabled declaring
Technocracy banned because we were inimical to the conduct
of the war. Strange paradox, isn't it? The Honorable
MacKenzie King agreed in a pre-election Liberal Party
caucus, and promised the Roman Catholic, French Canadian,
Quebec members that conscription would not be introduced nor
considered by the MacKenzie King Government of the Dominion
of Canada. Therefore, the Quebec group forced MacKenzie
King into accepting a ban upon an organization which wasn't
of his own motivation, and it is highly amusing that the
Honorable MacKenzie King, Prime Minister of Canada, in the
midst of the war, on October 12, 1943, unconditionally
lifted the ban on Technocracy and re-instated the
organization to its previous status, without any limiting
restrictions.
<P>
One of the most vociferous attacks on Technocracy in Canada,
prior to the Order in Council, was the originally-named
Catholica-Fascista Francais, later known as the
Bloc-Populaire, led by Adrean Arcand. Mayor Houde of
Montreal and Adrean Arcand spent most of the war in a
concentration camp under sentence by the Canadian
Government. Kindly do not confuse my name with one Major
Scott, no relation of mine, who was one of Adrian Arcand's
chief lieutenants.
<P>
After all, Technocracy has never attempted to advise,
influence, persuade or cajole the political leadership of
any country on the North American Continent, nor anywhere
else. We are somewhat amused by Franklin Delano Roosevelt's
placement in high position of 18 or more of our ex-members
and associates in his administration. If they in any way
influenced FDR, that was certainly not because of any
direction or initiative on the part of Technocracy; it would
be more likely solicitation on the part of the erstwhile
members for the political future of Franklin Delano
Roosevelt and their own enhancement.
<P>
Your question nine states: ``Were there any members of
Technocracy Inc. who moved from the IWW into Technocracy
from the latter part of 1932 until the early 40's. Did any
Wobblies find any satisfaction in the Technocratic Movement?
I have in mind Ben H. Williams. I am not sure he is the
same Ben Williams who was active in the IWW, but I do know
that there was a man called Ben H. Willians in both
movements. Would you care to comment on this and would
there be any other people who might be involved in both
movements. ''
<P>
There were only two members of Technocracy who had been
associated with the IWW. They did not move from the IWW
into Technocracy. They merely happened to be in certain
geographical locations and they moved and joined Sections of
Technocracy, not in the same area, but considerable distance
apart. We had no knowledge of them, or their past
association, nor had ever heard of them prior to their
joining Technocracy. One was the Ben Williams which you
mentioned in your question nine. Both of these members were
dismissed from Technocracy for conduct unbecoming a
Technocrat. As to the question of whether any Wobbly found
satisfaction in the Technocratic movement, if they did they
would not have been dismissed from Technocracy. Technocracy
is the antithesis of the program and philosophy of the
Industrial Workers of the World. It never has had anything
in common, and any member of any organization that joined
Technocracy we were willing to accept as members provided
they were citizens of the United States and were not members
of any political party and had no criminal record, and were
still considered to be legally competent. Over three
thousand members of the Masonic Order have joined
Technocracy over the years, as have over one hundred known
socialists, and an even greater number of pseudo-fascists.
It would be just as pertinent to ask -- did the many Masons
who joined Technocracy find any satisfaction in the
Organization? If they did, they found it as citizens and
Members of Technocracy and not as Masons. Technocracy has
had more trouble getting rid of people than it had in
acquiring new members. Many of our officers and Members
have joined Technocracy with the avowed purpose of proving
Technocracy incorrect, and, over the years, they have
signally failed to achieve their original purpose and became
some of our most loyal and dedicated Members.
<P>
We have no knowledge of any other people who might be
involved in both movements with the exception of one, Ralph
Chaplin. Ralph Chaplin visited me in my apartment, if I
remember correctly, sometime in September, 1919. Ralph
Chaplin was a member of the IWW and was poet, writer and
editor of their publication. In 1948 Ralph Chaplin had
completed a book entitled, ``Wobbly -- the Rough-and-Tumble
Story of an American Radical,'' a book made possible by the
grant of the Newbury Fellowship in Midwestern Studies by the
Newbury Library to Ralph Chaplin. The book is 435 pages in
length. On page 295 he mentions, ``Not the least interesting
person I met on my trip was Howard Scott............. We
discussed at length Thorstein Veblen's 'Soviet of Engineers'
and its relation to the 'Industrial Commonwealth,' basic in
the I.W.W. credo. Howard Scott and I spent an entire
evening at his Greenwich Village studio apartment discussing
the proposed 'Industrial Encyclopedia,' which the Wobblies
had dreamed up in Cook County Jail.' ...........
<P>
This is very interesting, in that Ralph Chaplin in writing a
book of this kind, wishes to give credence and importance to
his position and the doctrines of the IWW. We did not spend
more than a few minutes on the IWW credo or the ``Soviet of
Engineers'' or the ``Industrial Encyclopedia.'' Very little
time was taken in that. On page 296 he states: ``All the
time he was discoursing so plausibly about teardrop
automobiles, flying wing airplanes, and technological
unemployment, I was looking at the other side of the studio
where an appalling phallic watercolor painting was displayed
among blueprints and graphs on a big easel. Evidently the
'Great Scott' was a man of diversified interests.'' Once
again, this is quite interesting. I never had a painting,
phallic or otherwise, and if I had had a painting I
certainly would not mix it up with blue prints and
mathematical charts. On the same page (296), the last
sentence of the second paragraph, he states: ``All this was
done before Howard Scott came to Chicago to direct the
I.W.W.'s short-lived Research Department.'' This again is
very interesting, because we had our Technical Alliance in
operation in the city of New York and never went to Chicago
to direct the IWW's short lived Research Department, or
anything else in the city of Chicago.
<P>
Further on in the same volume, on page 359, he states:
``When Technocracy swept the country as a possible panacea, I
supported it editorially. I even helped to organize Howard
Scott's 'Technological Congress' during Chicago's Worlds
Fair. But, at the same time, I was concentrating on the
technique of a general strike which would enable labor to
defend itself against inevitable civil war and armed
insurrection. This program, I thought, would make it
possible for the workers of America to defeat not only
capitalism but any Communist, Fascist, or Nazi substitute
that might be offered. Howard Scott wasn't very
enthusiastic about the general strike idea. He was wearing
a well-tailored gray suit now with a monad in the
buttonhole, and all the technocrats were saluting him in
public.'' This is another statement of Ralph Chaplin's that
has no basis whatsoever in substance nor in fact. Neither
Howard Scott nor the Technocrats organized the Technological
Congress in Chicago at the Morrison Hotel. This Congress
was organized by and publicized by the All American
Technological Society which had no relationship to
Technocracy whatsoever.
<P>
Ralph Chaplin, while he never joined Technocracy, at that
time and slightly later, gave it an apparently sincere and
honest support.But we must point out that I did not wear a
gray suit, nor did the Technocrats wear gray suits in 1933,
1934, and 1936.1 wore a blue suit in all those years.  We
have the data and the photographs to prove it. No doubt
this kind of statement probably comes from the
``quarterbacking'' which the intellectuals of the University
of Chicago supplied him with.
<P>
So far as Technocracy is concerned, our contact with Ralph
Chaplin in 1919 was renewed 14 years later, and Ralph
Chaplin, with all the enthusiasm and vigor that he had at
his command regarding Technocracy, never joined the
Organization. He got into difficulties at a couple of
meetings and we lost contact with him completely.
<P>
In 1934 we published the pamphlet, ``Science versus Chaos,''
which is substantially an address by me before the national
Technological Congress and Continental Convention on
Technocracy at Hotel Morrison, June, 1933. This pamphlet
was first published by the thousands in Chicago, and it was
the first piece of literature that I had to take with me on
the first Continental tour in 1934. Ralph Chaplin did a
beautiful job in writing a foreward, an introduction, to the
said pamphlet, which we hereby quote in full:
<P>
<blockquote>
<h4>SOMETHING NEW UNDER THE SUN</h4>
<P>
Technocracy -- new, startling, fundamental -- has
invaded the minds of North Americans with unparalleled
positiveness and force.
<P>
Its original research summary, a simple statement of
facts about the critical period in which we find ourselves,
startled the world. The questions it posed still remain
unanswered.
<P>
Technocracy not only made the American people `fact
conscious,' but confronted the entire Continent with the
inevitability of fundamental social change.
<P>
Technocracy's position is based on facts, not rhetoric.
Its message has cut deep. It has reached more intelligent
and functionally important citizens in all walks of life
than any other organization, and continues to do so.
<P>
Technocracy's scientific approach to the social problem
is unique, and its method is completely new. It speaks the
language of science, and recognizes no authority but the
facts.
<P>
in Technocracy we see science banishing waste,
unemployment, hunger, and insecurity of income forever.
<P>
in Technocracy we see science replacing an economy of
scarcity with an era of abundance.
<P>
In Technocracy we see functional competence displacing
grotesque and wasteful incompetence, facts displacing
guesswork, order displacing disorder, industrial planning
displacing industrial chaos.
<P>
Technocracy is the extension of science to build a
civilization worthy of the intelligence of man.
<P>
Technocracy concerns itself with the Continental area of
North America alone. Technocracy marks a turning point in
American history -- the birth of a greater America.
Technocracy contains all the elements out of which great
movements are made.
<P>
Howard Scott, founder and Director-in-Chief of
Technocracy Inc. presents in the following pages a diagnosis
of the existing disorder and an outline of a New America.
</blockquote>
<P>
It is interesting to note that Ralph Chaplin never mentioned
this, as an enthusiastic approval of Technocracy, at any
time in his volume. He wrote this eulogistic approval of
Technocracy 14 years after the first meeting, and 15 years
after that he writes a book. In that long 15 years,
Technocracy had not had any contact with him and had never
heard from him. The Organization had been in existence, and
Ralph Chaplin could very easily have contacted us, but
apparently it was his privilege not to do so. We were
uninformed and unaware of either his manuscript or his book
until years after its publication. We regret the bias and
the incorrect emphasis and errors in his statements made in
the book ``Wobbly,'' by Ralph Chaplin. They are incorrect in
substance and in fact.
<P>
You seem to be laboring under the misapprehension that there
is some connection with other organizations of the United
States and more specifically, the IWW. Neither the
Technical Alliance nor Technocracy Inc. nor any of its
original members were ever associated with any political
party or organization, Republican, Democratic, conservative,
liberal, Socialist, Communist or Fascist organizations, nor
any labor organizations, including the IWW, the Industrial
Workers of the World. The technological concepts of
Technocracy are completely beyond any of the political and
social philosophies, from Adam Smith, Ricardo, Proudhon,
Bakunin, Karl Marx, Lenin and various other promulgators of
rightist and leftist political philosophies. Technocracy
Inc. never had any illusions about the operating physical
structure of the social system on the North American
Continent. We never had time nor the emotional bias to
engage in psychopathic hostilities toward the capitalists,
the landed gentry nor the bourgeoisie. Neither were we
antipathetic nor hostile to any labor or radical movements.
As far as Technocracy was concerned, both attitudes of the
so-called radical left and reactionary right were all alike,
mere misadventures in the hostilities of the oncoming social
conflict. Technocracy never was for the workers against the
capitalists, nor for the capitalists against the workers.
To us, Karl Marx's slogan, ``Workers of the world unite, you
have nothing to lose but your chains,'' was an ironic bad
joke, as despicable as the capitalists' slogan that ``free
enterprise can provide the best of all possible worlds.''
<P>
As the technological design for the operation of a Continent
would eliminate human toil, and the ``worker'' would become as
extinct as the Dodo bird, it axiomatically follows that as
any Continental social system eliminates toil and the
``worker,'' all of the other proprietary rights and
proprietors will join the ``workers'' in the limbo of the
forgotten past, because when toil and the workers are
disposed of, the bourgeoisie become extinct. All of the
political philosophies from Leninist-Marxism of the left to
the European Catholic-Fascism of the right extoll the
corporate structure and attempt to distribute land to the
peasants and freeze agricultural workers to the soil.
<P>
Modern technology never got anywhere as its beginnings in
the industrial revolution were meager and blockaded by the
limiting concepts of those who introduced machine processes
as adjuncts to human labor in the acquisition of greater
profits. Under human toil and hand tools, the annual
increment of production was so low each year that a major
investment required a century for the amortization of
principal and interest; or to state it another way, the
re-investment of capital in capital goods could occur
approximately once in a century. Private enterprise in
these United States and elsewhere today are demanding that
the technologists and engineers design equipment and
continuous processes capable of amortizing out the interest
and principal in a much shorter time. They do not realize
it, but what they actually are doing is selling their own
system short. It is really ironic that the fastest returns
are obtained of capital goods by those investments which
install the latest in modern technology. We have today in
the United States equipment which, if operated at 75% or
more of capacity, will amortize out the millions of dollars
of investment in 5 1/4 weeks. This is a capital
re-investment rate of around 960 times in a century instead
of one. The question here to ask is whether Woodrow Wilson,
Franklin Delano Roosevelt, General Eisenhower, Winston
Churchill, Josef Stalin, or John F. Kennedy, -- did any of
them or all of them have the slightest knowledge of the
factors underlying our technological progression? On the
other side of the picture, did Adam Smith, Karl Marx, Sorel,
Lenin, Mao Tse Tung -- were they capable of operating in
this field of knowledge? The answer is that both
collections of persons, the so-called political philosophers
and political governing heads of the last 60 years, have
possessed no fundamental knowledge of the economies they
were attempting to manage or to philosophically analyze.
Not one of the array of figures on the international scene
has had sufficient knowledge of the modulus and calculus of
design to build an efficient privy on wheels. The situation
in this respect might be amusing if it weren't so pathetic.
The Russians wasted 15 years of their national energies in
the schismatic doctrinaire battles between those who spent
their time advocating world revolution and those who wanted
to interpret Marx for Russia and the Russians. If the
Russians had been able to orientate their technology 10 or
12 years before they did, the fascist armies of Europe would
have been defeated at the Russian borders, and it would have
been Western Europe that would have been devastated.
<P>
In Europe, World War I disintegrated dynasties and empires.
Violence and chicanery took over. The Cordon Sanitaire
backed by all the reactionary forces of Europe, political
and ecclesiastic, were about to nurture the soil for
fascism. Western European fascism originated in Europe in
1919, and fascism had its movements in practically every
country west of Russia. Benito Mussolini in Italy and Adolf
Hitler did not create fascism; they were created by it, and
the result was that you had the Sinarquista in Portugal, the
Falangista in Spain, the Croix de Feu and Cagoulard in
Belgium and France, the Stahlhelm in Austria, the Knights of
St. Michael and the Iron Guard in Roumania, Fascists in
Italy, Ustachl in Yugoslavia, the Arrow-Close of Hungary and
the Nazis in Germany. There were similar developments in
Poland, Norway, Lithuania and elsewhere. United States
revived Germany after World War I with the Young Plan and
the Dawes Plan and other assistance. After World War 11,
United States poured billions into Europe under the Marshall
Plan. Since the war, the figures reported that
$104,000,000,000 have been spent abroad by the United
States. Our policies have revived private enterprise and
upheld reactionary regimes but they haven't solved any
physical problems of any part of the world nor solved our
physical problems at home. They still remain facing us and
today are greater than ever within history.
<P>
In the early days of the Technical Alliance, we were visited
by all kinds of people, from Americans of the upper levels
of finance and industry to a raft of writers, so called
radicals and leftists. In a sense we technologists and
engineers were somewhat naive at that time, in that any
knowledge that we might have had of any of the movements was
purely cursory and not from intention. All of the movements
and all of the literature had nothing to offer Technocracy.
Technocracy was proposing a technological re-design of the
Continent in a closed-field of operation. We, as an
organization, were not interested in preserving the status
quo, nor were we imbued with any conspiracy to destroy it.
We were not concerned with wasting our time trying to
capture the entire scientific and engineering profession of
this Continent as members. We knew only too well that if
every technologist and engineer designed the equipment of
tomorrow to operate at higher speeds with greater energy
consumption per unit of time, and less energy per unit
produced of products or services, that they did not have to
be Technocrats, that, in their professional way, they were
doing their best to behave as if they were. It is therefore
obvious that none of the political philosophies, right or
left or center, and none of the social movements or labor
organizations had anything to offer Technocracy. In fact
all of them were impedimentia in the pathway toward
tomorrow. They had nothing to give us because we were
involved in an original piece of research in an unique
projection that had never beer% proposed before. These
movements had nothing to give us; they might in some way
attempt to imitate us, to borrow from us, or to block us,
but in the main they made no real attempt to understand
Technocracy's design and social consequences. We received
far greater recognition abroad and more serious study by
scientists, technologists and engineers in other lands.
They even proposed to extend our energy determinants to a
world basis as suggested by the title of one engineering
publication of Czechoslavakia, ``Der Welt Energie.''
Technocracy can be applied to other Continents, but as the
soil, water, climate, geographical conformation and natural
resources differ with each continental area, the social
resultants, while they would be enormously advanced over
anything today, would not be all equal or the same. The
differences would occur because of the differences of the
physical constituents of the continent and their energy
factors. In other words, Technocracy is applicable to any
continental area of the world, but, as stated distinctly,
socially they wouldn't have the same returns, nor would they
all have pink cheeks.
<P>
We regret that the By-Laws and General Regulations of
Technocracy Inc., and the policies in general prevent us
<P>
from giving you any figures on membership of any period of
Technocracy's history. This has always been the policy of
Technocracy. We hope that the preceding will give a
satisfactory response to your questions and enable you to
complete your dissertation in a more extensive way.
<P>
Very truly yours,<br>
TECHNOCRACY INC.
