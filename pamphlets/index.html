<h1>Index of Technocracy Pamphlets</h1>
<p>
This is an index of the pamphlets and such that I have online.
Some of them have been out of print for many years, keep that in mind
when reading them.
For a compleat listing of what is currently available (and how to get them),
check out the <a href="../pubs.html">list of publications</a>.

<ul>
  <li><a href="ecology-of-man.html">The Ecology of Man</a>
      First published in 1948, turned into a pamphlet in 1969 and
      still distributed.
  <li><a href="man-hours-distribution.html">Man-Hours and Distribution</a>
      For those who don't mind a little math, this is
      <a href="../people/m-king-hubbert.html">M. King Hubbert</a>'s
      paper on the relationship between man-hours and production.
      In print from 1940 until the early 50's
  <li><a href="../periodicals/social-trends/149/price-system.html">
      I Am The Price System</a> and <cite>The Culture of Abundance</cite>.
      Circulated from 1945 until the mid 70's.
  <li><a href="history-and-purpose.html">History and Purpose of
      Technocracy</a>
      First published in 1965, turned into a pamphlet in 1984.
  <li><a href="eng-cert.html">The Energy Certificate</a>
      In print since 1938.
  <li><a href="intro.html">Introduction to Technocracy</a>.
      One of the first booklets on Technocracy in early 1933, and was
      kept in print until the early 50's
  <li><a href="mystery-of-money.html">The Mystery of Money</a>.
      Distributed from 1937 to sometime in the 40's.
  <li>The Continental Hydrology will be here soon, but the maps are
      already available: 
      <a href="hydro-big.gif">full-sized map</a> (350K) and
      <a href="hydro-sm.gif">a reduced version</a> (125K)
      (Keep in mind that these maps were drawn up in the 30's
      when there were fewer dams and the ecological effects of
      them were not yet known.  They need to be updated to account
      for these new facts.)
