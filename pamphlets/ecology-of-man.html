Technocracy has always insisted that the type of social operation  
it offers is not just desirable; it is necessary. As we peruse this pamphlet 
we ask ourselves the question, `Can man continue to live at all on this 
Continent without drastically changing his methods of management?'  
<p>
This is not a pleasant pamphlet to read. It will frighten the reader into 
realizing just how close to the edge our plundering Price System has led us, 
and how casually our ignorant political and financial leaders are ignoring 
the facts of life. It is this persistent refusal to face facts that has been 
the cause of all our difficulties as a nation in the past thirty years.

<p>
Ecology is the study of organisms in relation to their environment. Since no 
one organism lives strictly to itself, the study of ecology involves the 
inter-relationships of many organisms as well as the relationships of these 
organisms with the non-organic environment.  
<p>
<h3>`THE WEB OF LIFE'</h3>
<p>
This complex is often spoken of as the `web of life.'  The principal 
components of the environment are plants, animals, minerals and water, with 
other factors of varying importance which we shall omit from our present 
discussion.
<p>
When there is an essential stability in the environment; that is, when 
conditions and relationships do not change much from year to year, we speak 
of it as the `balance of nature.' When there is a stabilized, dynamic balance 
between plants, animals, minerals and water, a particular and interesting 
condition prevails--the return of ingredients to the environment from year to 
year is essentially equal to that which is removed.  
<p>
For example, the plants and animals which die are replaced by similar plants 
and animals. No more water is removed than what accumulates during the year. 
Fertility which is taken from the soil is restored. Under such conditions, 
and excepting a major geological change, the prevailing environment could be 
maintained for an indefinite period of time.  
<p>
The balance of nature is often upset, however. A whole area may be affected 
by a geological change; such as, change of climate (temperature and humidity) 
or change of elevation or topography. A local upset of much smaller magnitude 
occurs when an area is burned over or is invaded by a sand dune or a volcanic 
deposit.  
<p>
Following events which wipe out all, or most of life, a period of 
rehabitation must occur. The first life that comes into an area is called the 
pioneer flora and fauna. The pioneer life is only temporary; it is soon 
replaced by other kinds of life once a suitable environment is prepared for 
them. These in turn are followed by still other forms. Thus, there is a 
succession of life--a series of changes in the organic components of the 
environment, in which transitional species successively come into
prominence, only to fade out of the scene.
<p>
Eventually, a new balance is established which is again stable. The final
association of plants and animals in an ecological succession is known as the
climax association. It tends to be stable for long a period of time.
<p>
We might use a burned over forest area as an example for further 
illustration. In this case, the pioneer species of plants would probably be 
various types of herbs, the kind depending upon the geographical locality, 
the humidity and the elevation. These will not remain long as the dominant 
species, but will soon have that position usurped by other species--probably 
various kinds of shrubs. These will probably be replaced by trees, and these 
first trees by other kinds of trees.  
<p>
Eventually, a climax flora will become established which is permanent. This 
flora, and the fauna which is associated with it, constitute a balanced 
association, not only between the component organisms, but also with the 
water supply and the minerals of that area. However, it may take many years 
for the transitional changes to result in the climax association. But this 
climax association may not be composed of the same types of plants and 
animals as the one that prevailed before the fire. The main thing of 
importance is that the association is in balance and it is able to maintain 
itself in the face of other organic competition for that area. 
<p>
<h3>MAN NOW DOMINANT SPECIES</h3>
<p>
Among the ecological associations of the world, man is now the most dominant 
species of animal, except in a few areas where he has not penetrated in large 
numbers. Although man has been a component part of the world's balance of 
nature, it was not until quite recently in his history that he became a 
disturbing influence to that balance.  Because of his greater innate 
intelligence and his inventiveness, as well as his social organization, man 
was able to tilt the dynamic balance more and more in his favor.  
<p>
The invention of weapons and tools, the use of fire, and the development of 
language (as a means of communication and social memory) gave man a decided 
advantage in the struggle for survival over other animals of comparable or 
even larger size. The domestication of plants and animals and other 
technological developments accelerated this advantage through the centuries, 
until now man has become almost everywhere the most dominant species in the 
environment, if not in numbers at least in the effect which he has produced.  
<p>
During 98 percent of man's 7000 years of civilized existence on the earth, 
this technological progress was so slow that the disturbance of the general 
ecological balance was only of a minor magnitude and only local in its 
effects. But the last two percent of that time--the last 140
years--tells a far different story. During this time, man has become a
plague upon the earth. He has exterminated or exhausted many species
which once roamed the earth, flew the sky, or swam the waters by the
hundreds of millions. He has plowed up the sod and slashed away at the
plant growth, until many areas which were once verdant with forests
and grass are now desolate. The ecological environment in which man as
a species could flourish is now shrinking because of his own careless
behavior.
<p>
Man has also let his population increase to the point where it has become 
self-destructive.  He must not only combat the other elements of the 
environment in order to survive, but he must battle within his own species to 
determine which individuals and which groups are to survive. No matter how 
one tries to rationalize the value of human life, one cannot escape the 
conclusion that there are just too many human beings on the earth.  
<p>
As a result of this overburden of human population, the destruction of 
forests and other organic life which is consumed in the processes of human 
living is in many instances greater than the replacement of the particular 
species involved. Over-grazing of the rangelands in the western United States, 
for example, has so reduced the edible plants and so eroded the soil that the 
rangelands will not support more than a fraction of the live-stock that they 
did fifty or more years ago. The people of North America are cutting off the 
forests faster than they are being replenished. Even certain species of life 
in the ocean are becoming exhausted; not only the great whales, but certain 
species of shellfish and true fishes used for food.  
<p>
<h3>MAN ENDANGERS HIS ENVIRONMENT</h3>
<p>
It is not only these organic factors of the environment that are being 
disturbed by man's recent activities on the earth, but the disturbance 
extends into the inorganic elements as well. Among these is ground water. 
Through millions of years, the rocks of the earth have been saturated with 
water below a certain level. This level is known as the water table. Man has 
disturbed this ground in a great many places. He has instituted drainage to 
remove surplus water from the surface, which has resulted in a lowering of 
the water table. He has destroyed the plant cover in many places and this 
permits a more rapid runoff, hence less water seeps into the ground. He has 
drilled wells and pumped the water out of the ground at a faster rate than it 
is replaced by natural means. He has diverted many lakes, streams and 
underground flows into the water mains of his large cities and then increased 
the population of the cities beyond the capacities of the water to supply 
their needs. Thus, in many areas where there was adequate water to supply a 
moderate population on a long-term basis, there is now a deficiency of water 
because of the uncontrolled increase of the population and the short-sighted 
exploitation of the water resources.  
<p>
Another inorganic factor which man is misusing is the arable soil of the 
earth. It is estimated that about a fourth of the original arable soil area 
of the earth has been ruined, with a large part of the remainder damaged. On 
the basis of the factor of suitable land area alone, there are already 600 
million more people on the earth than the soil can feed with a decent diet. 
But the population is increasing at the rate of more than 20 million a year 
and the acreage of productive soil is declining.  
<p>
But, these are not the most critical factors affecting man's ecological 
balance. During his industrial growth, accompanied by the wasteful practices 
of business exploitation, man has become ravenous in the use of many 
minerals, ranging from iron ore to phosphate fertilizers. A number of the 
most critical of these minerals are nearing the stage of deficiency and some 
are rapidly approaching exhaustion. For example, the United States can no 
longer supply all of its own present consumption of copper, lead, zinc, 
tungsten, manganese, and petroleum. The United States is importing all of 
these to meet its domestic demands.  Iron ore will soon be added to
this list.
<p>
It is of little moment, in the long run, whether the human species on this 
Continent can maintain its present industrial pace for another ten years or 
another hundred. In reviewing the overall picture, we have neglected the 
details which support the general conclusions, but the details are there in  
abundance.  
<p>
The important thing we are attempting here is a long range projection of 
man's ecological trend, especially as it pertains to the North American 
Continent. This much we can say for sure: Man will not be able to live on the 
North American Continent for the next generation as he has lived for the past 
generation. He has been too prodigal with his heritage. This has left him in 
the position of being repudiated by his environment.  
<p>
The people of North America cannot continue, for even a few more years, their 
present magnitude of free enterprise operations. The environment will not 
supply the raw materials for this type of human onslaught for long. What the 
future of the people now living on the Continent will become is something 
fearful to contemplate. Yet, the North American citizen, instead of 
acknowledging the facts and recognizing the trend, is blindly and blatantly 
going ahead to increase the rate of the very factors which are contributing 
most toward the downfall of his vaunted civilization.
<p>
Man under his present mode of operation is not a climax species in the 
environment. He is a transitional species; for he is taking more from the 
environment than is being replaced. He is scheduled, therefore, in the course 
of events to lose his dominant position in the organic association; perhaps, 
to be superseded as the number one species by something else. Whether that 
something is insect, rodent or weed does not much matter to us, once man 
succumbs.  
<p>
The same factors that are pointing in a downward direction here on North 
America also apply to a greater or lesser degree to other parts of the world. 
In summary, they are these: Excessive population; soil erosion and depletion; 
destruction of forests and rangelands; excessive use of ground water; and 
exhaustion of vital mineral deposits.
<p>
To the student of trends, the future of the human race on the earth appears 
dismal. The most dismal aspect is the apathy toward or the flagrant denial of 
this trend by our so-called leaders. Businessmen and politicians are 
clamoring for a more rapid acceleration of the very trends which are in 
force. These two groups of social traitors are even contemplating a third 
world war-the greatest of them all-although everybody who understands 
anything about it, warns that such a catastrophe would deplete the very 
resources on which our industrial civilization and 'high standard' of living 
depend.  
<p>
A few students of human affairs recognize what is happening and make a fairly 
accurate analysis of the situation. Their descriptions are clear; their 
analyses of the prevailing trends and appraisals of the danger leave no doubt 
as to the probability of dire consequences; and their warnings are almost 
hysterical. But when it comes to giving a synthesis for survival, most of 
their suggestions are puerile or fantastic-they lack the realism and boldness 
of concept which the analysis demands.  
<p>
Typical of this type of literature is William Vogt's book 'Road to Survival.' 
The author draws a very clear picture of the perils facing human civilization 
and gives some of the basic causes. His descriptions are vivid, his analysis 
is good, but his synthesis is pathetic. In the early part of the book he 
tells the story of a Chinese man by the name of Wong. Wong and his family are 
starving; so, Wong goes forth to see if somewhere he can scrape up something 
to eat. Meeting with repeated failure, Wong finally gives up and sits down to 
die.  
<p>
William Vogt is in some ways like Wong. He studies the situation, sees the 
facts, points out the trends, indicates in general what must be done; but, 
when he looks into the future, he sees little hope. After making a few 
puerile gestures toward a synthesis, he tosses the problem into the `lap of 
the gods' and, intellectually speaking, sits down to die.  
<p>
Vogt states that the program must have three parts: 'research, education, and 
action on the land.' He realizes that such a program must be organized, but 
does not know how it should be organized; he pleads incompetence, and 
expresses the hope that the United Nations will somehow acquire the vision 
and the unity needed to handle the job. He hates large technological 
operations (such as the Tennessee Valley Authority) and centralized 
industries; he wants to see some sort of a retrogressive trend toward small 
scale operation. He wants a program of birth control, one that is voluntary 
and which does not offend anybody or any institution. He proclaims his faith 
in democracy and recommends that we prepare to 'pull in our belts and accept 
a long period of austerity.' He hopes that if the dilemma is made known to 
all mankind, that somehow the people will see the light. Then he concludes;  
<p>
<blockquote>
`Unless we take these steps and begin to swing into them soon--unless in 
short, man readjusts his way of living, in its fullest sense, to the 
imperatives imposed by the limited resources of his environment--we may as 
well give up all hope of continuing civilized life. Like Gadarene swine, we 
shall rush down a war-torn slope to a barbarian existence in the blackened 
rubble.'  
</blockquote>
<p>
It is a sad commentary on the intelligence of the human species that it is 
not able to plan adequately for its own survival. Now that civilized man has 
become dominant in the organic world and has every advantage, it seems 
paradoxical that he should be headed pell-mell for oblivion.  
<p>
<h3>TECHNOCRACY PROPOSES</h3>
<p>
The picture might, indeed, be as dark as William Vogt paints it, except for 
the thinking of one man. One man had the intelligence, the strategical 
genius, and the integrity to develop an idea for human survival that is in 
harmony with the facts and with the social needs of man. At times almost 
single-handed this man, Howard Scott, worked out a strategy of social 
operations that could be blueprinted into a social plan for the North 
American Continent. This idea, in time, became known as Technocracy.  
<p>
But, Technocracy was not a popular program. If man was to survive, he would 
have to change many of his ways; he would have to abandon his concepts of 
individual anarchy; also, he would have to repudiate his politics, his 
business enterprises, and his uncontrolled wastage of natural resources. This 
did not set well with the people of North America; it did not cater to their 
soft, sentimental illusions. It made many enemies and it faced a stone wall 
of human inertia. It was not an idea that could win popular acceptance and 
support overnight. It was an idea that would have to penetrate slowly into 
the social intelligence of the people; but, it was an idea that had to grow 
and expand, for its time had come. It could not be denied for long.  
<p>
Technocracy is today the only refutation of the prediction that man's 
civilization is doomed to failure. Technocracy maintains that it is possible 
for man to remain the dominant species on earth and at the same time enjoy a 
high standard of living for many centuries to come. It is possible for him to 
be the climax species in a new ecological balance; and it is possible for him 
to do this at a level of existence even far above that of the average North 
American of today. It has the only blueprint for a high-energy social 
mechanism that will not run down.  
<p>
To do this, man must adopt a new strategy for his social operations and 
change his mode of living to conform to that strategy. He must return unto 
the ecological system as much as he takes from it. If man can do that, he can 
survive and flourish for thousands of years more on earth. If he does not do 
it, nature will take a ruthless course so far as the human species is 
concerned.  
<p>
Technocracy's blueprint pertains specifically to North America as an 
operational unit. If the world is ever to install a scientific social control 
it must begin somewhere. The reasons why Technocracy selects North America as 
the beginning place are two: (1) North America happens to be where the idea 
of Technocracy originated; it is the home of the Technocrats; (2) North 
America is the easiest place on which to install such an operation.  
<p>
This does not mean Technocrats ignore the rest of the world completely; 
rather, they have a serious concern for all areas of the earth. It is 
possible that eventually Technocracy will be introduced and installed on 
other continents; but it must be established in some one place first. It 
cannot be done everywhere at once. The most unfavorable parts of the world 
will have to be left in a state of virtual abandonment until more favorable 
areas are set up and operating.  
<p>
We do not wish to imply by the foregoing that Technocracy Inc. has a world 
program. We are merely making a long-range speculation for the future of an 
idea. Technocracy's only blueprint program is for North America. When 
Technocracy is well established here, that will be the time for us more 
seriously to contemplate the endemic problems of other parts of the earth. 
Technocracy is a forceful and realistic program with a superb strategy in 
support of human survival and advancement. It is not a weak philosophical 
dream, infected with the virus of a wishful-thinking good will. It is a 
program with concept stern enough to get the job done. It is as 
uncompromising as the grim question which must be answered soon--the question 
of survival.  
<p>
Man's existence under the Price System is transitional; for the Price System 
does not provide the strategy for a long-term survival. It only offers man a 
chance to reap a quick profit and move on. The bonanza of Price System 
enterprise is even now running into borasca. A new concept and a new pattern 
of economic living is mandatory for the future if man's ecological position 
is to be to his liking. That concept and that pattern cannot be found within 
the framework of the Price System. That means that North Americans cannot go 
on doing for long what they are now doing. They can adhere stubbornly to the 
concepts of the status quo and blunder into catastrophe, or they can accept 
the planned progression outlined by Howard Scott and advance upward into the 
future. Technocracy is prepared to show the way.  
<p>
In order to continue at a high level of civilization for an indefinite period 
of time, North Americans must do these things:  
<p>
They must conserve the fresh water of the Continent and return it to the 
ground in such a way as to build up the water table and maintain it at as 
favorable a level as possible. This can be done most effectively through the 
Continental Hydrology Program designed by Technocracy. This program provides 
for the maximum use of the fresh water resources of the Continent on a 
balanced basis.  
<p>
They must return the soil the fertility which is taken from it in the process 
of raising plants and animals. For the most part, this means that the 
fertility must never leave the soil area. We cannot depend indefinitely on 
scarce deposits of mineral fertilizer to make up for the wasteful depletion 
of the natural fertility. Such a program demands a Continental agrobiology, 
scientifically designed, wherein the plant and animal crop of the Continent 
will provide an abundance of food for the population and products for the 
industries of the Continent, without depleting the productivity of the soil. 
Only Technocracy can furnish the strategy necessary to the solution of that 
problem.  
<p>
They must be careful in their use of the non-replaceable mineral resources of 
the Continent. More abundant materials should be used wherever possible in 
place of scarce materials and replaceable materials used in place of non 
replaceable materials. Then a program of maximum use and maximum recovery 
must be instituted. We cannot afford, for example, to discard 48 billion 
metal cans and 26 billion bottles on the national trash-piles each year, nor 
be lavish in the use of lead as a basic ingredient for paint. This program 
can be carried out, but not under the Price System. We must turn again to 
Technocracy for the answer.  
<p>
They must establish a balanced utilization of energy. We cannot plan to 
operate for long on fossil fuel as our major energy source. Instead, we must 
adopt a system of energy use which will obtain a maximum amount of energy 
from renewable sources and a minimum amount from nonrenewable sources. 
Technocracy's program provides for such an energy balance. The Price System 
on the other hand refuses to face the problem, but seeks to deplete our 
limited fossil fuels at the maximum rate that will yield a 'fair return' in 
the way of profits.  
<p>
They must institute a program of population control which will keep the 
population within the bounds of the long-range capacity of food, water, 
minerals and energy supplies. North America is not seriously overburdened 
with population at present, but it is gradually approaching that condition. 
The population of North America should not much exceed 200 million. No 
political party can touch these problems concerning the population, but 
science can find a ready answer.  
<p>
We have here presented the problem of North America in bare outline. And we
have pointed out some of the goals that must be reached. But it is evident
that the problem will not solve itself--at least not in any way that we will
like. <em>It can only be solved by an intentional and coordinated
effort on the part of North American citizens to get it solved.</em>
They must be the ones who execute the tactics which support the
strategy for survival.
<p>
The Price System does not have any strategy for survival; it does not even 
have the mechanism by which an effective strategy can be implemented. In the 
long run, the operations of the Price System are defeatist. The Price System 
can only mine out the resources and move on. When the resources are gone--what 
then? Well, that day is rushing upon us. Our technological development has 
given it a momentum that it never had before. This generation must face the 
problem and find the answer.  
<p>
<em>Technocracy has always pointed out that Technocracy's method of social 
operation will not be adopted because it is desirable, but because it is 
necessary. The choice is literally between--Technocracy and chaos.</em>
<p>
Science applied to the social order is the only effective technique of doing 
this. This is the method of Technocracy. Science has never yet let the human 
race down; business and politics have never done otherwise. Technocracy is 
non-business and non-political--it is strictly scientific. It alone can meet 
the requirements.  
<p>
As painful as it may be to you, you must make a decision. The March of Events 
will not let you sit on a fence or equivocate for long. So, you might as well 
decide now. Which are you for--the `blundercrats' of the Price System, or, the 
Technocrats? No matter how smart you are in the immediate manipulations of the 
moment, you have no security under `blunderocracy.' The only future 
worthwhile is a future in Technocracy.
<p>
You do not have to he a genius to be a Technocrat. But you must have 
integrity and an attitude of cooperative endeavor. You must be prepared to 
function as an integral part of a self-disciplined body of people with a 
definite social objective. In Technocracy, there are many `little' jobs to 
be done which are as important as the so-called big jobs. In Technocracy, 
there is no place for individual anarchy, ego inflation, or opinionation. But 
there is plenty of room for function and it is function that will get the job 
done. There is no material reward and no glory beyond the satisfaction of 
doing what must be done.  
<p>
For all who can qualify on this basis, there is room and a job in 
Technocracy. Can you qualify?
