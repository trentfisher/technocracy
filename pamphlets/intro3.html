Problems)

<P>
Technocracy is a research organization founded in 1920, composed of
scientists, technologists, physicists, and biochemists. It
was organized to collect and collate data on the physical functioning
of the social mechanism on the North American Continent,
and to portray the relationship of this Continent, and the magnitude
of its operations in quantitative comparison with other continental
areas of the world. Its methods are the result of a synthetic
integration of the physical sciences that pertain to the determination
of all functional sequences of social phenomena.
<P>
Technocracy makes one basic postulate: that the phenomena involved in
the functional operation of a social mechanism are
metrical. It defines science as `the methodology of the determination
of the most probable.' Technocracy therefore assumes from
its postulate that there already exist fundamental and arbitrary
units which, in conjunction with derived units, can be extended
to form a new and basic method for the quantitative analysis and
determination of the next most probable state of any social
mechanism. Technocracy further states that as all organic and
inorganic
mechanisms involved in the operation of the social macrocosm are
energy-consuming devices, therefore the basic metrical relationships
are: the factor of energy conversion, or efficiency; and the
rate of conversion of available energy of the mechanism as a
functional whole in a given area per time unit. Technocracy
accordingly establishes a new technique of social mensuration, that is
to say, a process for determining the rates of growth of all
energy-consuming devices within the limits of the next most probable
energy state.
<P>
The Energy Survey of North America now being conducted by
Technocracy in association with the Industrial Engineering Department
of Columbia University and the Architects' Emergency
Committee (1932) has found that employment of this method has not
only yielded new data but has endowed already existing data with
a new significance. As the above method is one of measurement, it
follows axiomatically that all processes of evaluation are excluded.
Value has no metrical equivalent.
<P>
Value is defined by the economists as the measure of the force of
desire. It has its physical manifestation in any one commodity
unit by which all other commodities or services are evaluated. Any
society using a commodity method of valuation shall herein be said
to be employing a Price System.
<P>
<H3>Social Change</H3>
<P>
A `social steady state' is a social mechanism whose per capita rate
of energy conversion is not changing appreciably with time. Social
change, on the other hand, may be defined as the change in the
per capita rate of energy conversion, or the change from one order
of magnitude to another in the social conversion of the available
energy. All social history prior to the last century and a half,
viewed technologically, may therefore be described as the record
of a steady state. Only within the last hundred and fifty years has
there been introduced a technique that has specifically caused social
change. Technology, as the executor of physical science, is the
instrument for effecting social change.
<P>
During the 200,000 years prior to 1800 the biological progression of
man in his struggle for subsistence on this earth, had advanced so far
that the total world population in that year reached
the approximate number of 850,000,000. During the subsequent
132 years world population has attained such heights that it now
exceeds a total of 1,80,000,000; in other words, the population
increase in the last 132 years has been greater than it was in the
previous 200,000. Most of this increase in the human species has
been made possible by the social introduction of technological
procedures, that is, change in the means whereby we live as brought 
about solely by the introduction of technology.
<P>
A century ago these United States had a population of approximately
12,000,000; whereas today our census figures give a total of
over 122,000,000--a tenfold increase in the century. One hundred years
ago in these United States we consumed less than 75
trillion British Thermal Units of extraneous energy per annum;
whereas in 1929 we consumed approximately 27,000 trillion British
Thermal Units--an increase Of 353-fold in the century. Our
energy consumption now exceeds 150,000 kilogram-calories per
capita per day; whereas in the year 1800 our consumption of extraneous
energy was probably not less than 1,600 nor more than
2,000 kilogram-calories per capita per day.
<P>
The United States of our forefathers, with 1,2,000,000 inhabitants,
performed its necessary work in almost entire dependence
upon the human engine, which, as its chief means of energy conversion,
was aided and abetted only by domestic animals, and a few
water wheels. The United States today has over one billion installed
horsepower. In 1929, these engines of energy conversion, 
though operated only to partial capacity, nevertheless had an output
that represented approximately 50 percent of the total work
of the world. When one realizes that the technologist has succeeded
to such an extent that he is today capable of building and operating
engines of energy conversion that have nine million times the output
capacity of the average single human being working an eight
hour day, one begins to understand the significance of this
acceleration, beginning with man as the chief engine of energy conversion 
and culminating with these huge extensions of his original one tenth of
a horsepower. Then add the fact that of this 9,000,000
fold acceleration 8,766,000 has occurred since the year 1900.
<P>
Stated in another way, if the total one billion installed horsepower
of the United States were operated to full capacity, its output would
be equivalent to the human labor of over five times the
present total world population.
<P>
<H3>The Arrival of Certainty</H3>
<P>
Physical science has outdistanced present social institutions to
such an extent that man, for the first time in history, finds himself
occupying a position in which a complete utilization of his knowledge
would assure the arrival of certainty in a continental social
mechanism. Man, in his age-long struggle for leisure and the
elimination of toil, is now at last confronted not only by the
possibility but by the probability of this arrival. Such a new era in
human life is technologically dependent only upon an I extension of
the physical sciences and the equipment at hand.
<P>
But the pathway to that new era is blockaded with all the riffraff
of social institutions carried over from yesterday's seven thousand
static years. The law of the next arrival is depicted by the Gaussian
curve of probability, or the next most probable energy state.
<P>
America faces the threshold of the new era with the greatest total
debt load ever carried by any social mechanism, a debt of over
$218,000,000,000 against her physical equipment and its operation.
With the number of unemployed greater than the total population
of a century ago; with one of the most providential geologic set-ups
of any continental area; still possessing more energy and mineral
resources than any like area on the world's surface; having more
than one billion installed horsepower of prime movers wherewith
to degrade available energy into use-forms; possessing a personnel
of over 300,000 technically trained men in many varied engineering
fields and more than 4,000,000 men partially trained and functionally
capable of operating the greatest array of productive equipment ever
at the disposal of man-with all this, we have nevertheless, failed to
profit from technological advances, and accordingly
find ourselves, for the first time in history, with an economy of
plenty existing in the midst of a hodgepodge of debt and unemployment.
<P>
<H3>America and Europe</H3>
<P>
America can expect no help in the solution of this problem from
any current social theory. What has the world to offer toward such
a solution? Europe discovered America in 1492. Today America
is further away from Europe than she was when Columbus sailed.
The America of tomorrow will necessitate a rediscovery by Europe.
European culture and traditions have nothing of worthwhile importance
to offer America in this twilight period preceding the
dawn of a new era. No European importations of social or political
theory can have the slightest value in solving the operational
problems facing America today. Arising out of areas that lack adequate
physical equipment and trained personnel, areas in which only a
low percentage of the population is disciplined in engineering
thought processes, European socio-political philosophies and
theories are the natural outgrowth of a more classified division and
orientation of the entrepreneur sectionalism of the Price System.
No theory of social action or governance now existing or proposed
in Europe would in any way be endemic to that unique set-up of
geologic conformation, technique, equipment, and personnel peculiar to
North America.
<P>
Russia, of whose population 92 percent were tillers of the soil
under the ancien regime and which had meagre technical facilities
and more musicians than technologists, found itself in the position
of being compelled to inaugurate an industrial era under a communistic
Price System of production. Soviet Russia was forced to
call upon the outside world for technical assistance in order to
perpetrate reproductions of factories already obsolescent from an
obsolescent Price System. Russia, in its Parthian retreat from
capitalism, has scored but a Pyrrhic victory. It mistook the name tag of
one phase of the Price System for that system's entirety; it abandoned
the tag, but retained the essential mechanics.
<P>
To approach social phenomena by substituting Hegelian for
Aristotelian dialectics may be an interesting intellectual pastime,
but it has no functional importance: it is but one more recrudescence
of the philosophic futility implicit in European tradition.
<P>
The England of the Black Prince, with its population of 5,000,000, its
wealth of oak timber, its hearty people drinking deeply of
ale (made not from hops but from barley malt), its original resources
of copper, lead, tin, iron ore, and coal--this England developed under
the Price System of production. Inevitably, like
the prodigal son, England went forth into the world and squandered
its inheritance among the harpies of world trade and debt creation.
<P>
The United Kingdom, with an area of 121,000 square miles and
a population Of 49,000,000--or a density Of 400 inhabitants per
square mile--with arable land amounting to only 23 percent of the
total national area, finds itself in the physical position of possessing
only a single energy resource, and that a declining one. Its tin
gone, as well as its copper and lead, its iron requiring 56 percent
foreign beneficiation in order to produce steel, its coal becoming
more and more difficult to mine, the United Kingdom is fast
retrogressing from its position as the possessor of easily available
energy to its next most probable energy state as two islands off the
coast of the European continent. A valiant race, fighting a losing
battle, is displaying an admirable fortitude in the crisis that is
resulting from excess population, declining resources, and obsolescent
equipment operated by the antiquated methods of a Price System.
<P>
The United Kingdom will be forced by internal pressure to adopt
measures even more extreme than the flight from the gold pound.
It may be compelled by the growing disparity between its own
industrial operation and the world trade balance to such extremities
as abandonment of monetary currency and the accompanying credit
structure. In that event, a British currency of pure fiat power
might be attempted as a last desperate resort. The present
deflationary program may be reversed in the near future to one of
inflation, a last straw grasped at in England's struggle for the export
markets of the world. Sooner or later, in spite of British
imperialism, the United Kingdom, under a Price System, will be forced to 
meet a situation that will be increasingly grave in its internal
operation. There remains only the colonizing soporific of bestowing a 
surplus population of 35,000,000 on the overseas Dominions.
<P>
Fascism, that strange but natural partnership of the Italian political
state and vested interests, is a process of consolidating all the
minor rackets into one major monopoly. Such a condition brought
with it the sequelae of discipline and sanitation that necessarily
accompany complete trustification. Italy, which is insufficiently
supplied with energy and mineral resources, which possesses only
a limited amount of water power and volcanic heat, which has some
mercury and sulphur but no coal, oil, or gas, no iron ore, copper, tin,
lead, or zinc, and which lacks a high enough percentage of arable
land to grow sufficient foodstuffs for its own needs--Italy belongs to
the geologic order of areas that cannot create and operate an
industrial energy civilization. Fascist Italy is rapidly increasing its 
dangerous overload of population by granting national bonuses
to large families in furtherance of its <em>mare nostrum</em> policy. Fascism
is an attempt at a last-ditch defense of a Price System, an effort to
maintain an unbroken front against oncoming social change; but
this unbroken front is spurious in that it is being temporarily
maintained by foreign importation of energy resource materials,
supplemented by the manna of the Lord.
<P>
<H3>Now, A New Civilization</H3>
<P>
Egypt, Assyria, Greece, Rome, and, in the Victorian age, Imperial
Britain have all led the world in their day; each in turn has been
the vanguard of civilization. The past is strewn with ruins of
empire. Now there is but one continental area that from the standpoint
of its geologic set-up, equipment, personnel, and the state of
its technology is competent and ready to inaugurate a new era in
the life of man.
<P>
America stands on the threshold of that new era, but she will have
to leave behind all the wish-fulfilling thought and romantic concepts
of value that are the concomitants of a Price System. So, too, all
philosophic approaches to social phenomena, from Plato to--and
including--Marx, must functionally be avoided. Economics, that
pathology of debt, not containing within itself any modulus or
calculus of design or operation, must likewise be discarded with the
other historical antiquities. No political method of arriving at
social decisions is adequate in continental areas under technological
control, for the scientific technique of decision arrivation has no
political antecedents.
<P>
<H3>Wealth and Income</H3>
<P>
Under a Price System wealth arises solely through the creation of
debt. In other words, Price System wealth consists of debt claims
against the operation of the physical equipment and its resultants.
Physical wealth, on the other hand, is produced by converting
available energy into use-forms and services. The process of being
wealthy is the degradation of the resultants of the above conversions
into complete uselessness-in other words, total consumption.
To be physically wealthy is not to own a car but to wear it out.
Technology has introduced a new methodology in the creation of
physical wealth. It is now able to substitute energy for man hours
on the parity basis that 1,500,000 foot pounds equals one man's time
for eight hours. National income under the Price System consists
of the debt claims accruing annually from the certificates of debt
already extant. Physical income within a continental area under
technological control would be the net available energy in ergs,
converted into use-forms and services over and above the operation
and maintenance of the physical equipment and structures of the
area.
<P>
Individual income under a Price System consists of units that are
not comensurate with the quanta by which the rate of flow of the
physical equipment is measured, and upon which the social mechanism
depends for its continuance. Individualism is therefore favored
under a Price System, since individualism can obtain a monetary
equivalent proportional to the individual's ability to create debt.
Individual income under such a system therefore depends on the
extent to which advantage is exercised by means of the interference
control that is dominant throughout the whole system of debt
creation.
<P>
Individual income under technological control would consist of
units commensurate with the quanta by which the rate of flow of
the physical equipment is measured throughout the entire continental
area. The unit income of the individual would be determined by the
period necessary in that area to maintain a thermodynamically balanced
load, that is to say, the time it takes for a
complete cycle of the operating and production procedures to be
completed.
<P>
Any unit of <em>value</em> under a Price System is a certification of debt.
Any unit of <em>measurement</em> under technological control would be a
certification of available energy converted. Such units of
certification would have validity only during the balanced load period for
which they were issued. This method of producing physical wealth
and measuring its operation precludes the possibility of creating
any kind of debt. It also eliminates the entire domain of
philanthropy. Furthermore, all bonds, financial debentures, and other
instrumentalities of debt would cease to exist, since they do not
have one iota of usefulness in the physical operation of such an
area under technological control.
<P>
<H3>The Force of a Social Progression</H3>
<P>
Technocracy, as a body of thought, poses the problem raised by
the technological introduction of energy factors in a modern
industrial social mechanism. Continental America possesses all the
essential qualifications for such a mechanism-sufficient energy and
mineral resources; adequate water precipitation; more than enough
arable land of proper chemical stability; highly developed
technological facilities backed by a trained personnel; powerful
research organizations. All these things are entirely sufficient to
assure the continuance of a high energy standard of livelihood for at
least a thousand years, if they are operated on a non-price basis with
the technological means known at present.
<P>
The progression of a modern industrial social mechanism is
unidirectional and irreversible. Physically this Continental area has
no choice but to proceed with the further elimination of toil
through the substitution of energy for man hours. There can be
no question of returning to premachine or pretechnological ways
of life; a progression once started must continue. Retrogressive
evolution does not exist.
