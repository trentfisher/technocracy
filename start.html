<h1>Starting Points for Technocracy Literature</h1>
<p>
This page is intended to help you pick an appropriate starting point
in Technocracy's literature according to your interests.
Technocracy's body of thought covers a wide range of issues, and as
more information becomes available via the web, it will get harder to
find information about a particular subject.
<p>
Suggestions for this page are welcome (needed!).

  <dt><strong>Environmental Issues</strong>
  <dd>Many people seem to think that technology and science conflict
      with ecology; that a sustainable society cannot be technological.
      But Technocrats have long been concerned with environmental
      issues:  The article
      <a href="pamphlets/ecology-of-man.html">
      The Ecology of Man</a> was published in 1948, a time when few
      were talking about such issues.
      Some more recent articles clarifying this misunderstanding are:
      <a href="periodicals/nwtechnocrat/325/doll.html">The Price System
      vs. The Environment: A Message To Environmental Groups</a>,
      <a href="periodicals/nwtechnocrat/337/doll.html">Accounting For
      Nature: Moving Toward Resource-Based Economics</a>,
      <a href="periodicals/nwtechnocrat/322/scheel.html">
      Spotted Owl Fever (A Political Disease)</a> and 
      <a href="periodicals/nwtechnocrat/346/doll.html">It Really
      Doesn't Grow On Trees</a>.
      There are many other articles along these lines.

  <dt><strong>Resource Depletion</strong>
  <dd>When will we run out of oil? fresh water? arable land?
      These, and many other, resources are essential to maintain human
      civilization, or even to our survival as a species.
      <a href="periodicals/technocracy/a12/mostprob.html">
      Determining the Most Probable</a> by
      <a href="people/m-king-hubbert.html">M. King Hubbert</a>
      A more recent article is
      <a href="periodicals/social-trends/151/trendevents.html">
      Racing Toward Finiteness</a>

  <dt><strong>Technological Unemployment</strong>
  <dd>Do machines create or destroy jobs?  This was the primary
      questions that the predecesors to Technocracy were trying to
      answer.
      <a href="../technocracy/people/m-king-hubbert.html">M. King
      Hubbert</a>'s pamphlet <a
      href="pamphlets/man-hours-distribution.html">Man-Hours and
      Distribution</a> is the most detailed approach to this problem.
      
  <dt><strong>History</strong>
  <dd>If you are interested in the beginnings of Technocracy, <a
      href="periodicals/technocracy/a19/hotel-pierre.html">The Hotel
      Pierre Address</a> is a good starting point, as it was given at
      the heart of the Technocracy ``frenzy'' of 1932-3.
      The booklet <a href="pamphlets/intro.html">
      Introduction To Technocracy</a> was put out about the same time.
      <a href="articles/social-objectives.html">A Statement of the Social 
      Objectives of Technocracy</a> was the first statement from
      Technocracy, Inc. in March, 1933.
      <p>
      More historical information can be found in the booklet
      <a href="pamphlets/history-and-purpose.html">
      History and Purpose of Technocracy</a>.

  <dt><strong>Misrepresentation of Technocracy</strong>
  <dd>Over the years, Technocracy has been misrepresented or the word
      misused.  Many people have been labeled ``technocrats'', many of whom
      actually had opposing views.  These articles address some of
      these misuses:
      <a href="./periodicals/nwtechnocrat/319/scheel.html">Meanderings
      Into Obfuscation</a>,
      <a href="./periodicals/nwtechnocrat/237/who-is-a-technocrat.html">
      Who Is A Technocrat?</a>.
