This is the web site of Techocracy, Inc which I ran, in various forms,
from around 1993 until 2000.  The organization started their own web
site at that time, and all work on this site ceased.  However, most of
the material here, which I meticulously scanned from old magazines,
typed in, or collected from other people, was never incorporated into
the new web site.  That was disappointing to me on several levels.

Therefore, I am preserving this information here as it may be of
interest to some people.

I first joined the organization in 1983 and was a 'true believer' for
some years.  By the time I started doing this web site (around 1993),
I had a more nuanced view of things (which may be apparent in the my
writings).  In mid 2000 the organization's leadership asked to take
over the web site and domain, which was just as well as I was rapidly
drifting away from them by that time.  I am no longer involved with
the organization in any way.
