<h1>What's Planned for the Technocracy Web Pages</h1>
<p>
Here is a list of what I have planned for the Technocracy Web Pages.

<ul>
  <li>list various sections with their "online" representative on the
      contacts page.
  <li>set up a small page for each author or other important figures
      in Technocracy.  I have started setting this up, contributions
      are needed.
  <li>Fix up, and make uniform, the format for briefs.  Finish the
      compleat listing.
  <li>Categorize/sort the reading list.
  <li>Get more articles.  Since the magazines have been done on
      computer for several years, I am starting to get the computer
      files directly from the editors.
      The earlier stuff needs to be scanned or typed in.  I now have
      access to a scanner, so let <a
      href="mailto:trent@cs.pdx.edu">me</a> know of anything  you
      particularily want to see.   Here's the list of what I would
      like to have:
      <ul>
	<li>Anything by Wilton Ivie
	<li>Anything by M. King Hubbert
	<li>Any other suggestions??
      </ul>
      If you want to do anything along these lines, please coordinate
      with me.
  <li>Further corrections to the <a href="periodicals/">periodicals page</a>
</ul>

<p>
Of course, my dream is to have everything Technocracy has ever done
available on computer (maybe CD-ROM?).
