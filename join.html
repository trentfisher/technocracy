<h1>How to Join Technocracy, Inc.</h1>
<p>
If, after studying our literature, you would like to help us in our
work, we would welcome you to join our organization.
Membership is open to all North Americans, except for politicians
(anybody who holds an elective office or active office in a political party).
<p>
Technocracy Inc's membership structure is somewhat decentralized.
Normally, you would join a nearby group.  For help in locating such a
group see the <a href="contacts.html">contact points</a> page.
If there is no nearby group you would need to apply for membership
directly to CHQ.
<p>
The annual dues are $15.00.
