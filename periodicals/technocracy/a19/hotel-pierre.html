<p>
Technocracy, speaking tonight from Regional Division 7340, salutes 
the radio audience of America.
<p>
At the outset, Technocracy desires it to be understood that all of 
this publicity has broken upon it like nothing else that has 
happened to any similar organization in the history of man. Months 
ago we were unknown, working quietly as a non-profit research 
organization which in the year 1932 had expended less than $1,200 
for administrative purposes and had received not more than $300 
exclusive of the subscriptions of its members. To date it has 
written fewer than 14,000 words but, judging from the response on 
this Continent and abroad, those 14,000 words have done their work 
well--too well perhaps, since most of the clamor in the press, 
pulpit and elsewhere has not, of necessity, the slightest genuine 
connection with the work, data and principles of Technocracy. Let 
it be said also that most of the many attacks against us originate 
in the camps of the liberals, economists, social philosophers and 
others of the tribe of <a href="#axiologists">axiologists*</a> who are
all interested in the
preservation of `values' that have no functional relationship to 
the problems of a modern industrial society. These attacks, 
however beneficial to newspaper and publishing interests, have 
added nothing to a proper understanding of our work.
<p>
Technocracy is a dual thing. On the one hand it is an organization 
of scientists, engineers, technologists and workers in other 
technical fields; on the other, it is a body of thought. This body 
of thought may be concisely described as a technological approach 
to, and an analysis of, all social phenomena. Technocracy is not 
premised on any philosophical preconceptions, convictions or 
beliefs. Technocracy is based primarily on a study of the rates of 
growth of all energy-consuming devices on this Continent as a 
function of time. Technocracy is concerned with the natural 
resources available for conversion into use-forms and their 
quantities; with the quantity of energy and materials consumed in 
the proper operation of the physical equipment on this area; with 
the number of people required in this total operation and the 
hours of work within a given time. These are some of the principal 
questions with which Technocracy has always been, and is now, 
concerned.
<p>
Tonight we would like to take this gathering and the radio 
audience of this Continent back a few pages in the history of this 
country and in the biologic progression of man.
<p>
Ever since man was driven from the jungle by his more agile but 
less enterprising relative, the ape, he has been conducting a long 
and arduous struggle, fighting his way toward ever more effective 
sources of energy. In this struggle the problem of population has 
come to play an increasingly important part. For example: in the 
200,000 years prior to 1800 the biologic progression had so far 
advanced that the total world population of the human species in 
the latter year was approximately 850,000,000. In the subsequent 
132 years this population grew until it is now approximately 
1,800,000,000--a greater increase than in the previous 200,000 
years.
<p>
The point to be especially noted is that most of this population 
increase is due to the introduction of technological procedures 
into social life. By way of contrast, consider China. According to 
the Nanking estimates of 1932, China has a population of 
470,000,000 today an estimated growth of only 71,000,000 in the 
past two centuries. France--according to the estimates of Reid, 
Baker, and others--would require over four hundred years to double 
its present population of approximately 40,000,000. <em>Both of these 
countries are admittedly backward in their rates of growth on the 
technological level</em>; that is to say, neither of them has taken 
full advantage of the incentive to population increase afforded by 
the introduction of technological procedures into their social 
life.
<p>
Compare these examples with the United States. In 1830, slightly 
over a century ago, this country had a little more than 12,000,000 
people. Today the figure is approximately 122,000,000--an increase 
of 10 times in a century. Now set these figures against the 
background of the energy consumption during the same period: In 
1830 we were consuming as a nation less than 75 trillion British 
Thermal Units of total extraneous physical energy (derived 
principally from windmills and domestic animals with some coal and 
water power.) In 1929 we consumed slightly less than 27,000 
trillion British Thermal Units of extraneous physical energy--an 
increase in the century of 353 times. What is the drift of such 
facts--which can be supported and strengthened from many sources?
<p>
Technocracy points out that in all social systems prior to the 
last 200 years man was the chief engine of energy conversion. 
Efficient from the mechanical point of view, this engine was 
severely limited in output, rating at approximately one tenth 
horsepower per eight-hour day. All the work and wealth of human 
society from the dawn of recorded history to the beginning of the 
18th century depended exclusively upon this engine. Thus we have 
Adam Smith, in the opening sentence of his famous book, (published 
in the same year as America's Declaration of Independence and, 
ironically, within a short distance of the town where James Watt 
was developing his steam engine) defining wealth in terms of <em>human 
labor</em> which in turn created all <em>values</em>. This was a correct 
description of the conditions of which Adam Smith wrote, but it 
has since become increasingly evident that man, as a creator of 
physical wealth, is receding more and more into the background, 
yielding, and not unwillingly, to the rapid growth of technology 
and of power procedures. Technocracy emphasizes that in all the 
older social systems there was no means of altering the <em>rate of 
doing work</em>: You could increase the total number of human beings 
only up to the physical limits of the area in which they lived, 
that limit reached, migration was the only alternative to the 
reduction of population by mass famine.
<p>
On this Continent, a century ago, the log cabins of our 
forefathers required for their operation and maintenance only the 
simplest of water-wheels, and windmills. There was no integration, 
no coordination or synchronization. The individual ego could be 
exercised to the full, and each local area could be manipulated 
according to the whims of the individual operator. At this point 
we come to the basic question--the operation of a physical 
apparatus.
<p>
The law of impact states that when two oxcarts collide at three 
miles per hour there is no great danger of any serious results, 
and at this rate in an oxcart civilization you could do without 
good roads and stringent driving regulations. The driver could 
fall asleep, and even when awake required only moderate 
intelligence to prevent the mild order of disaster which might 
result from inattention; but increase the speed of the vehicle and 
the sequence of operations instantly changes. With a modern 
automobile you require not only roads but good roads. You cannot 
drive at sixty miles an hour on blind earth; the faster your rate 
of motion the smoother must be the path you traverse. Speeds of 
that order require a given curvature of road to prevent disaster, 
the maximum curvature possible for a road designed to carry 
traffic at any given speed can be determined in advance--and this 
determination will have no regard of the personal idiosyncrasies 
and capacities of the operator.
<p>
We have been experiencing a change in the magnitude of social 
operations due to the accelerating rate of doing work on this 
Continent. For precisely the same reasons we must consider, 
quantitatively, without personal allowances, the proper conditions 
under which this work may be accomplished smoothly.
<p>
It has often been said that if we could take the Chinese and 
somehow raise them bodily to the standard of living that prevails 
on the American Continent, not only China and the Orient would be 
benefited thereby, but prosperity would return to the United 
States and the Occident. Such reasoning is characteristic of the 
present confusion in social thinking which is still based upon the 
classical economics of human labor and `value.' When, however, one 
realizes that prior to 1830 we, on this Continent and everywhere 
else in the world, consumed not over 2,000 kilogram-calories of 
extraneous energy per capita per day, and that in 1929 we, on this 
Continent alone, consumed a maximum of 154,000 kilogram-calories 
of extraneous energy per capita per day_when we realize this, the 
problem of China takes on a new and unsuspected aspect. In brief, 
in order to raise the standard of living of China to the present 
level of the North American Continent it would be necessary to 
expend two and one-half times the total energy consumed by the 
entire globe in 1929--a little puzzle which we may reasonably doubt 
even the capacity of the Chinese to solve.
<p>
Now, in 1933, after three years of the most unprecedented 
conditions that this country has ever known, when the oscillations 
of production have gone to greater extremes than have ever been 
witnessed in any preceding depression, we find ourselves with more 
unemployed than we had total population a century ago. Each 
succeeding declination in the production curves of pig-iron or of             
almost any other major industrial commodity swings lower, calling 
more forcibly to our attention the problems peculiar to a society 
increasingly dependent upon the correct operation of its physical 
equipment. It is these problems which Technocracy now poses, 
stating in particular that the continued substitution of physical 
energy for man-hours results, <em>not in technological unemployment, 
but in a reduction of total employment and of total purchasing 
power.</em>
<p>
Granting this inexorable replacement of human labor by physical 
energy, Technocracy makes the further statement that such a 
condition brings the social mechanism of this Continent into sharp 
conflict with the interference control vested in the <em>Price System</em>
of production. The Price System, which we have defined as `any 
exchange or energy flow control founded upon a commodity 
valuation,' originated under those social conditions where human 
labor was the prime factor in the performance of work and the 
creation of wealth. The `values' upon which this system rests and 
by which alone it may continue to function might be described as 
the condensation of human perspiration. Once you eliminate that 
sheer human toil becomes functionally insignificant--you have 
struck at the very heart of the Price System fundamental postulate 
is the continuance of man-hours as an appreciable factor in the 
total energy consumed by society. You cannot continue to eliminate 
man-hour an expect the Price System to remain stable: It will go 
out of balance in proportion to the rate of <em>social change</em> and 
social change is here quantitatively defined as proportional to 
the rate of substitution of extraneous physical for man-hours in 
the operation and maintenance industrial social mechanism.
<p>
By way of illustration: Our first blast furnace in Massachusetts 
turned out approximately 3 tons of pig-iron a week. (My authority 
here is a published advertisement of the New York Trust Company.) 
A modern furnace, operating with less than half of the earlier 
total of men per furnace, will do over 1,000 tons per day are 
speaking, remember, of <em>changes of rate</em>, not total employees
in the iron and steel industries.
<p>
The number of people required to shovel sand, coal or by 
individual labor may be realized when you watch a power shovel 
with a 100-foot beam and a 95-foot moving 15 or 18 cubic yards of 
material a vertical distance equivalent to a six story building. 
Just how laborers would be required to move one load of that 
shovel an equal distance?
<p>
We are not here attempting to say--as many of critics charge us 
with saying--that America is on the verge of chaos or an evil doom. 
We have merely maintained that <em>if present trends
continue</em>--and we
see no chance of them abating--you may expect a greater 
unemployment in this country within eighteen month at the present 
rate of these trends, and assuming continuance, it is conservative 
to envisage a total unemployment in the United States within this 
period of 20,000,000.
<p>
We make this statement knowing full well that moratoriums, 
inflation, and all other possible palliative are going to be 
attempted with all the astuteness and dexterity that political 
chicanery can bring to bear in dealing with the problems of this 
Continent. We know also that the debt merchants will exercise 
their legerdemain to the full in order to save the face of the 
present situation. Inflation, which is now one of the prime 
concerns of Congress, would be of real interest only to those who 
possess above a certain number of debt claims, because they alone 
can go into debt fast enough to take advantage of inflation. The 
man who works for wages or a salary cannot go into debt and thus 
cannot take advantage of inflation, the privilege of debt being in 
other hands.
<p>
So it has come about that Technocracy, in the full blaze of world 
publicity, will experience attempted exploitation by those with 
whom it has, and can have, nothing in common. The politicians and 
debt merchants of the day will be moved to employ Technocracy as 
one of the cornerstones of a new political state; they may even go 
so far that, under the color of Technocracy, an institutional 
fascism will be introduced as one of the dictatorial prerequisites 
of the incoming president. This and many other efforts will be 
made to utilize the work which Technocracy so quietly initiated, 
but we, ourselves, will consistently maintain the position from 
which we started--that you cannot continue to do certain things on 
this Continent; that people and times have changed, and that any 
decisive moves toward readjustment must be the responsibility of 
those who control the policies of this country.
<p>
We have accomplished very little, but it has become clear that, if 
present conditions continue, we shall be forced to consider 
problems more grave than any with which this country has so far 
concerned itself. Yet America has just lately had a national 
election, and not a single outstanding figure in politics or 
finance has come forward with any proposal that has one iota of 
usefulness in dealing with these conditions and these problems.
<p>
To an outside observer America would appear to be a nation that is 
rapidly sinking to greater social instability and whose leaders 
lack intelligence to offer us more than soporifics and 
palliatives. The past three years have brought forth nothing 
genuinely relevant to the situation and, if this barrenness 
persists for another ten years, we are due for one of the gravest 
social readjustments that this country has ever experienced.
<p>
James Watt produced his steam engine at about the time the 
Constitution of this country was drawn up. There is a profound 
significance in this fact. It meant that the epoch of social 
change, as above defined, opened with the commencement of the 
United States as an independent political unit. It meant that all 
the political instruments and economic theories carried over from 
an older time would become obsolescent on an area exceptionally 
favored by nature for the richest development of power--an area to 
be subsequently exploited to the full in that direction.
<p>
A similar irony of events brings me to speak tonight in a hotel 
that yesterday was sold on the block under the hammer of the 
auctioneer. Symbol enough of the financial obsolescence brought 
about by the very technological procedures misapplied to its 
design and construction! As the Irishman said, `Sure and it was no 
good before it was built.' Throughout the United States today we 
have an identical situation.
<p>
Bear well in mind that under a Price System monetary wealth is 
equivalent to the creation of debt; <em>physical wealth</em>, on the other 
hand, is the conversion of available energy into use-forms and 
services. Under a Price System the process of being wealthy is the 
collection of debt claims (such claims being represented by the 
amount of `money' you possess); <em>physical wealth</em>, on the other 
hand, is a degradation of converted energy into total uselessness, 
or, complete consumption. You are not physically wealthy in the 
possession of debt claims against an automobile company (that is, 
through being able to buy its product); you are wealthy, in the 
physical sense, only when you are wearing a car out through use.
<p>
Let us put this question of debt in another form. The population 
of this country during the past century has increased as the 
square of time, production as the cube, total debt as to the 
fourth power, and available energy as to the eighth power. You are 
putting your goods `in hock' faster than you make them. Note now 
this peculiarity about debt: The more use we make of it the more 
we have. This is in complete violation of the basic laws of 
physics which state that the more we use of physical things the 
less we have of them.
<p>
Today, with over 200 billion dollars of total debt in this 
country, we find ourselves owing four times per capita as much as 
we did in 1895 and sixteen times as much total according to one of 
our economists. Do not forget that in 1893, 1907, and 1920 we had 
write-downs of this total debt, but its rate of growth is 
inclusive of all the write-downs, and the debt continues to mount 
thus continually throwing the system out of balance.
<p>
How then is it proposed to handle a Continental setup wherein the 
production of physical wealth has passed from the direction of one 
process to that of another?
<p>
The Price System goes back to remote history. We have had 
variations of it for thousands of years. Russia today operates 
under a Price System, even if it has eliminated private enterprise 
and commercial initiative. Its mechanics of exchange and its 
evaluation procedure are on the same basis as those of the United 
States--it has internal bonds, corporation charters, corporation 
stock; it pays wages and salaries and buys and sells on a 
commodity valuation basis. These things cannot exist without the 
Price System--from which Russian communism believed it had escaped. 
Furthermore, Russia had to call upon the outside world for 
technical assistance in the introduction and use of new 
machinery--the foundation of the new social mechanism she wished to 
set up. Unfortunately, a great part of this machinery was sold to 
Russia by businessmen who were anxious to unload stocks of this 
equipment already obsolete. Tractors that were made to sell to the 
backlot farmer of 140 acres should never have been sold to the 
gigantic farms of this new state. But Russia is learning her 
lesson and doubtless by now is rectifying these errors.
<p>
If you plot the growth of population on any given area subject to 
a high-energy consumption, then you must also plot the growth of 
all energy-consuming devices on that area--for this reason: The 
only distinction man possesses functionally, the one thing which 
differentiates him functionally from all other species, is his 
capacity to design and construct <em>organic extensions</em>, that is to 
say, energy consuming devices independent of himself and capable 
of operating at high capacity with a minimum of human labor and 
attention. Under the compulsion of this technological development 
our modern world has reached a point where a laissez-faire economy 
can no longer be maintained. It is essential that we know the rate 
of growth each and every energy consuming device upon any given 
continental area if we are to operate successfully the physical 
equipment of that area at an energy consumption of 150,000 
kilogram-calories per capita per day. The more energy we consume 
per capita, the greater the need for a change in the methods of 
control--exactly as in the change from an oxcart to an express 
train. The social mechanism of today has advanced to an order of 
magnitude far beyond the log cabin stage of our ancestors; the 
methods of control must be adjusted thereto.
<p>
Technocracy points out that these problems, if not solved, will 
lead to a situation of increasing gravity, possibly terminating in 
a secondary crisis. Attempts to balance our budget, to reduce 
expenditures on a downward curve, will simply mean less employment 
than before with a resulting decrease in purchasing power, and we 
will be compelled finally to such devices as debt moratoriums, 
debt holidays, inflation, and a free-for-all race as to who can 
create debt the fastest.
<p>
How long this can go on we do not know. We did not create the 
situation; we are not responsible for it. Machinery and power 
procedures are not guilty of the present situation on this 
Continent; neither are the engineer, the technologist, and the 
scientist. What we do know is that the past three years have been 
more conducive to social thinking than any similar period in our 
history, for it would seem that only under such conditions do we 
achieve some lucid intervals in our way of social thought.
<p>
We cannot push our industrial situation much beyond the point it 
has now reached. We have today a `technological backlog' 
overhanging this country which makes our material backlog resemble 
a backyard woodpile. Yet, thanks to the prevailing interference 
control of the Price System and its corollary, debt creation, we 
can use only a small portion of that technological backlog. A new 
system will have to be put into effect in order that the things 
which science and technology have developed may come into full 
social usage. Such usage is not possible where you are looking for 
the earliest possible means of creating debt faster against others 
than they can create it against you, and it is just this procedure 
which is necessitated by the Price System under which we operate 
our society. If you cannot maintain a preferential position in 
creating debt claims then you do not stay in business; you go out 
of it. This is not the fault of the individual debt merchant or 
businessman; he is no more rapacious than any other individual or 
group in this country, hut under the setup he is compelled to play 
the game that way. Granted a different setup, the rules of the 
game would be different. Technocracy is pointing out that social 
change will necessitate a new set of rules.
<p>
Social change, in the sense of change in the rate of energy 
conversion, was not inaugurated until the advent of the scientist, 
the engineer, and the technologist. The meal which we have had 
here tonight and the microphone before which I am now speaking are 
symbolic of two entirely different processes--the meal of a process 
which has not appreciably changed in seven thousand years, and the 
microphone of one introduced by modern technology. Food is still 
served with man as a transport animal with antiquated combustion 
methods still used to cook it; yet here before us is a delicate 
instrument through which the technologist puts me into direct 
communication with the people of this Continent. There is no 
reason why the meal could have not been served without human 
aid--no technical reason that is; financially, yes: It would not be 
sufficiently profitable to serve it so, and the capital investment 
would be too high.
<p>
Given a continuance of the present rates of growth of energy 
consumption, we can see no hope of social advance under the Price 
System and its democratic political sponsorship. These things 
contain nothing suitable for dealing with the problems in hand. 
They have no methodology except that of debt creation and this is 
not sufficient for a high-energy civilization. Therefore, 
Technocracy insists that unless a procedure is developed whereby 
we can accurately measure and know the rate of growth of all 
energy-consuming devices on this Continent as a function of time, 
and unless all production and distribution sequences are operated 
on what is known as the balanced-load (which means a minimum of 
deviation), then we shall rapidly approach the end of social 
stability and the beginning of chaos on this Continent.
<p>
I wish to note here a very interesting thing which has come out of 
the work and activities of Technocracy--one of the strangest social 
and political realignments in history. For the first time we are 
witnessing an alignment on the basis of functional capacity, so 
that now we discover the liberal (that last resort of the 
incompetent and stupid), the debt merchant, and the communist, 
fighting together in defense of a system of advantage. We can but 
wish them well, hoping that the company of each is pleasing to the 
others, and we reiterate that, unless the physical factors of society on 
this Continent are brought under control, and that very soon, 
these strangely assorted companion-at-arms will have little or no 
solace save the mud of the last ditch wherein they now struggle so 
valiantly.
<p>
Technocracy has little more to say except that it proposes to 
carry on, hoping that in the near future it may be able to bring 
out its first definite reports on how this Continent has 
functioned in the past century. It may be that social conditions 
are moving faster than we think, that they are even more serious 
than we have claimed. We do not know. Suffice it to say that if 
swiftly moving conditions do prevent our work from becoming known, 
they cannot prevent the work from continuing. That we have enemies 
and encounter hostility is clear enough, but we prefer to be known 
by the enemies we have made, for in their character and motives 
they exhibit an unparalleled functional incapacity.
<p>
Thus it comes about that Technocracy is not greatly concerned with 
replying to its critics. It does not have to. Conditions are 
determining the rate at which we are moving: Technocracy can 
afford to work and wait: no other organization on this Continent 
can. If we are correct, then we have carved out for ourselves one 
of the biggest tasks in history (and we will die in harness). If 
we are wrong, then we have been merely human. We can leave it at 
that, in the full knowledge that conditions in the next few years 
will decide who is correct.
<p>
Technocracy has no theory of the assumption of power; it is not 
concerned with going any particular place. It merely observes the 
present direction of social forces, striving to obtain a clear and 
unified picture of what is happening on this Continent. What is to 
come is for the future to tell. We wish everybody a happy landing,
and close with the affirmation that Technocracy will stand its
ground. For the rest, we will leave it to tomorrow.
