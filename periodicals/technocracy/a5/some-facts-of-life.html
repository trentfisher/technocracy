The persistence with which the moulders of our
public opinion in the press keep reminding themselves and their public
of the fallaciousness, not 
to say the perniciousness of the, Technocratic doctrines
reminds one strongly of the little boy trying bravely to
keep up his courage in the dark by constantly reassuring
himself, ``I ain't sk-keered.'' It seems that such a
number of things tend, to remind the gentlemen of the
press of something or other Technocracy says, that they
find it quite impossible to pretend it into oblivion.
<P>
We have, for example, the little matter of technological
unemployment, which, in spite of the application of
the most potent of witchcraft by our very best medicine
men in an effort to conjure it out of existence, appears
to be with us yet.
<P>
Lest there still be confusion on this point, let us review the
pertinent facts:
<P>
Every piece of machinery introduced since the beginning of the use of
tools has resulted in some job or
other's requiring fewer man-hours for its performance
than was previously the case. It was for that purpose
that the tools were developed and introduced in the
first place. In the industrial growth of North America
new tools and machines were introduced but slowly at
first. There came the steam engine, then steamships
and railroads. There was the cotton gin, the reaper,
and better plows. Man-hours were displaced in communication when the
telegraph, and later the telephone,
superseded the pony express. Finally, during the last
fifty years, the whole works has blossomed forth into
the finest and most complex array of industrial equipment ever seen by
the eyes of man. And without exception each and every one of these
developments has
resulted in the doing of the job in hand with fewer
man-hours than was ever before the case.
<P>
<H3>Jobs and Technology</H3>
<P>
Now where does all this lead us?  To more jobs, or
more jobless?  The answer is, both; first the one, and
then the other. In the pioneer days there were more
than enough jobs for all, a situation that was met in part
by the raising of families of a dozen children or more,
and by the wholesale importation of cheap foreign labor.
It is true that even at that time job. were being eliminated; but, for
the period from the Civil War to the
World War, industrial production wag increasing at
about 5% per annum, while population was growing at
only about 3%, and so, for that period, the birth rate
of new jobs exceeded the death rate of old ones. It is
true that the birth of new industries for that period
and the expansion of old ones created more jobs than
the introduction of new labor-saving equipment eliminated.
The job. created by the automobile industry
did, indeed, exceed those eliminated from the carriage
industry.
<P>
In the period since the World War, however, a different aspect has
presented itself. For reasons financial,
rather than technological, industrial production has been
leveling off in its rate of growth; but, since man-hours
cost a minimum of 20 cents each as compared with
kilowatt-hours at an industrial rate of one cent or less
each, and since a kilowatt-hour will do more work than
10 man-hours, and do it quicker and better, and not
talk back, it has been found to be more profitable to
employ more and more of the latter and correspondingly
less of the former. In other words, technological development with its
introduction of labor-saving machinery is proceeding apace; and,
since so much yet remains
to be done, we venture to suggest that it will continue
to do so into the indefinite future. Since production, in
the meantime, has leveled off, the death rate of old
jobs now exceeds the birth rate of new, resulting in a
corresponding diminution of the total man-hours of
human service required to maintain the operation of
our social mechanism--a state of affairs which we predict will also,
with only temporary reversals, continue
into the indefinite future.
<P>
It must be emphasized that there need be no relationship between a
diminution in the total amount of
necessary human labor and of unemployment. The former
is a direct consequence of technological advance; the
latter results solely from human stupidity. Rationally
approached, technological advance will continue to
lighten human burdens. For a given number of total
man-hours per year to be expended, any number of
men one wishes to name may be employed, provided the
working day be made short enough. It is conceivable
that the technological advance might continue to such
a point that, in order not to have an army of unemployed,
the length of the working day wold have to
be reduced, to five, or even three, hours per day, and it
still be necessary to pay for the shorter day an amount
equal to or greater than what is now being paid for a
day of eight or ten hours.
<P>
Of course such a state of affairs would be disturbing,
for it would strike at the root of one of our fondest
American illusions, namely, that a man somehow earns
what he receives. Should our citizens who perform
socially necessary functions reach a state wherein they
were paid a handsome standard of living for relatively
small expenditure of effort on their part, they might
possibly put on airs and pretend, that they were as good
as bankers and others who perform no socially necessary
function, and who allow themselves graciously to be
served. This would be very detrimental to our great
American institutions, and so is not to be countenanced
if any convenient alternative can be discovered.
<P>
<H3>Getting ``Wise''</H3>
<P>
Such an alternative exists in practice in the form of
the dole, the CCC concentration camps, and the numerous work projects
wherein, under the guise of philanthropy,
a very large percentage of American citizens
are coerced into donating their services in return for a
pittance.
<P>
Of course, we are neither praising nor blaming individuals.
We are only observing that any social administration
that is incompetent to do better for the
welfare of its citizens under circumstances of potential
plenty has little to be said in its favor, and may possibly
be on its way out.
<P>
But one of the more hopeful things about the human
animal is that, no matter how slow and painful the process
may be, he can learn, and that this learning is a
unidirectional and nonreversible process. Thus, 12
million or more human beings who for various fractions
of the past five years have been in the army of the
unemployed, and 20 million more American citizens on
relief, who prior to 1929 formed the nucleus of the
great American sucker class so indispensable to ``normal''
business, will never be the same again. Evidence of a
painful stirring of intelligence is to be observed in the
unrest and dissatisfaction of the victims with the pittance
of the dole and the sweatshop rates of pay on
work relief.
<P>
There are those who like to describe this state of
affairs as ``the breaking down of our public morale,''
``the expression of gross ingratitude,'' or ``biting the
hand that feeds them.'' What it actually means, however,
is that the suckers are now getting ``wise'' to the fact
that their plight is entirely the consequence of
wholesale incompetence in the management of a social
mechanism whose productive equipment is virtually tugging at the leash
for action.
<P>
They are getting wise to the fact that 12 million
American citizens unemployed and 20 million more on
relief are not going to be starved to death, nor are they
going to be mistreated indefinitely. They realize that
by far the greater part of the so-called ``work'' relief
projects are the nature of a sham and an hypocrisy--a
pretense at doing useful work, when what is actually
wanted is some way of keeping people busy without
there being any useful production to show for it.
Witness the road work wherein picks and shovels are
employed while nearby steam shovels are allowed to remain
idle. Why not pay the men for remaining idle and
let the steam shovel dig the dirt? That, of course, would
violate our folkways, requiring that one at least pretend
to work for what he receives.
<P>
Why not take over factories and put the unemployed
to work producing clothing for themselves?  Why not
take a part of the money used for home relief and establish soup
kitchens wherein the destitute could have
free at any time a substantial meal, well cooked and
served?  These, of course, would constitute competition
with ``legitimate business.''
<P>
The unemployment and relief problem is with us yet.
It has grown out of its diaper stage and is beginning to
step out in long pants. <em>Whether or not they bite the
hand that is feeding them, whether or not they display,
the proper attitude of gratitude and deference, and
whether they work or whether they don't work, 32
million Americans now unemployed or on relief, and as
many more as may be added in time, are going to continue to be fed.</em>
<P>
<H3>A Sequence of Reasons</H3>
<P>
And then there is the little matter of finance, upon
which the Technocrats have had a thing or two to say
from time to time.  In spite of the sanctimonious air
with which such things are usually discussed, one may
as well realize sooner or later that all finance is a game
of paper and bookkeeping, played according to prescribed
and arbitrary rules.  One may as well know that
if all the gold, all the coin, and all the U.S. currency
(paper with some printing on it) in the United States
were added together, the total would amount to only
slightly more than 9 billion dollars. He might know
that when banks show deposits totaling 50 billions of
dollars there is nothing more tangible to show for it
than some entries in the bankers' books. He might know
that when one wishes to make a million dollars, he does
so principally by the printing of some papers (bonds,
stocks, etc.) and selling these to a sucker public. One
may make money by working. He may earn one, ten,
or even fifty dollars per day--but nobody ever earned
million dollars by working, and it is doubtful that
anyone ever will.  Amounts of millions and of billions
of dollars are entirely a matter of paper manipulation,
not of physical work.
<P>
It is this latter point that is commonly ignored by
those who are continually beating the big bass drum
about the balancing of the Federal budget. The Federal
Government for the last several years has been
forking out money at the rate of several billions
of dollar per year in excess of the amount which it takes in.
it will be remembered that when this practice was initiated
industry was pretty well shut down, the banks
were closed, and business men generally were somewhat jittery.
<P>
The reason industry had shut down was that people
were not buying goods. The reason they were not buying
goods was that industry had not paid them enough
money. The reason industry had not paid them enough
money was that it could have the work done cheaper
by machinery. But, be that as it may, what was supposed
to be needed to start industry was money in the
hands of the consumer. This money was supplied by
the Federal Government, and it had its virtue in the
fact that it was not collected from anybody. It was
simply created out of thin air.
<P>
<H3>The Governmental Dilemma</H3>
<P>
Following this shot in the arm, industry perked up;
and, since the injection has been repeated each succeeding
year with a slight increase of dosage each time,
industry has succeeded in reaching a level about halfway
between the 1929 level of production and the low
of 1932.
<P>
In consequence of all this, the Bourbons, who never
learn and never forget, began to feel their oats, and to
holler about balancing the budget, apparently little realizing
that balancing a budget by any other method than
that of lifting the tops off of all big incomes would in
short order shut down the county tighter than it has
ever been shut down before.
<P>
On the other hand, one may well wonder what the
outcome will be if the Government debt continues to
mount by 4 to 5 billions of dollars per year and loud
noises from the same quarters as those aforementioned
inform us that it will be recollected in taxes. This is
very frightful to contemplate if one ever stops to
consider that it is impossible. If the Government has
to go into debt to supply the purchasing power necessary
to prevent industrial paralysis, consider how much
more emphatic the paralysis would be if it reversed the
process and began collecting to pay back debts from a
national purchasing power already insufficient to maintain
industrial operation.
<P>
So there is the Governmental dilemma: shut-down if
the budget is balanced, and eventual exhaustion of Federal
credit followed by shut-down if it is not.
<P>
In any case, no one with an income of less than
$10,000 per year need be frightened at the possibility of
ever having to help pay to any great extent the expanding
Federal debt, for if such is ever seriously attempted
we may rest assured that it will be an experiment that
will be short and possibly dirty.
<P>
<H3>The Declining Interest Rate</H3>
<P>
One of the more fundamental rules by which the
financial game is played is to the effect that money
invested should draw interest; that is, that $100 invested
now should at the end of one year accrue to the amount
of, say, $105. Thus, all the money invested in the stocks
and bonds ostensibly representing industry is expected
to yield a return to its owners in accordance with this
rule. Since most of this 5% is reinvested, it follows
that the total monetary capital structure of industry must
increase by an amount of something like 5% per annum
or faster (depending upon how fast new debt, or
``money,'' is created out of thin air in the meantime).
The very maintenance of a 5% interest rate necessitates
that this be true.
<P>
If, at the same time, industrial production expands at
a similar rate of growth, there exists a 1:1 correspondence
between the debt structure and physical production.
Expansion of industry affords a field of new investment
for the expanding debt structure while prices remain
relatively stable.
<P>
Such, it may be recalled, has been the case of American
industry for the period from the Civil War to the
World War. Industry was expanding at about 5% per
annum, the debt structure expanded, and prices and the
interest rate remained relatively stable.
<P>
After the World War industrial production failed to
keep pace, and its curve has since been progressively
flattening out. Investments were forced into foreign
debts, ``favorable'' trade balances installment selling at
home, and pure paper.  While, by such methods, the
growth of the debt structure was maintained after
fashion, it is quite obvious that if new fields for
investments due to an expanding industry are not forthcoming,
then one either ceases to invest entirely, or else
pays more money for the same old stocks and bonds (or
perhaps some new ones) from existing industry. Since
profits are dependent upon production, it is obvious that
profits from industry as a whole cannot more than temporarily
expand unless production expands correspondingly.
<P>
Therefore, <em>the total return of capital investments into
industry must be geared to industrial production.</em> If the
price level is kept constant the yield will decline because
of more money being invested in order to share a fixed
dividend; if the price level is increased the paper interest
rate can be maintained but the goods a dollar will buy
will correspondingly decline. In either case the net result
is the same: <em>With a non-expanding industry the
interest rate in equivalence of real goods must continue
to decline.</em>
<P>
In the light of the foregoing, it is informative to note
that, according to the Bulletin of the Federal Reserve
Board, the yield on conservative investments -- U. S.
long term bonds -- since 1919 has declined as follows:
<P>
<table border="1">

  <tr><td>1919</td><td>4.62%</td><td>1928</td><td>3.33%</td></tr><h6></h6>
  <tr><td>1920</td><td>5.32</td> <td>1929</td><td>3.60</td></tr><h6></h6>

  <tr><td>1926</td><td>3.68</td> <td>1935</td><td>2.70 (approx)</td></tr><h6></h6>
  <tr><td>1927</td><td>3.34</td></tr><h6></h6>
</table>
<P>
In other words, the interest rate is declining toward
zero and the liquidity of the banks and other financial
institutions is approaching 100% -- another trend which,
with only temporary reversals, we predict will likely
continue indefinitely.
<P>
The implications to the Price System game of a zero
interest rate are many and significant. It means the
disruption of banking and of the insurance companies. It
means the withdrawal of the principal means of support
of endowed institutions such as large universities.
It means that people who have been accustomed to easy
living from the return on their investments may have
to join the more ordinary mortals already on relief.
<P>
In situations of this sort we must always keep in
mind, the rather probable possibility of solving our domestic
difficulties through the subterfuge of promoting
a nice friendly war with somebody. Consider the advantages:
there would be an industrial boom, turning
out munitions. By one move the unemployment and
relief problems would be solved by putting the abler
members in the army (and hoping they would get shot),
and the remainder to work in the war industries. War
profits would follow, new fields for investment would
open up, and even the interest rate might be jacked up
a little. And a big time would be had by all--who lived
through it in one piece.
<P>
Then after that, the deluge!
<P>
But where, you ask, does all this lead to? Simply to
``wising'' you up to the fact that you can't get blood
out of a turnip. It is no longer fun to be fooled; the
time is fast approaching when you will have to know
some of the facts of life.
