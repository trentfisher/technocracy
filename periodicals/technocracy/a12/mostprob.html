<P>
As far back as we have record and doubtless
farther, one of the greatest concerns of the human
race has been the problem of what is going to
happen in the future. So great has been this concern
that in most places and times there has existed a separate
priestly class whose special function was to make predictions and to
give advice, for a consideration, to the
officers of state and the leaders of business concerning
the probable outcome of any venture that might be embarked upon.
<P>
In the days of the Old Testament it was the prophets
who assumed this priestly role. In ancient Greece the
priests of the famous oracle at Delphi were oftentimes
the principal advisors to the rulers of the state. In the
Middle Ages the astrologers came into vogue, and no
medieval court was properly appointed without its court
astrologer, who also in many instances was the professor
of astrology in the local university.
<P>
Today, notwithstanding the fact that there are still
a dozen or so practicing astrologers listed in the New
York classified telephone directory, astrology has fallen
pretty well into disrepute. Instead of professors of
astrology in our modern state-owned and privately endowed universities,
we have professors and departments
of economics; and in the place of the court astrologer, or
the priests at the temple of Delphi, we now have the
Brookings Institution.
<P>
The devices of official prognosticators also have varied
considerably with time. God descended and delivered
his message to the biblical prophets. The priests at
Delphi uttered oracular noises while being overcome by
the noxious fumes emanating from the hot springs underneath the
temple. The tools of the astrologer consisted
of such matters as the `positions of the planets,' the `horoscope,'
and `the signs of the zodiac.' The economist has
the `law of supply and demand,' the `niggardliness of
nature' and the `insatiability of human desire.' He believes in `sound
money,' the restoration of `confidence,'
and that one can depend upon the `natural forces of recovery' to
restore things to `normal' conditions. And
above all it is by means of the `business cycle' that he is
enabled to predict with supreme confidence what is going
to happen.
<P>
It was on the basis of the business cycle that economists were able to
tell us in 1930 and 1931 that prosperity was `just around the corner.'
In January 1936,
when industrial production was on its way up as a result
of government spending, the economists, by a review of
the business cycle, were able to show that everything was
turning out exactly according to Hoyle, for recovery
from the depression of 1873 had come 1879, from that
of 1893 in 1899, and from that of 1907 in 1912--within
five or six years in each instance. Finally, in early 1938,
after industry had undergone the most spectacular shutdown in American
history due to the curtailment of
government spending, it was shown that the business
cycle runs on a twenty year period (for example: 1873,
1893, 1907, 1921, and 1929), but that there always has
been a mid-term `recession.'
<P>
Probably no single subject in all economic literature
has been written on more lavishly than the business
cycle.' Libraries exist upon this subject alone, ranging in
technicality from the most elementary discussions, to
treatises bristling with advanced mathematics; yet for
the last ten years no instance has been observed of an
accurate prediction, by means of this method, of any
major event in the future, although its adaptability in explaining
events that are already past appears unlimited.
<P>
The whole fallacy of all such discussions seems to lie
in a failure to comprehend, or perhaps to define the concept of
`cycle' and that of `business.'
<P>
In the first place one needs to consider just what is the
meaning of the word `cycle.' The word originally implied the rotation
of a wheel.  When a wheel rotates it
goes through a series of successive positions and finally
returns to exactly its original position. If rotation continues with
uniform angular velocity, each of these successive positions of the
wheel is repeated at equal intervals of time.
<P>
Now if we project the position of a point on the rim
of the wheel, viewed in the plane of the wheel, upon a
piece of paper moving at uniform velocity parallel to the
axis of the wheel, we obtain the wave shaped graph of
Figure 1, known as a <em>sine curve</em>. This curve may be
taken as the type example of all cyclical phenomena. The
horizontal axis represents time and the up and down
motion represents some quantity which varies cyclically
with time. From this, it is easy to generalize and to
define as a cyclical phenomenon any phenomenon which
goes through any sequence of events, returns to its
initial state, and then repeats indefinitely, the same
sequence of events at equal intervals of time.
<p>
<img src="mp-f1.gif" WIDTH=290 HEIGHT=151 ALT="[graph]">
<P>
When the variation with time of any quantity that
changes cyclically is plotted as a graph, it can be shown
that no matter what the shape of this graph may be, it
can always be obtained by the addition of a suitable
number of simple sine curves like that of Figure 1 but of
different periods (time of a complete cycle) and of different
amplitudes (radius of generating circle).
<P>
In Figure 2 curve C represents a cycle of period T<sub>3</sub>
which is obtained by adding the sine curves A and B of
periods T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub>, respectively.
<P>
<img src="mp-f2.gif" WIDTH=290 HEIGHT=230 alt="[graph of combined cyclical phenomenon">
<P>
The most fundamental thing in all cyclical phenomena
is the element of repetition at equal intervals of time.
<em>Cyclical phenomena repeat themselves identically at equal
time intervals</em>.  Approximately cyclical phenomena repeat themselves
approximately. For example, the temperature in the city of New York
rises and falls in an
approximately cyclical manner during the course of a
year. The pendulum of a clock swings back and forth in
a cyclical manner. Astronomical bodies, the sun, the
moon, and the planets, move about the heavens in a
cyclical manner.
<P>
It is this element of repetition in a cyclical phenomenon
which makes it easily possible to predict the future. Once
a phenomenon is observed to vary cyclically, and the
sequence of events for one cycle, and the period, are
determined, it is possible to predict what its state will be
at any given time in the future. Thus astronomers predict the
positions of the sun, the moon, and the planets
into the indefinite future. Eclipses are predicted accurately years
before they occur. In approximately cyclical
phenomena approximate predictions may be made. Thus
we may predict freezing weather in Chicago next December, and the
next, and for an indefinite number of Decembers thereafter.
<P>
Coming now to the other essential part of the `business cycle,' we
must investigate what constitutes `business.'  If a business cycle is
to exist, then that means
that some quantity or series of quantities must vary up
and down in a cyclical manner as a function of time.
`Business' is a sort of blanket or undefined term used to
cover loosely a multitude of things. It refers perhaps
more specifically to trade and commerce, but trade and
commerce are a composite of such industrial activities as
agriculture, mining, manufacturing, power production,
transportation, and communication; and all are intimately linked up
with the magnitude of the human population.  Hence to investigate the
changes of `business' it
becomes necessary to investigate the evolution of a whole
industrial complex as a function of time.
<P>
Any human social complex consists of a biological complex of plant and
animal species of which the human
species is only one. Besides this, the human species indulges in an
array of activities of an industrial nature
of varying degrees of complexity. The history or the
evolution of such a social complex may be regarded as
the record of the changes of the several component variables of the
system as a function of time. Whether or
not the system, or any part of it, varies in a cyclical manner, can be
determined only by an investigation of the
behavior of these component variables with time, or else
by the employment of certain basic considerations which
enable us to know the nature of possible variations even
if the exact details are not known. Our concern in the
present discussion is with the past evolution of the social
complex of the North American Continent, though the
actual discussion and the data employed will apply
principally to the United States. This is due to the fact
that the data for the United States are most readily accessible.
Conclusions and methods of reasoning applicable to the United States
are, however, applicable and
valid for the remainder of the area also.
<P>
One of the most important of the variable quantities
in a social complex is population. As remarked before,
the human species is only one of a large number of
biologic species coexisting in the area, other species,
both plant and animal, forming the essential food supply
of the human species.
<P>
Figure 3 is a graph of the growth of the population of
the United States according to the United States census
since the year 1790. It is to be noted that in the entire
history of the United States the population has never
once decreased; it has only increased with time.
<p>
<img src="mp-f3.gif" WIDTH=285 HEIGHT=249 alt="[graph of US population]">
<P>
From a biological point of view this is not surprising,
for it is a well known fact that all biologic species tend to
increase, when environmental circumstances will permit
it, at a geometrical rate with time. That is to say, if
the population doubles in a given number of years, it
will again double within the next same number of years,
and so on. If we study Figure 3 we will observe that
from 1790 to 1860, the population of the United States
doubled every 23 years. This is the same type of increase that
characterizes a sum of money at compound
interest, where the interest is added to the principal continuously as
fast as it accrues. Computation shows that
from 1790 to 1860 the instantaneous rate of growth was
almost exactly 3 percent per annum, compounded continuously.
<P>
Now suppose that this were all we knew about the
population of the United States--that from 1790 to 1860
it had expanded geometrically or exponentially, at 3 percent per
annum, or in such a manner as to double every
23 years. Could we then say anything about the past or
the future of that population? Calculation shows that if
this rate of increase continued for another 454 years after
1860, or until the year 2314 A. D. there would be one
person to every 4 square feet of area in the United States,
which would just barely be standing room, and in another 23 years this
number would be doubled.
<P>
It is obviously physically impossible to support such
a population density on any area, so we are forced to
conclude that no population of any kind--plant or animal
-- can expand geometrically for more than a temporary
period of time.
<P>
Further study of Figure 3 bears this out. The dotted
line curve is the rate of increase of the population in
percent per annum for each ten year period. After the
Civil War this rate, it will be noted, descends rather
sharply toward zero, indicating that although the population is still
increasing its rate of growth is decreasing.
<P>
Another way of getting at the same thing is by means
of the birth-rate and death-rate curves of Figure 4 as
derived from the Statistical Abstract of the United
States. The solid line curve in this figure represents the
number of births per year for each thousand of the population for each
year since 1915. The middle curve is the
number of deaths, per thousand, and the bottom curve
is the excess of births over deaths.
<p>
<img src="mp-f4.gif" WIDTH=285 HEIGHT=235 alt="[graph of birth and death rates]">
<P>
It will be noted that the birth-rate has been falling
since 1915, and that the excess of the birth-rate over the
death-rate has been declining since 1921, being only 6
per thousand in 1934. The present expectancy of life
is about 60 years, so that if the birth-rate and the death-rate were
equal and the population stationary, 1/60th
of each thousand would be born and 1/60th would die
each year, giving a stationary birth-rate and death-rate
of 16.7 per thousand. The birth-rate has already reached
this critical figure and shows every indication of going
below it. If it does, the death-rate must rise as the
present older generation dies off. Almost certainly the
birth-rate and death-rate curves will meet or cross not
later than 1950. 0n this assumption we can estimate
the difference between the two from now until then.
This enables us to compute the increase of the population for each
year between now and 1950. This has been
done and the results are plotted on Figure 3 as the dashed
extension of the population cure. This indicates a peak
population of 134 million persons at about 1950.
<P>
It does not seem likely that this figure could be greatly
upset by any procedure less drastic than an intensive
subsidized program of cannon-fodder production.
<P>
If we follow the population curve in the other direction
we can see that it is also impossible for it to have
expanded at 3 percent per annum for more than a
temporary period in the past. In this case let us consider the
population of the whole world. The present
world population is estimated to be about 2 billion people.
The population of 1800 was approximately a third of
this amount, 0r about 700 million. From geological and
archaeological data it is estimated that the human species
has existed as such for about a million years.
<P>
While we do not know how many people existed a
million years ago, there could not have been fewer than
2 and probably were many more. Neither do we know
just how the population increased, but it probably had
some rises and falls, reaching about 700 million by the
year 1800. Let us suppose, however, that it grew at a
uniform geometric rate from an initial population of 2
and reached the figure of 700 million, one million years
later. How long would it require to double the population at this rate?
This we can solve if we let <var>P</var><sub>0</sub> be the initial
population,
and <var>P</var> that at any later time, <var>t</var>. Then
<P>
<blockquote>
<p align=center>
<var>P</var> = <var>P</var><sub>0</sub><var>e<sup>at</sup></var>    (1)
</blockquote>
<P>
where <var>e</var> is 2.7183, the base of natural logarithms, a is
the rate of increase per year, and t the number of years.
We first solve equation (1) for <var>a</var>, the rate of increase.
Taking logarithms of both sides
<P>
<blockquote>
<p align=center>
log<sub>10</sub><var>P</var> = log<sub>10</sub><var>P</var><sub>0</sub>
+ <var>at</var> log<sub>10</sub><var>e</var>
</blockquote>
<P>
and
<P>
<blockquote>
<p align=center>
<var>a</var> = (log<sub>10</sub><var>P</var> -
                log<sub>10</sub><var>P</var><sub>0</sub>) /
               <var>t</var> log<sub>10</sub><var>e</var>
             = log<sub>10</sub> 3.5 x 10<sup>8</sup> / 10<sup>6</sup> x 0.4343
             = 1.98 x 10<sup>-5</sup>
</blockquote>
<P>
Having thus determined <var>a</var>, we can solve for the time
required for the population to increase 2-fold. This becomes
<P>
<blockquote>
<p align=center>
<var>P</var> / <var>P</var><sub>0</sub> = 2 = <var>e<sup>at</sup></var> (2)
<p align=center>
log<sub>10</sub>2 = <var>at</var> log<sub>10</sub><var>e</var>
<p align=center>
<var>t</var> = log<sub>10</sub>2 / <var>a</var> log<sub>10</sub><var>e</var>
             = .30103 / (1.98 x 10<sup>-5</sup> x 0.4343)
             = 35,000 years
</blockquote>
<P>
Thus we see that this would require a growth rate
such that the population would double in size only once
in 35,000 years, which is about 5 times as long as the
time since the pyramids were built.
<P>
This does not mean that the population actually grew
at this rate, which is a sort of mean rate for the period.
The population doubtless expanded much faster part of
the time (as in the years immediately preceding 1800);
if so it also must have expanded more slowly much of
the remaining time.
<P>
All that has been said of human populations is true
also of all other kinds of organic populations. One of
the great fallacies of the 19th century was the enunciation of the
so-called `Law of Malthus' by the economist
Malthus, first formulated in 1798 and revised a number
of times after 1800. Malthus stated that human populations tend to
increase in geometric ratio with time, but
that the food supply increases only arithmetically. The
real error consisted in failing to recognize that <em>all</em> biologic
species, including those used for human food, tend to increase
geometrically with time, but that the usual state
of any biologic population, excepting those that fluctuate
with the seasons, is stationary. In other words, if we had
a record of the various populations of a biologic complex for a period
of some thousands of years, any rapid
change, either upward or downward, of any population
would be a definitely anomalous phenomenon.
<P>
Malthus apparently was unaware that he was witnessing one of the most
abnormal population changes in the
whole history of the earth, and he made the mistake of
assuming that what he saw was the normal state of affairs.
<P>
This might be of no importance were it not for the
fact that even today, most of our contemporary thinking
is based unknowingly upon the same hidden errors of
Malthus. Not only has the past century been a period
of unprecedented population growth, but it has been even
more spectacular in its industrial expansion.
<P>
Ever since before the dawn of written history the
human species has been accumulating technical knowledge of how to
convert a larger and lager share of
available energy to its own uses. The use of fire, the
domestication of animals, the development of tools, the
development of agriculture, the mining of metals, the
utilization of wind and water power, and the tapping of
the vast stores of the fossil fuels, coal and oil, have been
among the leading successive steps in this long line of
cumulative achievement. Step by step, each of these advances has
disturbed the existing biological equilibrium
in favor of an increase of the human population. This
procession has reached its most spectacular stage of development in
the period since the Civil War. During
this period, not only have populations increased, but so
have a large number of other things--railroads, factories,
automobiles, aeroplanes, radios, and the production of
such minerals as iron, copper, tin, lead, zinc, aluminum,
magnesium, phosphates, potash, coal, and oil.
<P>
So monotonously have these things increased during
our life times that many of us have assumed naively, like
Malthus, that such increase is the `normal' state of affairs,
little realizing that some of the most abnormal events in
all geological history were being witnessed.
<P>
From the Civil War to the World War, for example,
the production of coal doubled every 12 years, increasing
at a rate of 5.9 percent per annum. From 1880 to 1929
the production of oil and gas increased 8.5 percent per
annum, doubling every 8 years. From the Civil War to
the World War the production of all energy--coal, oil,
gas, and water power--increased at the rate of 6.1 percent per annum,
doubling every 11.5 years; the production of pig iron increased at a
rate of 7.4 percent per annum, doubling every 9.5 years.
<P>
Just as we did in the case of population, let us now
see to what extent this state of affairs can be maintained.
In the case of coal, the production of which doubled
every 12 years, we can calculate what the annual production would be
at any given time in the future and
also the cumulative production, assuring this rate of
growth to be maintained. It is estimated that there are
between 3 x 10<sup>12</sup> and 4 x 10<sup>12</sup> tons of coal still
unmined in the United States. Taking a conservative
figure of 3.4 X 10<sup>12</sup> tons, and allowing production to
continue to increase from the year 1900 at 5.9 percent
per year, it would require only 111 years, or to the year
2011 A.D., to exhaust the coal reserves of the United
States. On the other hand, at the present rate of production of about
600 million tons per year, the supply would
last some 4,000 to 6,000 years.
<P>
The same sort of relation is true of oil, the production
of which increased at the rate of 8.5 percent per annum
and reached over a billion barrels per year in 1929.
Since that time it has leveled off, averaging approximately a billion
barrels per year. In this instance the proven
reserves, that is the oil already discovered, amounts only
to about 11 or 12 billions of barrels, or a 10 or 12 year
supply at the present rate of production. The only way
in which this margin can be maintained is by discovery
of new oil at a rate equal to the production. While we
do not know exactly how much oil remains undiscovered,
we do know that it is a limited supply and that for every
barrel of oil taken out of the ground there remains one
less barrel to be produced, and that every new pool discovered
diminishes the undiscovered pools by one.
Furthermore, the easy discoveries have already been
made and only the difficult ones remain. While it is improbable that
all the oil will ever be taken out of the
ground or even discovered, it is certain that the production of oil
will reach one or more peaks and finally decline, reaching ultimately
the limit of zero production.
The time of the beginning of this decline in the United
States is somewhat uncertain, yet it seems doubtful that
it can be postponed any later than 1950 and possibly not
that long.
<P>
Coal and oil are primarily energy resources and the
matter contained is of only secondary importance. In
contrast with energy resources, most mineral resources
are useful for their material content. They differ also in
that the matter contained cannot be destroyed nor removed from the
surface of the earth.  Spectroscopic
analysis shows that almost any specimen of ordinary
rock contains traces of most of the known chemical
elements. The average iron content of rocks of all kinds
is about 5 percent. In the development of material
resources, advantage is taken of the fact that there exist
localities where by one or another geological process certain mineral
substances have become concentrated in
abnormally large amounts.
<P>
Taking iron as an example, rich concentrations of the
mineral hematite (Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) occur in the Lake Superior,
and Birmingham, Alabama iron mining districts. In
the Lake Superior district the rock mined contains 50
percent by weight of iron; the iron content of the Alabama ores is 30
percent. The reason for the difference
is that the nonferrous content, or gangue, in the Lake
Superior district is silica, while in Alabama it is limestone which is
useful in smelting.
<P>
The distribution of iron concentration in the total mass
of minable rock is shown diagrammatically in Figure 5.
The total area of the rectangle represents the total min
able rock. The vertical columns from left to right represent rock
amounts arranged in order of decreasing iron
content from the highest of about 70 percent at the extreme left to
approximately zero at the right. The narrow black strip at the left,
which is shown greatly exaggerated, represents the high concentrations
of iron
that are currently regarded as minable ore. When such
areas are exhausted, which promises to be only a matter
of decades, the lower concentration deposits will have
to be worked at a correspondingly higher energy cost of
extraction.
<p>
<img src="mp-f5.gif" WIDTH=285 HEIGHT=205 alt="[graph of iron ore concentrations]">
<P>
In the use of any material resource a certain fraction
is always inevitably lost. In the case of iron this is
largely through corrosion by oxidation, or through needless scattering as in the case of tin cans which go on
the garbage dump. A large fraction of lead and zinc
are used as paint pigments. All such losses result in a
low concentration dissemination of the resource. This
means that our industrial operations tend to level off
the shaded areas shown in Figure 5. We mine only
the highest peaks of the shaded area and ultimately we
scatter the material so obtained over the region of low
concentration. This causes the surface of the shaded
area to tend, like water, to a level characterized by the
most probable possible state of uniform concentration.
<P>
While Figure 5 is drawn specifically for iron, it may
be taken as representative of all material resources,
which through industrial use are transformed from a
more available and less probable configuration to a more
probable and practically non-available configuration.
<P>
This is indicated in a somewhat different manner in
Figure 6 where the essential elements of the flow-line
of any metal are depicted. The stock of metal in industrial usage may
be thought of as stored in a storage tank
of variable capacity. Metals flow from high-grade deposits by the
process of primary production into the
store-tank of industrial usage. They leave this tank by
wastage or scrap. The scrap may be retrieved and returned along with
primary metals to further industrial
usage. The waste goes to low-concentration dissemination. The annual
gain of the stock of any metal is the
difference between the annual production and the annual waste.
<P>
<img src="mp-f6.gif" WIDTH=285 HEIGHT=174 alt="[graph metal flow]">
<P>
The different types of growth phenomena that we have
been considering are illustrated in Figure 7. A large
number of quantities, we have seen, have increased
geometrically or exponentially with time, over a number
of decades. They have increased according to the law:
<P>
<blockquote>
<p align=center>
<var>P</var> = <var>P</var><sub>0</sub><var>e<sup>at</sup></var>
</blockquote>
<P>
where <var>P</var><sub>0</sub>, is the initial value of the quantity
at time t<sub>0</sub>, <var>P</var>
the magnitude of the quantity <var>t</var> years later, <var>a</var>
the rate of increase per annum, and <var>e</var> the base of natural
logarithms. We have
already seen in the cases of population growth and coal production
that such a rate of
growth is impossible for more than a temporary period,
otherwise the population and the coal produced soon
would exceed all physically possible limits. This qualification is
general. No physical quantity can increase
exponentially for more than a limited period of time
on an earth that is finite and limited in size. All such
growth curves must consequently break away from the
exponential curve and level off.
<P>
<img src="mp-f7.gif" WIDTH=285 HEIGHT=224 alt="[growth curves]">
<P>
In Figure 7, curve <var>A</var> is an exponential curve expanding at a rate 6.4
percent per annum, or doubling every
11 years, which is intermediate between the rate of
growth of the consumption of energy and that of the production of
pig-iron in the United States from the Civil
War till the World War. Physical production, however, has not been
able to keep up the dizzy pace set by
curve <var>A</var>, and it has veered off along the solid line curve.
<P>
In the future, all such quantities must ultimately follow along curves
of the types given by <var>B</var>, <var>C,</var> or <var>D</var>.
Fortunately we do not have to wait in order to know
which of these three classes any given quantity will have
to follow.  <var>B</var> represents all quantities which level off approaching
asymptotically to a maximum; <var>C</var> represents
quantities which level off to some arbitrary level, in general neither
a maximum nor zero; <var>D</var> represents quantities
which pass through one or more maxima and finally approach zero as a limit.
<P>
The development of installed water power in any given
area follows a curve of the type <var>B</var>. We may develop
more and more of the potential water power but we can
never exceed the amount that there is.
<P>
All biologic populations and biologic products, such
as grain, cotton, lumber, meats, leather, wool, etc., follow curves of
the type <var>C</var>. A biologic population rarely
becomes zero (extinct); neither can it increase beyond
certain limits. The normal state of populations, other
than those that fluctuate with the seasons, is stationary.
Periods of rapid change are, as we have seen, definitely
exceptional.
<P>
Finally, to type <var>D</var> belongs the production of all mineral
resources. The fossil fuels, coal and oil, are strictly of
this type. The curve <var>D</var> represents the amount (tons of
coal, barrels of oil, etc.) produced per year. The area
under the curve up to any given time represents the integral or
cumulative production from the beginning to that
date. Since the amount of coal and oil is finite, and the
rate of creation of new coal and oil sensibly zero, it follows that no
matter what the exact shape of the curve <var>D</var>
may be, it must begin at zero and end at zero, and the
total area under it may approach but cannot exceed the
quantity of the resource originally in existence.
<P>
The material resources are also of this sort with this
exception: that it is impossible ever to exhaust a material
resource, so that if production be kept up long enough,
the high-grade deposits will all be obliterated and only
the lean ones remain. When this has gone far enough,
production may cease, or else it is possible, if energy
supplies are available, to continue working the low-grade
deposits indefinitely.
<P>
So far we have spoken only of quantities that for the
last 100 years have been increasing somewhat spectacularly with
time. There are other types of quantities
which have been decreasing throughout that time, due
to progressive changes in the technological processes of
production. Among such declining quantities are the
amount of coal required to produce a kilowatt-hour of
mechanical or electrical energy, the amount of land required to yield
a unit of agricultural produce per year, the
amount of coal per 1000 gross ton-miles of railroad transportation,
and the number of man-hours of human labor
required per unit of output of any industrial product.
<P>
In general we may say that every time we design new
equipment to perform a function formerly done by equipment and
processes of an older design, the new equipment has these essential
properties: its parts move with
a higher frequency, and it requires fewer man-hours of
attention per unit of output than the equipment displaced.
These are, in fact, the reasons for installing the new
equipment.
<P>
It is a perfectly general rule, also, that every time
equipment is made to run faster, its mass and the floor
space it occupies per unit rate of output decrease. For
example, the power plants are installing 3600 r.p.m.
turbo-generators instead of the usual ones turning at
1800 r.p.m. because the faster ones occupy less space
for the same kilowatt rating. The streamlined trains
weigh less than half as much per passenger-mile per
hour as the old fashioned pullmans, and require less than
half as many man-hours per passenger-mile.
<P>
All of these curves which decline with time are, as we
have seen, rate curves of one kind or another, and the
decline occurs in consequence of technological improvement. Associated
with each of these decline curves,
therefore, is some growth curve of the type we have been
discussing. Thus, if <var>Q</var> is some quantity that is being
produced and <var>P</var> its rate of production, then
<P>
<blockquote>
<p align=center>
<var>P</var> = <var>dQ</var> / <var>dt</var>        (3)
</blockquote>
<P>
where <var>dQ</var> is the amount of the quantity produced in the
time <var>dt</var>.
<P>
Now if <var>A</var> is some other quantity such as man-hours or
pounds of coal that depends upon <var>Q</var>, then
<var>dA</var>/<var>dQ</var> is the
amount of <var>A</var> required per unit of <var>Q</var>
produced. Finally, the amount of <var>A</var> per unit of time,
<var>dA</var>/<var>dt</var> is given by
<P>
<blockquote>
<p align=center>
<var>dA</var>/<var>dt</var> =
 (<var>dQ</var> / <var>dt</var>) x
 (<var>dA</var>/<var>dQ</var>) =
 <var>P</var> x (<var>dA</var>/<var>dQ</var>) (4)
</blockquote>
<P>
This is illustrated graphically in Figure 8 where curve
A represents the rate of production <var>P</var> of some quantity;
curve <var>P</var> represents <var>dA</var>/<var>dQ</var>, the amount
of some other quantity required
to produce a single unit of the quantity
represented in curve <var>A</var>; curve <var>C</var> is the product
obtained by multiplying the quantities of curves <var>A</var> and
<var>B</var> together,
year by year, giving the variations with time of the
quantity <var>dA</var>/<var>dt</var> of equation (4).
<P>
<img src="mp-f8.gif" WIDTH=285 HEIGHT=186 alt="[graph]">
<P>
In an early stage when the rate-of-production curve
<var>A</var> is near zero, the product curve <var>C</var> is also near zero.
As the production increases, the product also increases
but not so rapidly, since one member of the product
curve <var>C</var> is declining. Finally, as the ordinates of the
curve <var>B</var> get smaller and the curve <var>A</var> levels off, the
product reaches a maximum and declines.
<P>
These relations have been stated abstractly in this
manner so as to make them applicable to a number of
things that vary in this way. If the curve <var>A</var> represents
production and curve <var>B</var> the man-hours required per unit
produced, then curve <var>C</var> represents the total man-hours
per year in that industry. Curve <var>A</var> may represent the
annual-production of kilowatt-hours of electrical energy,
and curve <var>B</var> the pounds of coal per kilowatt-hour. Then
curve <var>C</var> would be the total coal consumed in the production
of electric 
power. Curve <var>A</var> might be the number of bales of cotton
produced in each year and curve
<var>B</var> the average number of acres required to produce one
bale. The curve <var>C</var> would then represent the total number of
acres each year required for the entire crop.
Again curve <var>A</var> may represent the annual production of
a manufacture industry and curve <var>B</var> the area of floor
space or mass of equipment required each year for that
rate of production.
<P>
There are many other examples of this sort, but in
all cases the production represented by curve <var>A</var> must,
for reasons already discussed, level off. The quantity
of coal, of man-hours, of land area, of floor space, or of
metal in machinery, as the case may be, per unit produced or per unit
rate of production in consequence of
technological improvement must decline. Consequently
the total man-hours per year, coal per year, land area,
floor space, and metal tied up in machinery will in each
instance reach a peak and thereafter decline, as indicated
by curve <var>C</var>.
<P>
If we now sum up what we have been over, some
results of profound significance should become apparent.
The history of the United States is the record of the
variation with time of a large number of separate
biological and industrial quantities. Many of these
qualities have increased exponentially until about the
World War, and have since then levelled off. No
physical quantity can continue to expand exponentially
with time for more than a temporary period. In the
United States and the North American Continent the
period of exponential expansion with present energy resources has
already passed.
<P>
The last hundred years have been characterized by
the most spectacular technological improvements in history. These have
led to a continuous decline of such
quantities as man-hours per unit produced, pounds of
coal per kilowatt-hour, acres per bale of cotton per year,
pounds of metal per unit rate of industrial output, area
of factory and office floor space per unit rate of manufacture and
accounting. Furthermore, there is no indication or likelihood of there
being a cessation of these
technological trends, in the calculable future.
<P>
The combination of these two factors, the leveling
off of population and production curves, and the decline
of the factors enumerated, leads necessarily to a maximum and then a
decline of total man-hours of employment per year, land in
cultivation, floor space for both
factory and office, and the metals in active industrial use.
Furthermore, most of these maxima have already occurred and the
decline in the factors enumerated is
already under way and has been in some instances
(employment for example) for nearly 20 years.
<P>
This means decreasing labor for human beings, a contraction of floor
space and cultivated farm land, a saving
in the rate of exhaustion of non-replaceable resources
such as coal and oil, and a curtailment of primary production of the
common metals such as iron and copper
since the scrap of old equipment becomes more nearly
ample to build the new without a drain on ore reserves
by primary production.
<P>
Notwithstanding some millions of dollars worth of
propaganda to the contrary indulged in by the leaders
of business in the form of paid advertising and by the
presidents of some of our leading technological institutions of
learning, these trends are in no wise to be reversed by any scientific
or technological procedure, or
by any hypothetical `new industry'. The growth curves
we have discussed represent an integration of essentially
all industries old and new--the wagon industry, the
automobile industry, and the aeroplane industry.
<P>
The very period during which technological progress
has been the fastest--that since the World War
is the period of the lowest rate of industrial expansion
in the last 100 years of American history.
<P>
Returning to our friends, the economists, and their
`business cycles', it may be noted that at no time in American history
has the ensemble of events that go to make
up what is commonly regarded as `business' ever repeated
itself cyclically or otherwise. To repeat the events of
1920 it would be necessary to put the population back
to its 1920 state; to go back to the 1920 models of
automobiles, highways, and other equipment; and to restore to the ground all the coal, oil, and metals that have
been removed since that date.
<P>
Since any of these things are manifestly impossible,
then let us recognize that we are dealing with phenomena
that do not and cannot repeat themselves, and that the
events of 1873, of 1893, and of 1907 were essentially
and fundamentally different from the events of 1938.
And the events of 1940 will in no wise be determined
upon the basis of what happened in 1875.
<P>
The people of the North American Continent cannot
travel the road travelled by the peoples of Europe, nor
can they travel the road which they have covered in the
past. Neither the astrologers, the economists, the politicians, the
liberals, the reformers, nor the radicals can
conjure out of their crystal balls the blue print of a New
America. Only in the trends of modern technology and
in the biologic processes taking place on this Continent
can the most probable future be read.
<P>
Technocracy is the science of social technology; as
such, it has determined the next most probable state of
human affairs on the North American Continent.
