<P>
There was a time in American history, and still is in local areas,
when one of the principal popular
pastimes was arguing about the Bible. These discussions were of the
nature of a game in which one
contestant stated some proposition and then quoted the
appropriate Scripture to prove it. The other contestant
dissented strongly from the proposition as stated, and
proceeded to disprove it by quoting some other equally
authoritative but completely contradictory Scripture.
The fundamental premise upon which the validity of this
game depended, and which was accepted implicitly by
all parties to the discussion, was that all portions of the
Bible were strictly and literally correct and not to be
questioned.
<P>
This ``literal infallibility'' clause led to so many absurdities and
contradictions to everyday physical fact,
that there arose a reform school composed of those who
Insisted that the game could be played with much more
subtlety and sophistication if the ``literal infallibility''
clause were removed from the basic premise and a new
clause adopted stating that it was the ``spirit'' rather
than the ``letter'' of the Scriptures which was infallible.
The game as played with this latter variation was infinitely more
flexible and varied than its predecessor, for
it then permitted each contestant to decide for himself
just what the ``spirit'' in the case might be.
<P>
If anyone questioned or refused to accept the fundamental premise,
either in its primitive or revised form,
upon which the validity of the game depended, the game
then was seen to be merely a childish and relatively
harmless pastime, having no more significance than any
other equally childish pastime.
<P>
Gradually it became customary for the better informed to refuse to
accept the basic premise of the Scripture-quoting game,
and to look with some disdain upon those
who still insisted upon playing it. The result was that
the game gradually lost prestige and passed out of vogue.
<P>
Recently, however, it has been succeeded by an exactly analogous game
played by the same rules except that
the Constitution has been substituted for the Bible, and
the argument centers around whether or not any Federal
activity is in accordance with or contrary to the Federal
Constitution. just as in the case of the Bible, the basic
premise upon which the validity of the whole discussion
rests is the infallibility of the Constitution for meeting
any conceivable social needs that may arise in the United
States at any time in the indefinite future. But since,
just as in the case of the Bible, a ``literal infallibility''
clause leads to too many obvious and immediate contradictions, it has
been found necessary, in order not to
have the game disrupted prematurely, to substitute the
``spirit'' for the ``letter'' in the basic premise. With this
substitution the fundamental premise now reads: It is
entirely within the spirit of the Constitution of the United
States for the Federal Government to take whatever
action it may deem necessary to meet any present or
future social emergency that may arise in the United
States.
<P>
Granting this premise, the game then consists of some one's saying
that some action or other is entirely in accordance with the ``spirit''
of the Constitution, and then
invoking this ``spirit'' along with some of the spirits of
the founding fathers to prove the point. The opposition
then makes its rejoinder by calling upon its particular
set of pet ``spirits'' to prove the converse to be true,
and so on <em>ad nauseum</em>.
<P>
<H3>Big League Constitution Quoters</H3>
<P>
As compared with the game of Constitution Quoting, the game of Bible
Quoting was relatively primitive and
naive, for the latter persisted largely as a pure sport for
sport's sake, in that none of the players were pecuniarily
rewarded for their efforts.  Just as in other sports where
it has long since been learned that, properly managed,
baseball, football, wrestling, and fist-fighting may be
made highly remunerative regardless of who wins or
loses the bout, the game of Constitution Quoting has
long since left the sad-lots and entered the Big League
stage as one of the greatest and most remunerative of
our national spectacles--the Big League teams being
composed of the most facile Constitution quoters that
can be found, with a constant stream of new recruits
coming up from the sand-lot teams throughout the land.
Also, as with baseball or prize fighting, it is a matter of
comparative indifference to the contestants themselves
who wins or loses, since both the winning and the losing
teams are rewarded handsomely <em>provided only that the
game itself goes on</em>.
<P>
Just as in the case of the Bible, the game of Constitution Quoting
depends for its validity upon neither side's,
and least of all the paying customers', ever questioning
the fundamental premise. For what would happen to
such a game should the question be asked, ``What can
any document drawn up by a group of relatively ignorant
politicians, farmers, soldiers, petty shop-keepers, and
usurers, representing thirteen small colonies of villages
and farms along the Atlantic Coast, have to do with the
problems of operation of a social complex extending from
the Atlantic to the Pacific Coast, with a population of
150 million people depending upon the unceasing operation of over one
billion horse power of prime movers
for the production of their daily bread?'' And yet the
only question particularly pertinent at the moment is
this.
<P>
If, on the other hand, one directs his attention away from the
national pastime of Constitution Quoting and
considers the social problems themselves, he finds them
be, though somewhat complex in detail, quite fundamentally simple as a
whole. The problem is essentially
one of the design and operation of a mechanism.
<P>
It is, accordingly, not amiss to pause and consider the fundamentals
of the design in any mechanism. Suppose
for example that one is designing a vacuum tube amplifier. The first
question that is asked is what is it expected to do when it is
finished? Over what range of
frequencies is it to amplify, how many decibels gain is
it to have, and what is to be its noise level? A next
question follows, and that is, what are the elements of
design that will satisfy the above performance specifications? And
last, what are the available materials?
<P>
With these questions asked and answered, the designer is now ready to
proceed with the individual details, each of which must satisfy the
rigid conditions that
(1) the material to be used must be available, and (2)
the final performance specifications must be satisfied.
<P>
In an exactly similar manner one may approach the social mechanism and
ask what it is we wish it to do.
What shall we specify as the operating characteristics
we wish to be met? Only a few will suffice as examples.
Suppose we drop all the moralistic cant about social
justice and specify instead that we wish the social mechanism to so
perform as to maintain the highest standard
of public health obtainable in the light of modern medical
science. Suppose we specify further that we want the
social mechanism to produce the highest per capita physical standard
of living at the least unnecessary expenditure of human labor, and
with a minimum wastage (or
highest efficiency of conversion) of non-replaceable
natural resources.
<P>
<H3>Determining the ``Musts''</H3>
<P>
From such performance specifications as these, and with an inventory
of available resources, equipment, and
manpower, the designer then proceeds to determine what
the details of the design <em>must</em> be if the specified
performance is to be obtained.
<P>
If, for instance, the highest possible standard of public health is to
be obtained, adequate medical and hospital
facilities must be available to every member of the population. Since
public health is a function of nutrition, of
the hours and conditions of work, and of one's habitation
and facilities for leisure and recreation, it follows that
in order for the standard of public health to attain a
maximum, the food of every member of the population
must be the best, the living conditions must be sanitary,
the hours of labor must be short enough, and the conditions of work
such that physiological injury will not
result. Furthermore, adequate recreation facilities for
the whole population must be available.
<P>
If the highest physical standard of living is to be obtained with the
least unnecessary expenditure of human 
effort and a minimum wastage of non-replaceable natural
resources, it follows that industrial production must be
set and maintained at an arbitrary high level, that the
most automatic processes must be used, and that all
processes must operate at the highest thermodynamic
efficiency obtainable. It also follows that the products
of such industrial activity must be distributed to each
member of the society individually, irrespective of
whether he happens to work or not.
<P>
Further requirements following from these performance specifications
are that the tempo and magnitude
of our industrial operations must be increased, not decreased, and
that such increase carry with it the necessity of synchronization and
coordination of all the parts
of the social mechanism if the whole is to be maintained
in a state of smooth and orderly operation, rather than
one characterized by violent oscillations. It follows,
therefore, that the entire social mechanism must be
manned not by numerous petty rival organizations each
striving to survive at the expense of the rest, but rather
by a single coordinated organization built along the lines
of the functions that must be performed.
<P>
<H3>More, Rather than Less</H3>
<P>
It also follows--since human labor is, under such circumstances, a
<em>diminishing</em> quantity in the presence of, an
<em>increasing</em> production, and since continued smooth operation can only
be maintained provided the products
are distributed for consumption at the rate they are
produced--that a mechanism of distribution in no way
dependent upon human hours of labor must be instituted.
More production, rather than less, plenty rather than
scarcity, must be the fundamental theme.
<P>
Since a high-energy social mechanism necessarily involves a
specification of function, and since the requirements in each
particular function are of necessity known
to at most only a small fraction of the total population,
it follows that all theories of democracy are inadequate
and obsolete for the control and operation of such a
mechanism. It is a significant fact that no ship or
power house is ever operated by democratic procedure.
<P>
Since, likewise, all money in whatever form is a common denominator of
<em>value</em>, and since value requires
scarcity (all values go to pieces in the presence of plenty
hence the hog-killing and crop-reducing programs of
the Government) it follows that all systems of money
as a mechanism of distribution break down completely
or become useless in the presence of abundance. Hence,
if abundance is to be the end-product of our social operation as
specified in our design criterion, it follows that
a non-monetary mechanism of distribution must be provided which will
distribute the goods and services at a
rate essentially equal to the rate of production, and quite
independently of any value criteria of the services rendered by each
individual.
<P>
But, with a non-political, non-democratic social structure such as is
required if the social mechanism is even
to approach the operating standards we have specified,
and with a non-monetary mechanism of distribution, not
only would the Federal Government, along with the
thousands of state, county, and local political governments, no longer
exist, but neither would those purely
pecuniary activities (as distinguished from industrial
activities) known as business, banking, insurance, trade,
and commerce, together with the principal services of
the legal profession, be found necessary.
<P>
Not even the wildest of the Constitution quoters would dare suggest,
however, that it is in accordance with the
spirit of the Constitution to abolish political government
and democratic procedure <em>in toto</em>, and to dispense with
that denominator of all scarcity--money. One
is, therefore, obliged to conclude that it is contrary to
the spirit of the Constitution of the United States (and,
incidentally, the same is true of the code of ethics of the
American Medical Association) for there to be maintained a high
standard of public health. It is unconstitutional to do those things
necessary to conserve our non-replaceable national resources; it is
unconstitutional
to give every man a job, an adequate house, and sufficient
food and clothing; it is unconstitutional to give every
child an opportunity for a higher educational training
accordance with his inherent ability; in short, it is
contrary to the spirit of the Constitution of the United
States to do any of those things necessary to operate a
social mechanism involving over one billion horsepower
of prime movers in such a manner as to result in even
a modicum of economic security to the citizens thereof.
<P>
And still the game of Constitution Quoting goes on.
