<p>
This story was told by Mr. Robert Hemphill, former credit
manager of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, Georgia, when he
was called to testify at Congressional hearings on the cause of
depressions in America.  Who should know better?
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>
Once upon a time, to the Temple of the Thirteen Suns came the
rich and powerful chief Oomah the Third, who said to the
goldsmith of the temple, Hansen L. Roschab . . . ``I have much
gold and am about to depart for a far country.  Wilt keep this
gold safely for me against my return a year hence? I will pay
thee well.''
<p>
The wily Hansen coughed loudly and covered his countenance with
a cloth lest the rich Oomah the Third observe his joy to have
this treasure in his possession.  When he was calm and could
look serious he said to Oomah . . . ``It is a very great
responsibility and risk, but I will undertake it for a tithe
that will be one shekel in every ten.''
<p>
Then said Oomah . . . ``It is a deal.''  And forthwith his slaves
delivered many bags containing in all a thousand shekels of gold
for which Hansen L. Roschab, the goldsmith, gave the chief a
parchment receipt acknowledging this deposit, which contained
the writing, ``payable to whomsoever.''  Thereupon the chief
departed happily on his journey.
<p>
As soon as he was well out of the country, the shrewd Hansen
called his confidential scribe and bade him thus . . . ``Go thee
now to the merchants whom I will tell thee of and secretly say
to each that thy master hath a little gold for hire upon good
security.''  And the servant departed swiftly.
<p>
Soon there came to him a great merchant who said . . . ``Hansen,
you old crook, I am in a jam for a few shekels of gold.  Wilt
lend me?''  And Hansen replied . . . ``Money is very tight these
days, but it might be so arranged.  What is thy need?''  The
merchant answered . . . ``Two hundred shekels.''
<p>
Then said Hansen . . . ``It is much money.  What security couldst
thou pledge for so great a sum?''
<p>
Then the merchant showed Hansen a writing of his possessions of
merchandise to the amount of a thousand shekels.  Hansen said .
. . ``It is not enough.  Thou must also pledge thy dwelling and
thy slaves and thy raiment.''  Whereupon the merchant, after much
protest, pledged all his possessions, even to his innermost
raiment.  (So Hansen loaned him the money.)
<p>
Then said he to Hansen . . . ``I have no place to store so much
gold.  Keep it safe for me and give me a writing that I may
deliver to whomsoever I will.''  And Hansen did even so.
<p>
The next day came another merchant, and another, and still
another, and to each Hansen loaned a portion of the gold of
chief Oomah the Third, taking from each as security his entire
possessions, including his innermost personal raiment, and gave
to each a writing upon a parchment showing that each had on
deposit the gold he had borrowed.  And it came to pass that on
the tenth day he had given parchment deposit writings for the
whole of the thousand shekels; but he sill had all the gold.
<p>
Hansen reflected much upon this curious state of affairs, and
said to himself . . . ``These birds know not how much gold I
possess.  They do not want the actual gold itself.  What they
rally want is credit, some deposit writing that they may pass
from hand to hand as money.  I have one grand idea!''
<p>
On the next day came another merchant, and another, and still
another, and to each Hansen showed the great store of gold of
Oomah the Third, and to each he pretended to loan a portion,
although he had previously loaned it all to the first ones who
came.
<p>
And it came to pass that at the end of another ten days Hansen
had pretended to loan to many more merchants and had given
writings of deposit for a second thousand shekels, making 2000
shekels in all, although he had only 1000 shekels of Oomah the
Third.  And still he had all the gold.
<p>
Whereupon Hansen reflected to himself . . . ``What a leaden-pipe
cinch.  I wonder I did not think of this before.  I can collect
just as much usury from the phony deposit writings as for the
genuine.  Verily, I am a financial wizard.''
<p>
Thereupon Hansen caused it to be noised about that he possessed
a vast store of gold for hire, and many more merchants came to
borrow, and to each Hansen delivered writings of deposit and
collected generous usury and demanded pledges of all his
possessions even unto his innermost raiment, until he had issued
writings of deposit for 10,000 shekels and held mortgages on
substantially the whole city.
<p>
Then went Hansen to the wise man of the city and said unto him .
. . ``Verily I have discovered the greatest racket of all time.
I have learned the magic of making gold out of baloney; and if I
can keep the formula secret for a few years I will collect a
fortune that will make Solomon's treasury look like a second
hand store.  Tell me how I may keep secret this bonanza of mine
for mine own profit.''
<p>
Then said the wise man . . . ``Look wise and say little and only
upon matters afar off.  Obtain the ear of the town crier.
Engage him to spread the impression that money is a mysterious
subject that no one understands but thee alone.  Be friendly with
the king's councillors and grant their favors that the king may
smile upon thee.''
<p>
And Hansen did as he was bid and collected much usury from his
phony loan deposits that circulated as money.  He built for
himself a mansion, collected works of art, and clothed his wives
and concubines with fine linen and jewels.
<p>
When his business had grown to many times its humble beginnings,
he took over the entire temple and by way of a sly joke called
it the First National Bank, the same being from an obscure
language and meaning ``place of imaginary money.''
<p>
And that is the reason that all banks today have great marble
pillars and bronze doors, so that they may resemble outwardly as
well as internally the ``place of imaginary money'' that Hansen L.
Roschab builded upon the gold of Oomah the Third in the Temple
of the Thirteen Suns.
