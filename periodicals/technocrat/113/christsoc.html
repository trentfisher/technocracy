Despite the title, this is not an
article on religion. Nor is it an
attack on any religious belief or
creed. Rather, it is an attempt to show
how, illogical it is to attempt to establish
what we are pleased to call `A
Christian Society' in an economy where
the rule is not the `Golden Rule,' but
`Every fellow for himself and the devil
take the hindmost.' For that is the type
of society in which we live today. Of
course, some will deny the accuracy
of that statement and claim that all
we need is some moral reconversion
and all will be well.  Well, we are not
going to argue about it, but anyone
who will take the trouble to examine
the nature of our social economy will
see that it is impossible to practice
what we call `Christian principles' when
it is becoming harder every day to
chisel a bare existence.
<p>
One of the outstanding exponents
of Christian social reconstruction is the
Archbishop of Canterbury, who once
horrified the British Chancellor of the
Exchequer by suggesting that a budget
surplus should be given to the unemployed rather than used to reduce
taxes. At one time Archbishop Temple set forth six propositions for a
Christian society. Technocracy has no
quarrel with any of them; in fact, we
are heartily in accord with them, and
are using every effort to assure their
realization for all Americans. However, these lofty ideals will never be
realized as long as we cling to the
obsolete social order which is America's Price System. They can, on the
other hand, quickly become an integral
part of the lives of all Americans once
we install the scientific social design
of the American Technate--the design
which Technocracy indicates as the
next most probable state of society
on the North American Continent.
<p>
Let us consider the propositions
offered by the Archbishop and analyze
them in the light of the improbability
of their realization under our present
social structure. The first one states:
<p>
<blockquote>
<strong>
Every child should find itself a
member of a family housed with
decency and dignify.
</strong>
</blockquote>
<p>
In the light of existing housing conditions throughout America, this
proposition sounds almost ludicrous. With
millions of our children housed in
crowded tenements in slum areas, in
trailers, shacks, abandoned chicken
coops, army barracks and many other
makeshifts that offer nothing more
than bare shelter, to talk of decency
and dignity is to make a mockery of
those terms. President Truman has
recently outlined a housing program
covering a two-year period, during
which 2,700,000 new homes for veterans are to be built. Anyone who has
been having trouble getting a little
lumber for needed repairs might wonder where the materials are coming
from for such an ambitious program,
but anyway it is a good idea. A system of subsidies will guarantee the
necessary profit which, of course, is
the required incentive for private
enterprise to go ahead. It seems extremely doubtful that Congress will
permit any price ceilings on old buildings so everybody in the real estate
business ought to be very happy over
the whole thing.  Our veterans will be
permitted to go into debt in order to
finance these new homes and that will
be good for the banking fraternity.
<p>
Now let us take a look at the figures
submitted by Wilson Wyatt, housing
administrator. Married veterans who
will need homes by December, says
Mr. Wyatt, total 2,900,000. Others
who will marry and need homes by the
end of this year number 560,000, making a total of 3,460,000. Deduct from
this total 945,000 vacancies caused by
dissolution of families and the net
additional homes needed by the end
of 1946 is 2,515,000. The total needed
by the end of 1947 will be 3,195,000.
In other words. the President's program will just about offset the demand
of new families being established.  Not
a word is said about those millions of
Americans now living in sub-standard
homes. Are these to be forgotten?
Is our Christian society going to condemn these millions to a lifetime of
squalor and poverty? What about this
'decency and dignity' Archbishop
Temple mentions?
<p>
Apparently the Archbishop concedes, by implication, the lack of a
Christian society at the present time
because certainly no one could say the
unfortunate children of families living
under such conditions are housed with
`decency and dignity.' That happy
condition must await the arrival of a
new social design in America, when
price and profit no longer decide
whether we live in `decency and dignity' or in poverty and
squalor. America as the resources and the engineering capacity to
house adequately
every American family in `decency and
dignity.' How long are the wives and
mothers of this nation going to endure
conditions which compel even one
family to live in any other way?
<p>
<blockquote><strong>
Every child should have an opportunity or education up to maturity.
</strong></blockquote>
<p>
Here. again, our present society fails
to measure up to specifications. True,
we have far greater opportunities for
education than we ever had before but
we still fall far short of this suggested
requirement for a Christian society.
As we have pointed out on previous
occasions, education today is limited,
like everything else, by the purchasing
power available, either of the community or of the individual. It cannot,
by the very nature of Price System
methods operation, be free to every
citizen. Building materials for schools
cost money; teachers must be paid
salaries; books must be purchased; and
all of these items must be provided
for out of the public purse. Students
desiring to go on to college and university must provide their own
financing or the parents must foot the bills.
Too frequently it happens that a boy
or girl must leave school and go to
work in order to aid the family financially. In short, we do not yet have the
kind of society in which we can guarantee our children opportunity for
education up to maturity. Here, again,
we fail in Archbishop Temple's conception of a Christian society.
<p>
Yet there is no reason why we should
continue to fail because the `makings'
of that type of society are at our
disposal right now. We have only to
conform to the demands of a technological society and install a social
design compatible with our present
scientific and technological development. Sooner or later we will have to
install that design in order to avert
social chaos, so why the delay?
<p>
In the social design of Technocracy
you will find the specifications for the
complete education of every citizen
up to maturity. The first 25 years will
be devoted to education and training
for some functional capacity in one of
the industrial or service sequences.
The energy cost of operating this educational sequence would be part of
the Continental overhead and would
cost the individual nothing. It would
be rendered as a national service just
as the fire and police protection one
would receive, or the public health
service--not because of any Christian
principles but because illiterates cannot operate successfully the highly
complex structure of modern civilization in America. And so we would
see once again the realization of what
we call Christian principles, not because of any religious beliefs or
ideologies, but because that happens to be 
the only way modern civilization in
America can be operated successfully.
<p>
<blockquote><strong>
Every citizen should have sufficient
income to make a home and bring
up his children properly.
</strong></blockquote>
<p>
We could write a series of articles
enlarging on this theme. For the present, however, we must content
ourselves with pointing out that mass
chasing power in America steadily
declines as our technological installations increase. That is just
another way
of saying that the more machines we
use, the fewer men are necessary to
produce the things we need. Wages
and salaries are paid for man-hours
of human labor and the trend in America is toward fewer man-hours in
industry. Only a comparatively small percentage of the population
receives sufficient purchasing power, to `make a
home and bring up their children properly.'
<p>
And how much can we purchase
with our steadily declining income?
With every passing month we find our
purchasing power dwindling. Wages
may remain the same or even increase
but is how much we can buy with
our money that determines our standard of living. And the cost of living
is steadily rising. Food, clothing and
shelter all are going up. It is not so
bad when wages can be raised accordingly but this only means added
costs of production and increased
prices.  The costs of production can be
lowered by the installation of more
automatic machinery but this, in turn,
means increased unemployment.
<p>
There is another large group in our
national economy that suffers increasingly from the rising cost of living.
This group is made up of those living
on pensions, salaries fixed by law, investments and so on. Pensions, at best
mere pittances, have not been increased; salaries fixed by law usually
need constitutional amendments to
change and, while some have been
adjusted, the increases have not been
sufficient to make much difference.
Incomes from investments have, for the
most part, declined due to lowering
interest rates and high corporate
taxes. Many of the stockholders of
large corporations are `little people'
who own, on the average, only a few
shares each. High taxes and increased
wages have been used as an excuse
to reduce dividends in many cases,
causing considerable hardship among
small stockholders. In short, the late
President Roosevelt's statement that
one-third of our nation is ill-housed,
ill-fed and ill-clothed still holds good,
and if Archbishop Temple's Christian
society is to be realized it will have to
be outside the limitations of America's
Price System.
<p>
In a functional society, possessed of
natural resources and automatic machinery such as we have in America,
the abundance of physical wealth resulting from mass production methods
of operation can be so great that a
differentiation of income actually becomes a handicap. Under such
conditions the best way of distributing
income is equally to every citizen within the operating area that society.
When this is done every man, woman
and child in America will have more
than it is convenient to use. At last
the Archbishop's third specification for
a Christian society will be realized:
every citizen will have sufficient income
to make a home and bring up his children properly. Poverty will no longer
exist in America.
<p>
<blockquote><strong>
Every citizen should be guaranteed
freedom of worship, speech, assembly
and association.
</strong></blockquote>
<p>
This is the only one of the Archbishop
suggestions that we even approach
in our present society. Yet
freedom of speech is rather an empty
phrase when, in many instances, a
rigidly controlled press prevents what
we might have to say from being
heard. Let us realize that here, again,
we see the interference controls of the
Price System in active operation. An
outstanding example of how this control is exercised is shown in the subject
of Technocracy itself. How often do
you read, in your large metropolitan
papers, of any activity of this Organization? Even a mass public meeting
in Hollywood Bowl does not rate more
than a line or two, if that much. The
reason, of course, is that Technocracy
is not a pleasant subject in the exclusive circles of business and finance
and it just isn't mentioned. The newspapers, of course, play ball with these
groups because it is from those sources
that they derive most of their revenue
and they can't afford to antagonize
them.
<p>
And in most of our colleges and
universities can a professor discuss or
present, in any way, the subject of
Technocracy?  With few exceptions,
he cannot. If he did, he would quickly
find himself out in the cold, cruel world,
without a job. The, college authorities
cannot afford to offend the banking
interests, who, perhaps, have loaned
them money and hold notes or mortgages.
They, too, must play ball.
<p>
We use the example of Technocracy
only to illustrate our point. The press
in a Price System must look out for
its own interests and the kind of news
or editorial policy which best serves
that interest is the kind of news we
get. Quite frequently it is distorted
and colored to serve the interests of
a pressure group. That group may be
a political party, a labor union, a religious denomination, an industry or
business, or any of a hundred or more
individual or group interests. Very seldom does a newspaper take up a fight
in the best interests of all Americans.
It cannot afford to do so.
<p>
An excellent instance is being shown
to us today in the increasing propaganda designed to create distrust and
hatred for Soviet Russia. Well, now
that World War II is over, we are in
a mess from an economic standpoint.
Another war will provide markets for
our heavy industries and the problem
will be solved. As Technocracy has
frequently pointed out, the Price System, at the point to which it has now
arrived, can survive only through the
medium of vast government spending
and what better means of forcing that
spending than another war? And that
`nasty' word `communism' makes Soviet Russia a natural for the artists of
propaganda and lies.
<p>
But in the American Technate, when
our newspapers will probably be operated by the communications sequence,
with no interests to be served other
that those of the American people
themselves, we will see a very different
picture. Facts can then be presented
without the ever-present danger, in a
Price System, of stepping on someone's toes. There will be only be
editorial policy: the presentation of factual information.
<p>
Archbishop Temple's fifth suggestion for what he considers a Christian
society is one toward which labor unions made considerable progress in
the past few years. This suggestion is
that:
<p>
<blockquote><strong>
Every worker should have a voice in
the conduct of the business or industry in which he works.
</strong></blockquote>
<p>
But here again let us note the wide
difference in `having a voice in business and industry' today and having
a voice in the operation of your own
industrial or service sequence in a
Technate. In asking for a voice in industry today are we in any way
concerned with anything beyond what we
ourselves make in a financial way out
of that industry or business? Are we
concerned with the quality of the
product or the effectiveness of the
service?
<p>
In a Price System, we must remember always that quick turnover of
merchandise is necessary in order to assure a good return on the
original investment. But in the social operation
of a Technate the reverse is true. Here
it is to the best interests of the worker.
who, incidentally, would be personally
responsible for doing everything possible to assure the greatest degree of
efficiency in his particular operation,
to turn out the best product science
and engineering skill can devise. The
less turnover of merchandise, the less
human labor would be necessary, but
without loss of purchasing power as is
the case now when human labor is not
needed.
<p>
And so once again we see the conflict between our present social system
and what we call Christianity.  In many
cases today, the worker <strong>does</strong> have a
voice in management, but it is a very
weak and ineffective voice and can
never have any effect in providing the
best product or service which it is possible to produce.
In the scientific operation of the Technate, however, he
will be expected to do everything in
his power to raise the standards of
production in the sequence in which
he works.
<p>
The sixth and last of Archbishop
Temple's suggestions which we will analyze can be quickly disposed of. It
is right in line with possibilities seen
by almost every scientist and engineer.
<p>
<blockquote><strong>
Every citizen should have sufficient
leisure-two days' rest in seven and
an annual holiday with pay.
</strong></blockquote>
<p>
Why stop at two days' rest? Engineers will tell you that it is possible,
with our present automatic machinery,
to cut necessary human labor to about
four hours a day and four days a week
for most workers. But what would
happen in a Price System if we attempted anything like that? If we
increased wages to twice what they
are now we would still average only
about $35 a week each. In other words,
most of us would still have a very low
standard of living.  Private enterprise
could not possibly divide the work
among the entire working population;
pay enough for a high standard of
living and still come out on top with
a profit. And yet we know that 16
hours a week is all the human labor
necessary to operate our various industries and services. Obviously in
order to take advantage of that possibility we must install a `new kind of
social system differing from any existing today' The design of that system
is what we call Technocracy--a Government of Function-- in which politics,
finance and business have no part, and
in which all our industries and services
will be streamlined into functional
sequences for the purpose of producing the physical goods we use and for
providing all necessary utilities and
services. The distributive system will
be designed in such a way that every
citizen will receive an abundance of
goods and services without price or
profit. Few of us will need to work
more than four hours a day, four days a week for 165 days a year.
Would that leave you sufficient rest and vacation for you?
<p>
So here, if you agree with Archbishop Temple's ideas, is your
Christian society.  After 2000 year of talking about it, we can now
achieve it.  Install the functional design of Technocracy and your
Christian society comes into existence automatically... You won't get
it by merely wishing of hoping for it, or by any program aimed at
moral reconversion.  You can get it only by first understanding the
conditions which make it necessary to our continued existence; then by
joining the Organization which has the
blueprint for that kind of society and
working diligently to achieve it.
