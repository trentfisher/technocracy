All nations have engaged in war as a national policy. Isn't it high
time that we approached the problem of war in a correct manner--that we
change the system and not the individuals?
</blockquote>
<p>
In 1931, When Japan invaded Manchuria, the Japanese were incapable of
waging a global war. Yet American, French and British business
continued to deal with the Japanese until 1941, selling them scrap
steel and petroleum in quantities far in excess of their normal
peacetime requirements, knowing full well that such dealings might
result in war.
<p>
In 1934, Germany, under the Nazis, announced to all the world that its
program was a return to conditions preceding the Versailles Treaty,
Anschluss with Austria, and a crusade against Bolshevism. Yet
American, French and British business continued to deal with the
Germans, selling them airplane engines, planes and petroleum, far in
excess of their normal peacetime requirements, knowing equally well
that such dealings might result in war.
<p>
In a Price System world, private enterprise prosperity is promoted by
the shipment of goods from a producer nation to a consumer nation --
even though the producer nation may be depleting its vanishing
resources to the point where it will shortly have to join the ranks of
the `have-nots.' History is replete with such `have-nots' -- Phoenicia,
Mesopotamia, Greece, Carthage, Italy, Great Britain. Because Britain
hasn't what it takes at home any more (lacking timber, iron and
petroleum, and importing 50% of her food) and because she has been a
`have-not' for over 350 years, she will always of necessity fight to
retain her sea lanes through the Gibraltar, the Mediterranean and the
Suez Canal as her life line.
<p>
In a Price System world, we find a community of interest even between
potential enemies, as the last 20 years have demonstrated, brought
about through the synthetic prosperity which is fostered in the
internal affairs of the shipper and by the bounteous shipment of
scarce goods to the economy of the receiving nation. Both find it
desirable to promote the trade and commerce of goods--even war goods.
<p>
Whenever any nation sends war goods to another nation during a period
of non-hostilities, it is doing so at its peril because it may be
sending war goods to a potential enemy. It may be good business for
the individual corporation or private enterprise in the sender
nation--but it is death-dealing business to the sons and the fathers of
that nation. We had a taste of just this sort of murderous practice
when we were placed on the receiving end of German and Japanese
death-dealing machines that originated on this Continent.
<p>
The fact remains that in a Price System, the manufacture and sale of
war goods and implements is profitable business. In fact, it is good
business even to sell to the enemy while you are at war with him as
both World Wars I and II have shown conclusively.
<p>
<h3>A COMMERCIAL WAR</h3>
<p>
We saw the results of foreign trade pressure in World War I. Woodrow
Wilson, the President of the United States, and Walter Hines Page, our
Ambassador to Britain in 1917, have both testified to the fact that
World War I was a commercial war--the military expression of the prewar
international rivalry for foreign trade and colonies which had been
going on for decades. Our private bankers were gradually being driven
bankrupt because they were backing the losing side in World War I.
Hines' letters and cables bear this out. If we had not entered the
war when we did, and if Germany had won that war, we would have
suffered a disastrous financial panic in this country. 
<p>
Our shipments of war material to Germany and Japan in the decade
before 1941 are the result of the same pressures as were at work in
World War I. What factors in the world picture are present today which
will better protect us from the inevitable result of business
pressures again driving us to equip Germany and Japan with war goods?
Or instead of Germany and Japan, what difference would it make to our
national welfare if we chose to favor China and France this time? 
<p>
Americans are no more evil or murderous than any other set of human
beings anywhere else in the world--and for that matter, no less. But
as businessmen in a Price System, our citizens needed foreign trade in
the 1920's, the 1930's and they shall need it again in 1946, if we
ever expect to achieve a prosperity in this country within the
framework of a continuing Price System.
<p>
We keep hopping up our national morale with promise of a $150 billion
national income, yet the plain fact is that we never had a national
income higher than $80 billion in all our prewar history. Isn't it
significant that the only way in which we achieved the $150 billion
annual incomes in 1943, 1944 and 1945 was by virtue of the fact that
we were shipping abroad and expending for military purposes at the
unprecedented rate of $75 to $100 billion annually? Where and how can
we expect to find the replacement for these $75 to $100 billion war
expenditures to bring our national income up to equal these
wishful-thinking promises when we consider that the entire world trade
before 1939--all world trade, mind you--was only $25 billion?
<p>
Oh, yes, we hear talk of the additional income that we will earn from
the production of autos, the construction of houses and roads, of
which we have been deprived during the war years. But after we have
provided for these outstanding non-recurring needs, what others are
there that could possibly amount to sufficient business volume to
result in any considerable sum of additional national income?
<p>
Take a look at the peace picture today.
<p>
We stopped fighting against the Japanese in August, 1945. Now, only
six months later, the Japs are fighting alongside British and Chinese
troops in China and Indonesia. We thought we went to Asia to disarm
the Japanese.
<p>
We stopped fighting against the Germans on May 8, 1945. Now, less than
a year later, there are still hundreds of thousands of German
prisoners organized as an armed force with their own officer
cadres. How can anyone but a protocol-minded diplomat tell an enemy
from an ally at even ten paces, when your enemy in one war is your
ally in the next war. or even in the same war?
<p>
The politically-organized, scarcity economy, Price System world is a
WAR world because it can't be anything else. Read the papers. ``We must
talk stiffly to -------''; ``We must meet aggression with force''; ``We have no
reason for war.'' These are the headlines in recent weeks. Methinks
that the lady doth protest too much. Chastity does not need words to
receive its merited acceptance. Neither does any nation need to go
about protesting its peaceful intentions. ``We shall have peace--even
if we have to go to war for it! We will use force--to bar aggression.''
<strong>The Price System is war and always has been.</strong>
<p>
The psychologists have a word for it. They call it `guilt complex.'
Beware of those who belabor us with words of their own innocence. What
happened at the UNO Conference recently ended in London? The Big Three
were at each other's throats continuously--there, as everywhere
else. How can we expect a unification of 60 or more nations, with
diverse resources and populations, when each of those nations to be
united into a world federation is itself rent and torn by internal
strife because of the imbalance between its own resources and
population?
<p>
But the apologists for a continuance of the status quo--those who have
vested interests to protect--organized, business, organized politics
and organized religion--will tell us that it is a healthy thing for
nations to air their grievances in international conferences.
<p>
Then they come home and shout defiantly that `nobody can live with
those Russians And the Russians, too, go home and shout defiantly that
`no one can live with those capitalists!' The answer is very
obvious--no one can live in a world where there is not enough to eat!
<p>
If all this posturing doesn't have the earmarks of setting up a moral
basis for another war, a crusade or any other name you choose to call
it--so long as our people can be induced to swallow it--then a skunk
smells like a rose!
<p>
``We are going to fight those Bolshies because they are bad, evil,
atheistic men and they don't respect property.''  Who says so?
<p>
``We shall see to it that the small nations get justice in this world.''
Whose justice? Ours?
<p>
``They'll have democracy, too.''  Whose democracy?
<p>
``They shall have everything-to our way of liking.''  Or else!
<p>
Given low resources and high population as exist today in all of
Europe and Asia (except Russia) which takes in more than two-thirds of
the world's people, the result must be pressures, both internal and
external, for relief from the intolerable physical conditions. In a
world of national separations, which are totally unrelated to their
geographic contours, each nation will inevitably strive to establish a
strategic frontier for itself.
<p>
<h3>A PEACEFUL WORLD?</h3>
<p>
The history of the last 3500 years bears out the fact that we have
never been able to talk ourselves into a peace, for over 3100 of these
3500 years have witnessed war somewhere in the world. The normal
course of events in a Price System is not peace but war, and we
shall not be able to
`talk' our way out of it. Peace will never be achieved by evangelism
and moral crusading. We have seen tribes nations, states, dynasties
and empires rise and fall, through military success or military
defeat. Those which are today known as the peace-loving nations are
merely the ones that have no need for further conquests--like
ourselves--or are the ones that suffered such a thorough defeat in
centuries past that they haven't the energy or the resources to
conduct a successful military venture--like China.
<p>
Yet every nation--ourselves and China included--is engaged in a mad race
to retain and build up its armaments to the fullest extent of its
resources and financial capacity. For what? For peace?
<p>
History has proved that every nation on the face of the earth has at
some time or other been warlike, and at other times pacific. No people
ever acquired nationhood except by military power. The Chinese have
been warlike. The British have been warlike. The French have been
warlike. What is it that makes people go to war? Perverse human nature?
Is it just certain human natures, like the Germans and the Japanese,
or does it have anything to do with human nature at all?
<p>
Throw ten hungry, starving cats into a confined pit. You won't have
ten cats for very long. Throw ten, starving hungry men into a confined
pit. You won't have ten men for very long. Many of us still remember
the Nobile expedition to the North Pole. Five men went out but only
four came back. In many parts of China cannibalism is still
practiced. Many tribes in South America still practice cannibalism.
<p>
Ah, but we say, man is civilized. Well, what distinguishes man from
the animal? Is he more humane? Sure he's humane--but he's just as
deadly and murderous when he gets hungry enough. Is he born civilized?
is an infant civilized by virtue of being born of civilized man?
<p>
If men are not born civilized, and the anthropologists and the
sociologists are the experts in this field, then apparently the
environment into which man is born must itself be the basic
causation.
<p>
You may remember the exhibition of a marine tank some years ago in
Florida. This tank contained every variety of fish-life, including
some species which ate other fish and some which were man-eating as
well. Yet, every day a human being went down into that tank completely
unprotected in order to clean out the bottom. There he was in the
midst of man-eating sharks and other such ferocious specimens, but
never was he molested. The answer is simple. The fish in that tank
were fed enough and fed regularly.
<p>
<h3>BASIC CAUSE OF WAR</h3>
<p>
Now if you throw 140 million people into a scarcity area where they
cannot get enough to feed themselves regularly, they must either war
among themselves or with another area for the acquisition of the
minimum necessities for maintaining life.
<p>
The world agricultural resources today total only four billion
acres. We need two and one-half acres to provide each person with the
minimum food necessities for maintaining life. That leaves over 600
million people who cannot be provided with any food at all, or leaves
the total population with so little food as to result in less than a
minimum level for all. And this takes no account of the fact that
India and China alone will increase their populations about 50 million
each in the next ten years.
<p>
Look around the world map Kuomintang Chinese are fighting Communist
Chinese. Why? Would Chinese fight Chinese if they were all well fed
and warm? Sure, the explanations and the reasons given by the
moralists and apologists have the usual philosophic ring about good
and evil men, just and unjust, democratic and communistic. But reasons
and explanations such as these are only rationalizations for the
basic, fundamental cause--food for a Scarcity-ridden China.
<p>
Americans and Japanese are helping the Kuomintang Chinese in their
fight. Why do Americans and Japanese-recently violent, vitriolic
enemies-join hands to help one group of Chinese against another group
of Chinese? A Yenan Chinaman in Kuamintang wouldn't look any different
than a native. But Manchuria, Shantung and Mongolia, controlled by the
Tenon Chinese, become very important to both Japanese and
Americans. China, under Kuomintang control, is potentially lucrative
to our private enterprisers in foreign trade. Our politicians and
businessmen, completely incapacitated in the face of abundance at
home, desperately need a formula for destroying that abundance. `Sink
it, burn it, ship it off the Continent--but get rid of it!' is their
motto. So private enterprise goes in for a campaign of propaganda to
get the American people to accept the necessity of foreign trade--just
as we were propagandized into an acceptance of war.
<p>
The Yugoslavs and the British are maneuvering in the Trieste
area. Why? Because Trieste is a strategic harbor on the Adriatic and
one of the gateways to the Danubian Basin. The Adriatic and the
Mediterranean lie astride the British life line. It doesn't matter to
the British who will control Trieste so long as the nation that does
control it is friendly to the British. With the Karageorgevich dynasty
back in control of Yugoslavia, would the British behave the same way?
The bald fact is that Yugoslavia under Soviet influence is a threat to
British security, in a scarcity world.
<p>
The British are still occupying their former ally Greece. What does
democracy or religion or future intentions toward world unity have to
do with continued British occupation? Only after a friendly regime has
been firmly established--one that will not denounce the high interest
rate on the Royal Government loans, chiefly held by British investors,
and one which will be no threat to their life line to India--will the
British consent to withdraw from Greece.
<p>
There is rebellion and bloodshed in India, Egypt and Palestine all
British mandated or controlled territory.
<p>
There is a struggle going on in Iran among Russia, Britain and
America. Russia is demanding the return of strategic Ars and Kardahan
from Turkey and wants unrestricted access to the Mediterranean.
<p>
And here at home we are witnessing a titanic labor struggle involving
millions of men--with CIO battling AFL bitterly and both of them
engaged in a knock-down, drag-out, three-cornered fight with
industry.
<p>
All this has been going on without a single peace treaty written yet,
no less signed. <strong>What war is over in what world?</strong>
<p>
<strong>The Price System breeds war!</strong>
It has nothing to do with the individual
men who live in that system. We have today, and have had, price
systems in backward and progressive nations, in Christian and heathen
nations, in brown, black and white nations, in every kind of nation
during every century. Yet, all nations have engaged in war as a
national policy. Isn't it high time that we approached the problem of
war in a correct manner, changing the system and not the individuals?
<p>
<h3>DEFINING TERMS</h3>
<p>
When Technocrats use the words Price System they mean any social
system that effects its distribution of goods and services by means of
trade or commerce based on commodity valuation and employing a form of
debt token or money. Only scarcities can be distributed by trade or
commerce. Therefore, any area which operates under a Price System can
be referred to as a scarcity economy area. Price System and scarcity,
you see, are synonymous.
<p>
When we use the term `war,' we mean organized physical conflict
between human beings whether the weapons employed be primitive bows
and arrows, sling shots and ramming rods or modern gunpowder,
artillery and atomic bombs.
<p>
Do wars break out because of individual pugnacity, individual urge for
self-preservation or because man was born in original sin and
therefore an evil-doer? Man's instincts cannot exist in a vacuum. They
must have dimension and a live environment in which to express
themselves. It is the environment which provides the vessel in which
is brewed the mass drive toward war. The manner in which patriotism,
love of power, love of glory, dislike of what is alien and the feeling
of superiority are expressed, are but the mores and the teachings of a
society in which a mass of people live, and they have nothing to do
with the instincts of the individual. For instance, once we got into
World War II, we taught our youth that organized homicide of the enemy
was patriotic, and we spent millions of dollars in an organized
campaign of appeals and propaganda showing the desirability of killing
for our national salvation.
<p>
December 6, 1941, we were pacifist.
<p>
December 8, 1941, we were militarist.
<p>
Did a miracle occur by a change in our instincts? We were merely doing
what we had to do in order to survive.
<p>
Can we ever prevent future wars by war guilt trials, treaties between
resource-hungry, over-populated nations, or by federation of a world
of scarcity? Suppose we indict, try and convict a million so-called
war guilty. Will that do away with the fact that the same environment,
of scarcity of resources in the midst of overexpanded population,
which produced war guilty hundreds of times in the last 3500 years,
will inevitably produce a fresh crop of war guilty?
<p>
We have had prisons and hangings for thousands of years. We have had
police forces and laws against stealing and killing. Have these served
to eliminate or even reduce crime? It still remains a simple thing to
predict that economic depressions increase the incidence of crime and
economic prosperity reduces the incidence of crime.
<p>
In a Price System scarcity world, any nation which does not strive to
better itself by capturing or acquiring militarily the essential
resources for survival is relegated of necessity to a back seat.
<p>
The alternatives today are so narrow that we have but one choice a
continuance of the Price System which is war, or a discontinuance of
the Price System in order to achieve a potential peace.
<p>
For the first time in eight thousand years we in North America
represent an area population-the only area in the whole world which
can, by integration and coordination into a single, organic, social,
economic unit, insulate itself against war by virtue of its
preponderance of resources and its relatively small population. This
Continent alone has arrived at the stage where it can potentially
eliminate scarcity, even though it hasn't done so yet because of
restraints by the beneficiaries of the status quo. Because we have the
capacity to produce an abundance for all, we can eliminate strife
internally and make ourselves impregnable externally.
<p>
The idea that we can leave the solution of our problems to future
generations--that we should plan in terms of centuries, or even decades
and that abundance is something to be ushered in within the next fifty
years--is intolerable to us as we know it must be to you, because the
next five years will decide whether there will be any future decades
at all. These are the dynamic years when 50 million people were killed
in a five-year war, and when 50 million people can get killed in a
five-day war the next time!
