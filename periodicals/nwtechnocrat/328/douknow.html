...We, collectively, are very easily manipulated and deceived.  We 
are apathetic, largely influenced by what appears on T.V. and what 
we hear on the radio or read in newspapers.  We believe what we 
want to, not because it is so, but because it makes us 
comfortable.  We prefer not to consider the future consequences of 
our actions, even though they may seriously affect the lives of 
our children and grandchildren.  If we don't think seriously about 
our many problems then we don't feel impelled to do very much 
about them, and so social conditions continue to deteriorate while 
still we ignore them.  The way things are is largely of our own 
choosing; we accept, and our so-called leaders think we acquiesce.  
To improve we must change--and change drastically.  The Price 
System, based on commodity evaluation, must go to be replaced with 
a system operated on the basis of function that controls and 
operates technology to provide the maximum benefits for all -- 
controlling the physical equipment instead of people, while at the 
same time protecting the environment to the maximum possible for 
the future well being of this planet and all of its inhabitants.  
Technocracy has been saying for nearly sixty years that monetary 
restrictions would lead to the collapse of this system as we know 
it.  The evidence is mounting that this collapse is not too far 
distant.  
<p>
...As more technology is installed and its efficiency increases, 
jobs are displaced because machines are more effective, cheaper 
and pose no labour problems.  But they do not consume -- hence more 
productivity, fewer workers and decreased consumption.  Example:  
a new banking system to handle the 2.5 million credit card 
payments a month is being introduced; it will process 30,000 
payments an hour.  The present system handles 2,000.  It is 
therefore hardly surprising to find that the U.S. banking industry 
will eliminate about 100,000 jobs this year and approximately 
200,000 this decade.
<p>
...Living standards are declining, from 1969 to 1989, work hours 
increased for the average worker by one month a year, and they 
took 15% fewer days off.  Real wages have declined steadily since 
1973.  Increased housing costs, health care and the cost of all 
basic requirements have added to this decline in living standards.  
Double incomes are now a necessity for most families if they are 
to enjoy a reasonable life style.  Unfortunately, the ability to 
maintain a decent standard of life is becoming increasingly more 
difficult for more people.  In the U.S.A., 25% of all families are 
headed by single parents; this figure in 1970 was 11%.  The 
majority of single parents are women who on average earn only 75% 
of that of their male counterparts.  Debt, relative to income, 
rose sharply in the 1980s, making the U.S. the developed world's 
lowest savers.  In the decade 1960-70, savings represented 8% of 
income; today it is 5% and expected to fall.  More debt means less 
disposable income, which means less ability to purchase, which 
means less consumption, which means less business, which means 
less jobs, which leads to a declining tax base, which means more 
taxes for those still working and therefore less disposable income 
for them, which means etc., etc.
<p>
...As the business climate becomes less attractive, as government 
expenses rise, less money is available for research and development,
which means that innovations and discoveries essential for future
well-being and improved standards lags behind; this further erodes the
prospect for improved living standards in the future. The backbone of
any Price System economy is the middle class. In the last 15 to 20
years, the gap in wage scales between top and bottom wage earners has
increased rapidly -- very big increases at the top, significant losses
below -- again leading to a drop in consumption and a lowering of
living standards.
<p>
...Looming over all of these economic woes is the breakdown of the 
environment, rising population, a declining resource base, 
increasing poverty and disease.  None of today's complex problems 
can be dealt with within the framework of a Price System.  It is 
inadequate -- cannot cope with the magnitude of the problems that 
exist today.  It works reasonably well under scarcity conditions 
when hand tool methods are applied and human and animal muscle 
power are the main sources of energy.  It was not intended to cope 
with modern technological conditions wherein over 98% of 
everything we produce is done by extraneous energy.  Change in our 
methods of operation is long past due.  By our attitudes we have 
allowed this system to deteriorate to its present state; to change 
will require a tremendous change in attitude plus a realization of 
the limiting factors of the Price System.  Think about it, act 
upon it -- while there is still time.
