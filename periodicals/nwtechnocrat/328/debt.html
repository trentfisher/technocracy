The rapid increase in the federal debt and the total national debt 
has been necessary to stall off a complete collapse of the 
economic system (Price System) in the United States and Canada.  
Let's not postpone facing up to this any longer.  Refusing to 
admit that this collapse is imminent only reduces the time 
available to determine solutions.  This debt has been increasing 
at an ever faster pace for most of the years since about 1915.  In 
spite of the reasons handed out to the public, this increase has 
not been the result of "careless" or "unconscious" actions by 
leaders who enjoyed big spending.  It has resulted from attempts 
to postpone the "evil" day when this Price System could no longer 
be kept in operation.  If this were not so, then why has the debt 
growth continued almost without interruption for some 75 years.
<p>
The enormous increase in the ability to produce, with an actual 
decline in the man-hours required in the production process 
resulting from the greatest technological advance in history, has 
reduced the purchasing power per unit of production of the people 
of the U.S. and Canada.  The increased debt has been necessary to 
make up for this loss in order to maintain sales, to keep 
factories operating, to provide jobs and maintain a system of 
trade and commerce based on the value concepts of human labor.
<p>
It is obvious that North America has the production capacity to 
provide plenty for all its citizens.  The fact that 33 1/2 million 
Americans are living in poverty, that farm products are bought up 
and destroyed, is proof that the "system" is not working.  If this 
many people are falling through the cracks, then the whole system 
is cracked.  The S&L collapse is only a sample, among many, that 
the financial system is in trouble.
<p>
All these problems are not going away, and they are not going to 
be solved by "business as usual."  A complete redesign of the 
economic system, the whole Price System, will be required.  This 
is what Technocracy Inc. has been pointing out for the past 60 
years.
