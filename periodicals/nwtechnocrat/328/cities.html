<p>
Much has been learned about cities in the last several decades, 
and a lot of that learning has come from unpleasant experience 
that derives from an inappropriate method of social operation.  
The picture of future cities as seen by Technocracy comes from an 
understanding of a social system designed to be compatible both 
with physical reality and human nature.
<p>
So great is the effect of habit on the human animal that it 
becomes almost impossible for one to detach himself sufficiently 
to take an objective view of the subject of housing.  Our houses, 
and our buildings and structures, generally, resemble our clothing 
in that they attain a certain convention and thereafter we tend to 
accept them without further question.  It never occurs to us to 
ask whether the prevailing convention is better or worse than 
other possible styles.  The training of our architects is such as 
to tend to perpetuate this state of affairs.  The problem of 
designing buildings in accordance with the functions they are to 
perform seems rarely to have occurred to architects.
<p>
The successful architect of today is either one who has developed 
an architectural firm that receives commissions for designing 
large and expensive buildings, such as skyscrapers, hospitals, 
courthouses and the like, or else an individual practitioner who 
knows sufficiently well the pecuniary canons of good taste to 
receive commissions for the design of residences in the expensive 
residential sections of our cities and their suburbs.
<p>
If an architect wishes to be really "modern," he then proceeds to 
do something "different."  The two basic questions that seem never 
to occur in connection with these endeavors are: "What is the 
building for?" and "Would it be practicable to house the 
inhabitants of an entire continent in such structures?"
<p>
This brings us to the technological foundation of the whole 
subject of housing, namely, what are the buildings for?  What do 
we have to build them with?  What does it cost physically to 
maintain them?  And how long will they last?
<p>
The physical cost in this field is arrived at in the same manner as is
the physical cost in any other field.  If housing is to be adequate
and at the same time the physical cost of housing is to be kept at a
minimum, there is necessitated a complete revision of design,
construction, and maintenance in the whole field of housing.  It
requires that the construction of houses be kept at a minimum cost,
that the life of each house be a maximum, and that the cost of
maintaining each house, including heating and lighting, be a minimum.
It requires, furthermore, that the
materials used be those of which there is an ample supply for the 
construction and maintenance.  This immediately rules out the 
whole array of "modern" designs of metal houses, where the metal 
involved is chromium and other similar rare metals that are 
indispensable as alloys of steel and other metals for industrial 
uses.
<p>
Technocracy's job is to make North Americans aware of what 
the future holds, the dangers and the opportunity.  Once the 
public sees what the possibilities are with this new form of 
governance, surprising changes can unfold.
<p>
At present, cities grow with no direction; efforts to control them 
are only after the fact -- when a problem has already gotten out 
of control.  A city should be built only after research has 
determined where industries can best process natural resources and 
where the population needs or wants a city.
<p>
What are some aspects of such a city?  Experience has shown that 
humans do best if they are not crowded.  If more than 14 or 15 
thousand live close to one another, something is lost.  But, on 
the other hand, a community should be big enough so there can be a 
full range of facilities, schools, recreations and hospitals.  
Thus a city should be more vertical than sprawling, with trees, 
grass and open spaces.  Interesting studies have been made of how 
people utilize space and arrange their environment.  They need 
their privacy and at the same time they need to feel near other 
people.
<p>
It seems clear that the ground level of a city should be for 
people; services and vehicles should be sub-surface.  Today, 
street after street is lined with shops hawking merchandise and 
with the alleys and lanes clogged with vehicles and refuse.  
Transportation to places of work or interest can be by underground 
rapid transit, and many forms of rapid transit are waiting in the 
wings for the selection of designers who will have the job of 
harmonizing human desire with physical reality.
<p>
No doubt, the transition time to the new society will see much 
movement before people settle into new ways.  For instance, it 
will be a new thing for many people to discover leisure.  They 
will have the opportunity to discover their personal potential 
without the restriction of lack of time and money.  The privilege 
of acquiring one's needs and wants as a right of citizenship will 
likely have its reflection in the kind of patriotism elicited.
