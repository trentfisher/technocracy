Human beings can be viewed in many different ways.  Technocracy 
views human beings as energy consumers primarily.  The reasons for 
this are very important.  Technocracy has stated that the 
operations of the social mechanism are measurable in terms of 
energy. The human being is the final consumer of energy and the 
object of all energy transformations within the social system.
<p>
A human being is an energy consuming device.  So is an engine.  
This is a fact, not simply a way of viewing human activity.  We 
put fuel into an engine and the engine converts it to work, heat, 
and waste products.  When people eat, this is exactly what they 
do.  A calorie (a kilogram calorie is the actual unit being 
referred to) is a metric measure of energy consumption.  The 
energy in the food is converted by people's bodies to work, heat, 
and waste.  The human body is an engine.
<p>
Technocracy does not say this is all there is to a human being.  
Anyone who has ever given any thought to this question knows 
better than that.  But insofar as Technocracy is concerned, a 
human being is first an energy consuming device that must be 
provided for.
<p>
People that have had concern with the precise nature of human 
beings have been seeking to understand one of the major problems 
puzzling man throughout human history.  Nazi Germany was concerned 
with the development of the "perfect Aryan man."  They used this 
vision to classify many people they did not like as "subhuman."  
The slaughter of millions of human beings was the German 
fascists' attempt to rationalize an ideology.
<p>
The Communist Manifesto speaks of the development of the perfect 
selfless man:  "from each according to his abilities and to each 
according to his needs."  It speaks of the dictatorship of the 
proletariat to accomplish these ends.  In actual practice in the 
Soviet Union the dictatorship of the proletariat turned out to be 
one of the most Byzantine bureaucracies ever developed.  Like any 
bureaucracy, its primary interest was in preserving and extending 
its own privileges, if necessary at the expense of the society as 
a whole.  While it never could match the European fascists body 
for body, it was capable of very vicious behavior.
<p>
All of the great religious wars in history have mostly been 
involved with trying to save people from themselves.  If 
unsuccessful, at least they could annihilate the heathens. There are
plenty of outstanding examples of this in the world today.
<p>
One need only look at Afghanistan, El Salvador, Cambodia, and many
others. In Cambodia, the Pol Pot regime was trying to create the
perfect agrarian revolution.  To do this they executed about two
million of their own people. They forcibly marched all the city
dwellers out into the countryside, causing the collapse of the
economy. Anyone who was known to have an education or simply wore
glasses was executed.
<p>
The duty of a functional governance as proposed by Technocracy is 
to supply people with what they want, where they want it, at the 
time they want it.  As long as they are doing no harm to others, 
the "why" they want it is their own business.  We can arrange 
things so that we can assure ourselves that what we want is good 
for us and for the rest of society.  To accomplish this 
satisfactorily we must first assure ourselves that our governance 
is designed for the benefit of people and not profit.
<p>
Human beings are at the same time the most powerful, and as a 
result, the most dangerous form of life ever developed on this 
planet. The human brain consists of 75 billion cells.  The whole 
body contains 75 trillion cells.  Each cell has more chemical 
processes continuously in progress than all of the chemical 
factories on earth.  (<cite>Fit For Life</cite> by H. & M. Diamond)
<p>
Due to his command of technology, man has now taken command of 
his own evolution (for good or ill) as well as that of the other 
inhabitants of the planet.  (<cite>New World New Mind</cite>
by R. Ornstein & P. Ehrlich).
A human being is capable of adapting to a completely 
novel environment so rapidly and seamlessly that it appears to the 
individual involved that "it has always been this way."  (<cite>No 
Contest</cite> by Alfie Kohn)
<p>
"Where does the instability of the homogeneous come from?  Why 
does it differentiate spontaneously?  Why do things exist at all?  
Are they the fragile and mortal result of an injustice, a 
disequilibrium in the static equilibrium of forces between 
conflicting natural powers?  Or do the forces that create and 
drive things exist autonomously -- rival powers of love and hate 
leading to birth, growth, decline, and dispersion?  Is change an 
illusion or is it, on the contrary, the unceasing struggle 
between opposites that constitutes things?  Can qualitative change 
be reduced to a motion in a vacuum, of atoms differing only ion 
their forms, or do atoms themselves consist of a multitude of 
qualitatively different germs, each unlike the others?  And last, 
is the harmony of the world mathematical?  Are numbers the key to 
nature?"  (<cite>Order Out of Chaos</cite> by Ilya Prigogine & Isabelle 
Stengers)
<p>
Only a human being is capable of posing or pondering such 
questions.  Many of the things that make life worth living are not 
subject to measurement -- love,  beauty, wonder, pleasure, sorrow, 
the thrill of discovery, of conquest, achievement.  But for a 
social system to operate, it must be able to measure what it is 
doing. Technocracy proposed energy be used as the fundamental unit 
of the measurement of social activity because energy is the most 
fundamental measure of anything physical.  It also stated that as 
far as the operations of the social system is concerned, a human 
being is nothing more than an energy consuming mechanism.  This 
is not meant as a degradation, but to permit human development to 
proceed faster than ever before possible and with the greatest 
diversity of which we are capable.
