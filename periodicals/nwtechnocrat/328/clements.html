<p>
The recent riots in the city of Los Angeles could be the 
forerunner of things to come, and will be unless society abandons 
the old worn-out price system that we presently use in an attempt 
to distribute goods and services.  Only a social system such as 
Technocracy Inc. outlines can prevent the coming catastrophe.
<p>
The jury's verdict in the Rodney King case is called the cause of 
these city riots, but that verdict was only the spark that touched 
off the waiting powder keg of social unrest.
<p>
Poverty, unemployment, lack of medical attention, lack of proper 
schooling, these are the major causes of the anarchy that hit Los 
Angeles.
<p>
Politicians rush into the news media, blaming whichever party is 
the opposite to their own.  Newscasters, while supposedly 
reporting facts, slant the news to fit the political viewpoint of 
the broadcasting station.  Do gooders blame the lack of moral 
fiber in the masses; each group has its own scapegoat.
<p>
Technocrats of course know the answer -- they know that while all 
the above ills are blamable, those ills are only the indirect 
causes of the breakdown of law and order.  They know that there is 
no political answer to the problems that face us.
<p>
Increasing government handouts such as welfare payments or 
unemployment insurance can only temporarily stave off the coming 
catastrophe.
<p>
There can be no such thing as full employment of our available 
working force, for modern technology has made such employment 
impossible.  We now produce more and more goods with fewer and 
fewer workers.  What can we do with people who, through no fault 
of their own, have no paychecks with which to meet the costs of 
living?
<p>
The problem cannot be solved under the Price System; it can only 
get worse, for within the Price System are the seeds of its own 
destruction.  Television has made it possible for us to view the 
rioting as it occurred.  We saw the fires, the beatings, the 
looting, the madness of mob action before police and soldiers 
finally were able to restore some order.
<p>
But what if these riots were in all parts of many large cities at 
the same time?  Could we then supply enough law enforcement to put 
down these wide-spread insurrections?
<p>
Think of the streets clogged with wrecked vehicles, power shut 
off, water supply gone, no sewage disposal, the dead and dying 
lying in the wreckage of a city gone mad.
<p>
Each city then becomes a stinking pesthole from which people try 
to escape.  Murder becomes common, as people vie for food or means 
of getting out of the city.
<p>
This then is CHAOS!
<p>
Can we prevent such a calamity?  Yes, if we wake up in time.  We 
can throw out the archaic Price System and install Technocracy's 
plan for social survival.
<p>
We can have a society of people who need never be concerned with 
the necessities of life; people who, with a minimum amount of 
labor, can enjoy all the benefits of scientific production and 
distribution of goods and services.
<p>
We do not have a choice in this matter -- we do have a chance to 
avoid CHAOS.
