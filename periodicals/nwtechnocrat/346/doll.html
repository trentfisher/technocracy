<p>
The stripping of rainforests for monetary profit points up a vital
truth -- we are dead set on a collision course between human ambition
and the hard, cold realities of physical science.
<p>
The world operates on two economic systems.  The one is our true wealth,
the physical planet we inhabit and its many diverse and interconnected
systems -- of which we are a part.  All activities of this economy
are concrete, measurable quantities, based in physical science.  The
other economy, that dictates the thoughts and actions of commercial
society, is the financial one whereby we decide who gets how much
of the product of the natural economy.  The principles of this artificial
economy are not found in any book on physical science.  They exist
only in the murky and unfathomable depths of human imagination, opinion
and desire.  You can't eat this economy, drink it, or build a house
from it.  In this age of electronic funds transfer, it doesn't even
require physical evidence of itself.
<p>
It's no longer a matter of how we slice the pie.  It's a matter of
whether there is a pie at all.  You can't mix physical properties
with philosophical pecking orders, particularly in a social system
in which we perversely reward the consumers of resources with imaginary
tokens allowing them to consume more resources.  And, as resources
dwindle and become more precious, each of us is required to make even
more money to survive.  We are sacrificing the earth for a mess of
pottage, and misdirected technology has accelerated the trend. In
our headlong pursuit of financial "rewards", we have given little
thought to the very simple fact that it is the physical that supports
the financial -- not the other way around.  Yet even our efforts
to maintain a habitable planet must meet the criterion of "cost
effectiveness".  In
other words, even the fate of life on earth itself is subject to the
"What's in it for me?"  of monetary gain.
<p>
This is a point of distinction that somehow escapes even the most
die- hard of environmentalists, who cling to the myth that with the
coin of the realm, we can buy or bribe our way to ecological reclamation.
<p>
At the World Conference on Population in Cairo in 1994, Jacques Cousteau
made the following comment: "Let us jump ahead to the year 2030.  Then
the world's resources will be difficult to share.  Their fullness
can be evaluated today, using the most sophisticated science and technology
to obtain the best yield from them while using our sense of justice
to assure equitable distribution.  Energy will be the money of the
future, determining the real value of goods instead of basing the
economy on the desire of artificially tempted customers."  For the
record, at the rate we are rendering the earth uninhabitable for increasing
numbers of life forms, we probably do not have that long to go.
<p>
In 1933, The Continental organization of Technocracy made the same
pronouncement on the basis of an objective, non-political analysis
of available energy and resources, but they took it a step farther.  They
proposed a switch from a monetary economy to one based on physical
factors, and outlined a program for an orderly transition.  It even
provided a "sense of justice" in equal, but not identical, access
to goods and services for the entire population.  It is the only organization
in existence, or in history, to do so.
<p>
A world without money?  Or a world without resources?  There is no
middle ground.  Who knows?  Maybe we'll be able to survive on dollar-bill
sandwiches.  Maybe through some mysterious alchemy we can convert
all those computer bytes that represent our financial holdings into
topsoil or estuaries.  But somehow, it is doubtful.
