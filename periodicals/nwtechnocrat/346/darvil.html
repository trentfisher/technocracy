... The recently completed Presidential election in the U.S.
promised many things: jobs, a balanced budget, improved education,
improved health services, repairs to the infrastructure and a clamp-down
on crime and violence.  Business leaders promise that downsizing will
result in more efficiency and therefore more JOBS; and the old bugaboo
that refuses to die: more technology means more JOBS, even though
all indicators point to the exact opposite.  All of it hot air, meaningless
and misleading; but, even if it were attainable, would still leave
the far more urgent problems of the environment and how we are going
to sustain a livable planet to survive on.
<p>
... Resources are shrinking as population continues to rise.  Scarce
resources will lead to hostilities and war as nations compete for
declining resources.  One example is water.  Many rivers are shared
by two or more nations -- examples are: the Ganges, the Nile, the
Jordan, the Tigris-Euphrates, the Amu Dar'ya and the Syr Dar'ya.  The
Nile River, 86% of this river originates in Ethiopia -- a country
that expects to expand its irrigated lands and expand its hydro-electric
power.  This will severely impact the amount of water flowing into
Egypt, a country which receives hardly any rainfall.  Of all the water
on earth, only about 2.5% is fresh and 66% of this is locked in glaciers
and an ice cap.  The renewable fresh water supply on land, in the
form of precipitation, totals some 110,000 cubic kilometers annually,
a mere 0.000008% of all the water on earth.  A cubic km. (kilometer)
equals a billion cubic meters.  Each year nearly 66% of this renewable
supply returns to the atmosphere through evaporation or transpiration.  About
40,000 cubic kms. per year is run-off.  This run-off is the source
for all human use.  Fresh water is considered renewable, but it is
also finite; the land receives roughly the same amount of water today
as it did thousands of years ago.  Globally, water-use tripled between
1950 and 1990 and now is an estimated 4,430 cubic kms. -- 35% of
the accessible supply.  An additional 20% is used to dilute pollution,
sustain fisheries and transport goods.  Therefore, humans are already
using directly or indirectly, more than half the water supply that
is now accessible.  In the next 30 years population is expected to
increase by 2.6 billion people, the same as between 1950 and 1990.  But
worldwide water use cannot triple again, unless there is conservation,
pollution control, and an increase in the available water supply.  Globally,
water is in great excess, but because of operational limits and pollution,
it can, in fact, support only one more doubling of demand, which will
occur in the next 20 to 30 years.  If it was possible to stop all
pollution, trap every drop of flood- water, move either the people
to the water or the water to the people; and, even if it were possible
to capture the full 40,000 cubic kms. of annual run-off for human
use, there would only be enough water for 3 or 4 more doublings, a
mere 100 years away if current growth rates continue.
<p>
... Up to 1995 annual grain consumption averaged about 300 KG
(kilogram) per person, assuming that the global average remains at
today's levels.  Meeting the grain requirements of the projected world
population in the year 2025, would take an additional 780 billion
cubic meters of water.  If we assume that the non-grain portion requires
a third as much water to produce, as the grain based portion does,
the minimum amount of water used to produce an average diet, would
be about 400 cubic meters per person per year.  This means that to
meet the food requirements of the 2.6 billion people that are expected
to be added to the world's population by 2025, would take an additional
1,040 billion cubic meters of water, equal to more than 12 times the
average flow of the Nile river, or 56 times the average flow of the
Colorado river.
<p>
... The U.S.A., is in no position to be smug or complacent.  The
high- plains aquifer system, which underlies nearly 20% of all U.S.
irrigated lands, has been depleted now by some 325 billion cubic meters,
roughly 15 times the average annual flow of the Colorado river.  Over
66% of this depletion has occurred in the Texas high-plains where
irrigated areas dropped 26% between 1979 and 1989.  Current depletion
is estimated at 12 billion cubic meters a year.  California groundwater
overdraft averages 1.6 billion cubic meters per year.  66% of this
depletion occurs in the Central Valley -- that is this country's,
and many parts of the world's fruit and vegetable market.  In the
south-western U.S., overpumping in Arizona alone totals more than
1.2 billion cubic meters a year. East-of-Phoenix water tables have
dropped more than 120 meters.  Projections
for Albuquerque, New Mexico, show that if ground-water withdrawals
continue at current rates, water tables will drop an additional 20
meters, on average. by the year 2000.
<p>
... The problem related to water, is just one aspect of our
mounting inability to cope with conditions affecting our future
well-being.  Air
pollution, soil erosion, ground contamination, encroachment on wetlands
and agricultural land, destruction of forests, overfishing, are just
some of the other problems that affect our future well-being.  Contamination,
as the result of ill advised or dangerous practices, is all too common.  65,000
industrial chemicals are now in regular commercial use.  Toxicology
data are available on fewer than 1% of them.  Every day, three to
five new chemicals enter the marketplace.  80% of those chemicals
are not tested for toxicity.  Every day, one million tons of hazardous
waste are generated in the world, 90% of them in the industrialized
world.  On an average day in the U.S. there are five industrial accidents
involving hazardous wastes.
<p>
... Mexico City boasts the Western Hemisphere's filthiest air.  Ozone
levels in some parts of the city can reach as high as 274 points on
the government's metropolitan air pollution index, the Imeca scale,
exceeding the 250 point level at which a Phase 1 alert is called.  Levels
above 200 are considered dangerous to one's health.  Ozone levels
in the city routinely exceed the 100 point "safe" mark.  The Imeca
scale is far less stringent than international measures.  By World
Health Organization standard, Mexicans breathe unsafe levels of ozone
an average of five hours a day, all year long.
<p>
... Our ability to sustain life on this planet
much farther into the future is questioned by many prominent scientists
and others that study the ramifications of our continued onslaught
on this planet's life- support systems.  Listening to our politicians
and other advocates of the status quo, one would think that our only
problems were in providing more jobs and improving our business
techniques.  The
old English adage of "where there's muck there's brass" is still very
prevalent in the thinking of our so-called leaders.  This approach
has changed very little since the advent of the industrial revolution.  As
we are fed this nonsense on a daily basis, it is little wonder that
most people swallow this dangerous stupidity, and, in large part,
go along with the absurdities presented by politicians and their business
masters.  Unfortunately we are paying, and will continue to pay, a
high price for going along with the practices of the status quo.  As
we have barely touched on in this column, the onslaught we are inflicting
on this planet, in a mindless pursuit of the bottom line, will have
disastrous consequences if not soon arrested.  We cannot continue
for too much longer to be guided by the short-term monetary expediency
dictated by a system that affects its distribution of goods and services
by means of commodity valuation, employing any form of debt token
or money.  If we are to survive as a species, we must be guided by
function.  We must do what has to be done to arrest our growing population,
conserve our resources, protect the environment and, generally, whatever
is necessary to protect our future and that of our children and grandchildren
and, for that matter, future generations.  Money can play no part
in this; it is inhibiting and limiting in its application; it only
allows for the exchange of a scarcity and can play no part in planning
for the continuation of a high-energy civilization.  Energy dictates
our lives in the form of technology; it must be operated for the benefit
of humankind, not to our detriment.  A functional government would
use energy-accounting as a medium of distribution and also as a means
of keeping a running inventory of goods produced, services supplied,
and the amount of unused energy still available for use.  What is
needed is a concept of government in keeping with the age in which
we live.  Technocracy is such a concept.  Investigate it; time is
running out.
