Jim Wallis,
<br>
First United Methodist Church 423 Martin Luther King
Jr. Way, Tacoma, WA
<p>
Dear Mr. Wallis:
<p>
Every now and then the public is fortunate in having
the opportunity to read of an effort and concern that has real
significance.  Your
interview in the Saturday edition of the Tacoma News Tribune is one
such occasion.
<p>
There are many people who believe that we only need
to become more devout, to put religion in schools or some other religious
or righteous cause and then our problems will diminish.  For some
people this might be a good idea, but it does not address the fundamentally
grave problems that confront Christian and non-Christian alike.
<p>
I am sure there are many people fervently praying that
their only means of support through welfare will not cease, but it
looks like that will happen.  There is a saying in the Christian Bible,
"Render unto Caesar that which is Caesar's" or some such.  But what
of Caesar's responsibility to society?  In Caesar's day, the very
few had the larger share.  It could not change much even if Caesar
had ordered it so, because there was not enough to divide into a larger
population.  That is not the situation today.
<p>
The use, or more correctly, the misuse of modern technology
has put more and more people into the category of irrelevancy in the
need of producing goods and services.  This trend is unidirectional
and irreversible.  The false statistics we hear about the low unemployment
rate and job creation are just that.  False.  Employment whereby a
family can support itself even moderately has fallen drastically.  That
is not the case for the very few.  The era of the Caesar's is upon
us again except we have warehouses bulging with un-sold products.
<p>
The people you are trying to represent, to help, no
longer have a stake in our present economic system.  Their ranks will
continue to swell until the social pressure cooker explodes.  Our
only alternative to social turmoil is to address the real problems
facing our country, and you will not find any solutions in the present
system because the system must maintain the old and outdated rules
established in the days of scarcity.
<p>
Many years ago, the impact of what is happening to our
civilization was predicted by a scientific research organization called
the Technical Alliance.  I will not go into the history of that time,
except to say that their 14 years of analysis of our modern problems
resulted in the formulation of a scientific social design that could
bring our society into accord with the new conditions.  The earlier
organization then became known as Technocracy Inc. and attracted a
volunteer membership throughout the North American Continent.  Technocracy
is not a political, religious or philosophical organization.  Technocracy
has one goal and that is to inform the people of this area of an alternative
to the destructive mode of operation that now plagues our nation.
<p>
In the not so distant future our society will be confronted
with decisions when only correct information will be of help.  We,
as members of Technocracy, are doing our best to see that the people
have a chance to have that information put before them.
<p>
Respectfully,
<p>
George Wright, Staff Coordinator, The Northwest Technocrat
