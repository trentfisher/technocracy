<p>
Isn't it a shame indeed<br>
That man cannot see past his greed<br>
To see a planet's dying plead<br>
To only produce what we need<br>
<p>
The profit system only abuses<br>
A need to make more than one uses<br>
This glut of THINGS only forces<br>
The plunder of our natural resources<br>
<p>
This may sound odd and really funny<br>
But think what would happen without any money<br>
Crime would slowly fade away<br>
When people get used to living that way<br>
<p>
This idea is not new, nor is it mine<br>
Technocracy has been around for quite some time<br>
We could all live well and really be free<br>
With a system based on energy<br>
<p>
Think of how it would free the scholars<br>
If education wasn't locked in by dollars<br>
Medicine would grow by leaps and bounds<br>
If not reined in by dollar hounds<br>
<p>
The only limits man would find<br>
Would be in the working of his mind<br>
He could take hold of his thoughts and run<br>
And by golly, when you think about it ... wouldn't it be fun!
