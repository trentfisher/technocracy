Here in the Pacific Northwest, local news of late has been reporting
on how well some industries in our area are faring.  The Boeing Company
has just logged it's best year for commercial aircraft orders.  Many
other industries, some related, also have been producing record levels
of profits.  It would seem that Seattle's future looks very bright.  For
some of us that have survived the recent downsizing and lay-offs,
that may be quite true.  The Boeing Company, because of its success,
will be rehiring some of the people who were earlier discharged.
<p>
We, in this area, must feel relieved that our main employer has done
so well.  But what of the people who used to work for the Lockheed
Aircraft Company?  And, Martin Marietta and General Dynamics had been
large players in the industry as well.  And now MacDonald Douglas;
we don't hear much about them anymore.  Except for Boeing and Airbus,
the European Consortium and all the others have mostly been relegated
to minor support roles employing fewer people.
<p>
If we try to analyze the significance of this information, we should
come to the conclusion that even with the need for large new aircraft
fleets, there is no longer a need for a large aircraft industry.  Could
it be that technology and simplified systems have eroded the demand
for human labor?  Analyzing this situation; we arrive at that conclusion.  We
can see the same effects in most other industries as well.  One may
argue that the expansion of technology has created many new positions
or jobs.  And, if we consider the service sector and other marginal
occupations, with lower wage scales, this may be true.  But the time
that it takes to produce anything has changed dramatically downward,
and the net result is that the basis of our ancient economic system
whereby we must "labor for our bread" is no longer valid.
<p>
We, as a society, have not, as yet, come to recognize the significance
of the use of our technology.  For the first time in the history of
humanity, a society of people has developed the ability to go beyond
the mere struggle for existence.  Just think of it:  Computers, spaceships,
automobiles, television, telephones, a full array of technological
wizardry.  We have an agricultural system that not only supplies the
needs for it's own, but has been able to divert surpluses to other
parts of the world.  Yet, something is very wrong with the scene we
see all aroung us today.  At this moment, the political leadership
of our country is locked in heated debate as to how they can best
eliminate services to people.  They are trying to decide who among
us is more qualified or deserving of the diminishing tax dollars to
be distributed.  Should it be a tax forgiveness for business, or maybe
an outright monetary gift?  And what of the so-called "entitlements",
such as social security, welfare and medical aid for the elderly.  The
course of action that the politicians feel they must take is --
that in order to salvage our financial system, they must reduce or
eliminate what had been achieved in social, environmental and economic
services.
<p>
Ironically, many of the social programs in question were instituted
in a time of severe national and international financial distress.  The
leadership at that time was forced to contain social unrest, and,
as a consequence, they put in place some props to the Price System.  What
then has changed to make our position so precarious now that we must
start to dismantle the very systems that resuscitated the money system?  If
we analyze the situation, we would see that the use of vast amounts
of debt have been the real salvation for a failing system.  And, with
the ever increasing technological displacement of tax generating occupations,
more and more debt has been needed to off-set that impact and to pay
the interest on that debt.  Today, we find ourselves in debt by trillions
of dollars and climbing.
<p>
Whether we like it or not, the people of North America will have to
face the fact that we cannot for very much longer, continue with the
present method of operation.  What is needed is a system that is designed
to address and rectify the problems brought about by the misuse of
technology.  The word "misuse" is an important distinction.  We can
not do what the Luddites* of earlier industrial England tried
to do -- destroying the machines that they felt were stealing their
jobs.  We have become so dependent on our technology that any sabotage
of that kind would grind our country to a stand-still.
<p>
For many years now, there has been available for the consideration
of the people of North America, a scientific social design for the
functional control of the physical operations of our land area.  That
design is called Technocracy, and is the culmination of over a decade
of scientific research.  It is not a political party that can only
offer cosmetic changes, and it is not a religious or philosophical
ideology that suggests that if we somehow change our behavior, things
will work out.  Allegiance to some political charmer or chanting a
mantra will not keep all the technical service lines open that we
need for survival.
<p>
Never before has it become so imperative that we arm ourselves with
correct information.  Without proper knowledge we will never institute
a system that allows all people access to the benefits that our technology
can provide for us.  Without proper knowledge, we will continue to
over-populate our planet.  Without proper knowledge we will continue
to use our limited resources as fast as the "market place" will bear.  Without
proper knowledge we will not survive.
<p>
Investigate Technocracy.  Arm yourself with the proper knowledge.
<p>
*Footnote: <EM>"Luddite" (from Webster) -- One of a body
of English workmen who from 1811 to 1816 endeavoured to prevent the
introduction of labor-saving machinery by burning factories and destroying
machines: said to be named after Ned Lud, an imbecile who broke two
improved stocking frames.  [Another source of information claims that
Ned Lud could very well be deserving of the description "imbecile"
for daring to confront a "boss" of a textile mill at that time in
history.]</EM>
