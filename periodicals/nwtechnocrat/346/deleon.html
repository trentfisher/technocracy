<p>
In an era when North Americans should be rejoicing from the
fruits of their own inventiveness, change is lapping with an ominous
threat at all our doorsteps.  What threat?  It is a gnawing fear of
the future.  As business failures multiply; as the unemployment rolls
lengthen; as little farms are swallowed up by big ones, and as war
continues to hang relentlessly over our heads, every segment of our
society seems to stand on the quaking ground of uncertainty.
<p>
Workers "especially" face increasing uncertainty as job opportunities
diminish, and relief and security funds are dissipated.  As jobs are
taken over by technology, workers are finding, today, that they are
not fitted for many of those technological jobs that are said to be
available.  Retraining and reschooling do not seem to answer their
questions either, as there are simply not enough jobs to go around.  We
hear on the news that maybe 1500 jobs are being created -- but
how is that supposed to give jobs to the many thousands of people
being laid off.
<p>
Fortunately, of late, North Americans in increasing numbers
are beginning to re-examine critically our economics in all its aspects
and to assess its effectiveness in relation to their own lives.  Manifestly
something is bringing a threat to them and some have concluded that
if our own way of life creates problems that it is incapable of solving,
the solution must be looked for elsewhere.  And most North Americans
are not expecting to find the answer in some worn-out, discredited
and foreign social system. They are looking for an efficient North
American solution to our North American problems.
<p>
The advance of technology is no longer limited to the fields
of production where it has been making such devastating inroads in
the blue-collar jobs.  It is also making deep inroads in areas never
before invaded.  The white-collar workers in the managerial, supervisory
and service fields are falling before the computers like wheat before
the reaper, and not only in the business world.  Clerks, accountants,
typists and stenographers in administrative offices of cities, counties,
states, municipalities and national government are rapidly losing
their jobs to technology.
<p>
In this re-assessment of our society, one of the functions
which should be getting an especially hard look is our educational
system.  Since our problems are rapidly multiplying, we must conclude
that our educational system also is involved in those problems.  And
to confirm this conclusion, more and more voices of anxious educators
and government officials are being added to those who warn of the
dangers of ignoring our educational trend.  They point to the over-crowded
classrooms and inadequate facilities.  The deplorable results of such
faults can often be found in our increased unemployment, delinquency
and crime.  And since the educational system is the fulcrum upon which
the whole society rests, failure in its cardinal objective -- that
of giving youth the means by which it can make its way in our changing
world, can only mean that it has also failed society as a whole, and
that it must be changed.
<p>
Unfortunately our education system, along with most of the
functions of our society, is closely tied to, and controlled by,
business-oriented
politics which, by its self-perpetuating nature, hampers and obstructs
social progress.  This is not new.  Such control has always existed
in our society, and, in the interest of maintaining the status quo,
is the very warp and woof of the Price System.  But as long as the
advance of science maintained a slow pace, this control exerted little
damage to society as a whole or to education which was then more or
less adequate to its task.
<p>
Of late, amid mounting conditions of deprivation and breakdown
that are building up, and in the absence of any valid reason for war
other than the usual palliatives of business and politics, there is
a heartening stir among our youth, who are objecting to this.  No
doubt in our manic obsession with preventing social change at all
costs, the concept of social change will for some time remain a vile
and communicable disease, unless youth take destiny into their own
hands by actively objecting.  In which case, schools will be compelled
to prepare our young for the world that exists for them, instead of
turning out the largest crops of brainwashed mediocrity the world
has ever witnessed.
<p>
<h3>THE PRICE OF FAILURE</h3>
<p>
There is no doubt that for the failures of our educational
system, North American youth pays the heaviest price.  Coming through
this mental reducing plant they are not only squeezed dry of initiative,
but emerge with a negative outlook born of frustration and fear --
being completely unready for the world that confronts them.  Granted,
that they are technically prepared for a job they may be able to find,
but they have not been prepared to meet the tremendous and constant
changes taking place in our world today.  The basic trends of their
world are largely unknown to them, and when they lose their job, an
eventuality which is overtaking millions of our North American workers
per year, the very foundations are ripped out from under, then leaving
them helpless.
<p>
The lack of challenge in our education shows up in the bright
youngsters who drop out of school; they are lost not only to themselves
but to society forever.  And one must shudder to contemplate how many
doctors and how many scientists, how many technologists, engineers
and others with their needed skills are thus lost.  It could be that
one of them would find the needed cure for cancer.
<p>
Other grim statistics pertaining to our youth cast doubt
upon the worthiness of our education.  Evidently, so lacking in the
teaching of the fundamentals of social living and those elements that
go into the building of character, our youth fall prey in unbelievable
numbers to dope-addiction, juvenile delinquency, venereal disease,
illegitimacy, crime, insanity and suicide, all of which have increased
staggeringly in recent years.
<p>
<h3>TECHNOCRACY'S POSITION</h3>
<p>
Technocracy states that it will not be possible within the
framework of the Price System to support an educational system which
is consonant with the needs of our technological age.  Government
assistance to education will continue to be anathema so long as politics
and business are in the saddle; and there will remain, in connection
with schools, the same old invitation to venality and crookedness,
even though their results are disastrous to society and youth.  An
instance of the tight control in education can be seen in the medical
field where many youngsters aspiring to enter that field are thwarted
in getting the education necessary for it.  This has come through
the interference to organize medicine in an effort to keep its own
product, medical care, scarce, and therefore costly.  But of late
there have been outcries from the furtherseeing members of the
profession.  Doctors, and nurses too, are following the money!
<p>
Technocracy has recognized all the foregoing social ills.  It
has emphatically warned that none of those ills can be overcome except
through a complete social change involving the entire North American
Continent; and that until this is done, only symptoms of our outworn
system can at best be ineffectively dabbed at.
<p>
Technocracy also recognizes that change will not come easily
to the minds of people. Although North Americans have come through
an unprecendented transition from a hand-tool to a technological age,
we still resist the very thought of a scientific social change.  We
are not alone among the various species in this reluctance to change.  We
share this dubious honor with the dinosaur, the mastodon and the saber-toothed
tiger, each of which died as a species rather than change.  But North
Americans will soon be called upon to make a choice as to whether
we will go on to annihilation or reverse our direction toward survival.
<p>
Our choice, either intelligent or stupid, will depend upon
the sum total of our knowledge of the facts pertaining to our world.  And
this in turn depends upon the education we receive.
<p>
Through the ages, those who sought to bring progress through
the enlightenment of minds were often pilloried, burned at the stake,
or exiled.  But Technocracy wishes to point out that this did not
stop either progress or relentless change.  As modern North Americans
who have reached an entirely new plateau of living, higher than even
our grandparents knew, and in which we accept without question shiny
cars and household gadgets, we will have to learn to accept yet another
fact; that in order to keep what we have achieved, we will have to
go the full way with science.  There is no place to stop.  It will
not be easy for many of us to overcome a reluctance; and for this
fear and hesitation, our schools are to a considerable degree responsible.
<p>
It is thus that our youth can learn not only to serve their
own needs and the needs of their society, but also to set an example
for the rest of the world -- and it is about time we got started
on this!  For until we have cleaned up our own social chaos, what
we say to the rest of the world cannot be heard above the noise of
what we fail to do!
