Patriotism means many things to many people.  While Noah Webster defines
it as "love of country," or "devotion to the welfare of one's country,"
it has otherwise somewhat contemptuously been described as "the last
refuge of the scoundrel."  Certainly, more national and international
chicanery is perpetrated in the name of "patriotism" than any other
word in the dictionary.
<p>
Most people want to be patriotic.  Most of them think they are.  But
the term has been bandied around so loosely by political self-seekers,
propagandists and other status quo champions that its real meaning
has been lost to them.
<p>
To the average person, patriotism infers loyalty to a politically-defined
area and its prevailing ideological form of government within a usually
larger geographical mass of land.  This concept demands an almost
fanatical devotion to that political realm from its residents, even
though, because of a too large population within a too-small or mismanaged
land area, they may be experiencing severe physical discomfort.
<p>
In the course of time, certain nations have established parliamentarian
forms of political government wherein opposing parties -- only
superficially different -- strive for control through the ballot.  During
their campaigns to induce the electorate to vote them into positions
of national responsibility, candidates will stop at nothing to vilify
or castigate their opponents.  Then, having called their opponents
national traitors, they fervidly declare their own unshakeable
patriotism.  This is a negative and destructive technique.
<p>
Fundamentally, patriotism is a much deeper thing.  In its most profound
sense, it is undivided loyalty to the physical entity of the land
from which one derives their living -- not to the superimposed
form of governance.  This governance merits support only so long as
it effectively produces and distributes vital goods and services to
all citizens.  When it fails to perform this basic purpose to all
of society, though the means to do it are abundantly at hand, it should
be discarded.  It is unpatriotic to support it.
<p>
Humans being physical organisms, derive their sustenance from the
earth.  Our vast and intricate web of productive and distributive
equipment, that provides us with food, clothing, shelter, transportation
and communication, had its roots in the earth -- aided by all-important
sunlight.  Somewhere along the line, we've got our wires crossed.  Whereas
society was originally and primarily designed to serve the needs of
its members, we now see this fundamental purpose being subverted to
the point where its members live -- and die -- for the aggrandizement
and glorification of that society.  We have become enslaved to the
very instrument contrived for our benefit.  Our present society, far
from being recognized as a means to an end, is considered as an end
in itself.
<p>
We have the incongruous picture of people swearing allegiance to mere
symbols of political entities that wear the guise of the nations within
which they reside.  Frequently, those nations, being mere outgrowths
of small societies, are too small for the land therein to support
the existing population, yet the same hysteria for national sovereignty
is maintained.  It assumes an even more ridiculous aspect, with citizens
showing narrower "patriotism" toward smaller segments of a nation,
such as provinces or states, municipalities, cities or even tiny villages.
<p>
Pride of development is a natural inclination and should be encouraged,
but since the so-called "patriotism" is more of a political than a
physical nature, it achieves no worthwhile purpose.  The smaller the
unit, the more dependent it is upon the facilities of the rest of
the land area for its necessities, and of course this situation reaches
its ultimate phase in urban centers that are totally dependent upon
outside resources and their development.  Accordingly, it is nonsensical
to display allegiance toward the political administrations of these
small political areas, for they form obstructions to the free flow
of physical commodities.
<p>
Cities and towns, within limits, at least afford some degree of physical
and social advantage to their residents who, for the most part, prefer
community existence.  Provinces, states and other subdivisions cannot
claim even this distinction.  A Continental concept of patriotism
on a physical basis is the only one completely adequate to the needs
of the people living within that area.
<p>
For the most part, our congenital and social stupidity prevents us
from abandoning our attitudes of nationalism and even imperialism.  Empires
have arisen partly because more land was required to support growing
populations at home, but more-so to bolster the weakening economic
positions of financial interests.  Those captains of industry, being
the chief beneficiaries of the low-cost raw materials received by
military and political pressure from third-world countries, control
the economies and hence the future aspirations of these respective
countries.  Naturally, they indulge in propaganda campaigns to imbue
those people with "patriotic" fervor for the continued progression
and enrichment of their business empires.
<p>
North America today has the most highly integrated social mechanism
and the greatest array of technological equipment for the production
of goods and services that has ever existed anywhere at any time.  If
it were to cease operating for an extended period of time, 85% of
the population would shortly perish -- irrespective of the futile
manipulations of business and politics.  All the ingredients are here
to provide a standard of living for everyone many times higher than
the present average and to ensure its maintenance for an indefinitely
long time into the future.
<p>
Yet most people, including many in fairly remunerative positions,
are constantly haunted by the specter of insecurity.  Society has
failed us.  Despite our physical ability to supply all citizens with
abundant shelter, food and clothing -- plus many luxuries --
our society has muffed its responsibility.  None too efficient even
under the scarcity conditions that for natural physical reasons prevailed
when it started, our Price System society is totally incapable of
coping with the abundance that our science and technology has produced.  Why,
then, do we persist treasonably in trying to maintain it when for
many years a design of operation especially tailored to the requirements
of a high-energy, technological mechanism has been available and
ready for use?
<p>
Adoption of this design will once again place society in it's proper
relationship.  It hardly need be added that with the citizens' needs
and comforts being of prime consideration, careful, scientific husbandry
of the land and all natural resources will automatically result.  Technocracy's
program for the North American Continent is one of foremost intelligence
and patriotism.
