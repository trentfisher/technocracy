Stella K. Block died on November 1, 1996.  She was a long-time member
of the Organization, Technocracy Inc. and an integral part of it.  She
joined Technocracy Inc., on December 12, 1938 and became part of the
Continental Headquarters staff in 1965.  She was one of the last members
to have worked closely with the founder of Technocracy Inc., Howard
Scott.
<p>
Stella contributed to the work of Technocracy Inc. in many important
and diverse ways:  She was the organization's Secretary, Treasurer,
as well as President of North American Associates.  She also wrote
extensively for the magazines and contributed ideas for many of the
"Briefs"; the popular "Brief" WOMEN was devised and written by her.  She
corresponded with many individuals and groups in her continuing quest
to inform and acquaint as many people as possible about Technocracy.
<p>
Stella was an interesting and stimulating person to be with and her
interest and knowledge on a wide range of subjects was evidence of
her continuing quest to obtain relevant information.  She was dedicated
to the stated goals of Technocracy, and to that end she devoted her
life in an unswerving service to Technocracy.  To the very end she
was alert and interested in everything around her.
<p>
To all who knew Stella, she was an example, someone to look up to,
and who, by her standards, provided leadership.  We who knew her,
loved and respected her.  The members of Technocracy Inc. owe her
a debt of gratitude.  She will be sorely missed, but will remain in
the hearts and minds of us all.  Thank you Stella, you made a great
contribution to humanity.
