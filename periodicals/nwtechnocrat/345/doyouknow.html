... According to Statistics Canada, single family incomes in
1961 outnumbered two-income families by 3.5 to 1.  By 1991, this ratio
had been reversed; two-income families now exceeded single incomes
by 3 to 1.  This has resulted in enormous change: stressed out families,
neglected children, and two people working to accomplish what once
was performed by one.  Thirty-nine percent of the workforce is now
considered to be part-time -- 5% higher than in 1989.  As the work-force
shrinks and overall income declines, the scale tips more in the other
direction.
<p>
... The world's 358 billionaires have a combined net worth of
$760 billion, equal to that of the bottom 45% of the world's population;
or that the average CEO in the U.S. now brings home about 149 times
the average factory worker's pay.  In 1995, chief executive officers
of the top companies in the U.S. made an average of over $4.3 million
a year, about $12,000 a day.  Someone on minimum wage made $8,500
a year.  In other words, a top CEO made more in one day than a minimum
wage worker made in over a year.  As more technology is introduced,
as the time-rate of doing work expands, the down-sizing will accelerate,
and more power will fall into fewer hands.  More than a quarter of
the world's economic activity now comes from the 200 largest corporations.  Up
to a third of all world trade takes place internally among different
units of global companies.
<p>
... Money, as we know it, is dying.  Bitbux, E-Cash, Cybercash,
Netbills, Digicash, and Mondex, are just some of the forms of bank
and non-bank pseudo-wealth passing through trademark and patent offices
or are already in experimental use.  It will be money that weighs
nothing and moves at the speed of light.  The average "smart card"
is a chip embedded in plastic.  It can store about 80 times as much
information as the typical magnetic stripe on a credit card.  Technocracy
spoke of energy-accounting in its inception over 60 years ago; it
is now close to reality.  We need only to replace this system that
exchanges its goods and services on the basis of commodity valuation,
using any form of debt-token or money, with a system using energy
as a basis of measurement, and we will then be well on the way to
solving most of our social problems -- the technology is in place;
why not utilize it for the benefit of all?  This monetary economy
is based on nothing but confidence -- your confidence, habit or
faith; it is a faith as powerful and essential to modern life as any
religious belief, and just as tenuous; but now it is misplaced.
<p>
... In today's economy, one sees or hears almost daily of lay-offs,
or firings.  Those words have a nasty connotation, and, in the spirit
of George Orwell's "new-speak", some of the larger companies are changing
their phraseology; they no longer speak of lay-offs or firings, but
now refer to: "Release of resources", "Career-change opportunity",
"Strengthening global effectiveness", "Involuntary severance", "Elimination
of employment security policy".  If only their creativity extended
to some beneficial ideas.
<p>
... We, as a people, have yet to face up to the challenges of
rising population, declining resources and the probable effects of
global warming.  With the projected increase in population in China,
and without any rise in consumption, China's demand for grain will
increase from 335 million tons in 1990 to 479 million tons in 2030.  This
would leave a shortfall of 216 million tons, a level that exceeds
the world's entire 1993 grain exports of 200 million tons.  Where
is the extra grain to come from?  The U.S.A.?  Highly unlikely, the
U.S. population is expected to grow by 95 million over the next 4
decades; the U.S. will also face a shortfall as demand for food grows.  During
this time more cropland and water will be lost to non-agricultural
use.  Other areas of the world will also face large population increases
with the resulting demand for more food combined with a shrinking
agricultural base.  The world's reserves of grain are now down to
49 days of consumption, and global grain production hasn't risen in
the past five or six years.  A serious crop failure in any of the
grain growing areas of the world would have calamitous effects.
<p>
... We pour 60 million tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere
daily by the burning of fossil fuels and the cutting down and burning
of forests.  What effect will this have on our future ability to grow
food?  Satellite photographs show that five percent of the ice floating
in the Arctic Ocean has disappeared.  Those photos show that an area
equal to twice the size of Norway has lost it's ice since the mid
1970s.  This probably doesn't raise sea levels, because the ice was
already floating.  A similar occurrence in Antarctica would raise
sea levels appreciably and cause widespread flooding.  We should be
taking steps to counteract those trends, but, in a social system where
the bottom line is the ultimate, this is not going to happen.
<p>
... The population projections being made for the next several
decades are probably not going to occur.  This planet, together with
all the problems we are causing, cannot sustain such growth.  If we
do not effectively cope with these problems, nature will, and we will
not like that eventuality.
<p>
... The many problems confronting us today are made by us --
and can only be resolved by us.  The resources are still available;
the technology is in place; the personnel, with the necessary knowledge
and expertise, are likewise in place.  What is needed is the realization
of the seriousness of the problem to make people demand a change.  To
do this they must be informed; but, this they are not.  They are,
by and large, mis-informed; the information is available; one just
has to look for it.  However, the necessary information will not be
found on TV, radio, or in newspapers -- but in journals and organizations
more concerned with the facts than in ratings or advertising revenues.
<p>
... Technocracy is such an organization; it has been attempting
to inform the people of North America of the urgent need for social
change for the last 60 years.  In fact, it is the only organization
that is attempting to prepare the people of this continent for viable
social change.  We must stop looking for short-term economic expediency
-- crying -- "Me"! "Me"! "Me"! "Now"! "Now"! "Now"!  Such noise
must be replaced with a look to the long-term survival of our species.  It
can be done.  All that is needed is the will for intelligent change;
all else is in place.
