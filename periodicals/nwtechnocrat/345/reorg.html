<hr>
THE CONTINENT of North America is a social Area, having the
soil, climate, resources and population to make it a self-contained
and self sustaining social unit. It also has the knowledge, the personnel
and the technology to install an efficient, low-cost operation with
abundance and a high standard of general welfare for its inhabitants.  What
is lacking is the proper organization -- an integrated, efficient,
Continent-wide organization designed to produce the most for the least
cost in human effort, natural resources and energy.  Trade and cultural
intercourse with the rest of the world, while desirable and in some
ways beneficial to North Americans, are only incidental to the operation
of this Continent; they are certainly not crucial.
<p>
Before attempting to comment on Technocracy's projected reorganization
of the Continent, we might try to visualize this Continental area
without social organization of any kind (although we realize that
such a condition could be only hypothetical).  Under such a condition,
each individual would be free of all social regulation as well as
benefits, being a truly rugged, anarchistic individual.  An individual
might be respectful of the ``rights'' of others or might be predatory
and homicidal in behavior.  There would be no law or other control
over that person, other than the possibility of reprisal by individuals.  There
would be no cooperative effort and no division of labor.  Each individual
would have to be self-sustaining.
<p>
The very nature of human reproduction requires that humans form family
or communal units for the care and protection of the children; hence,
absolute anarchy is out of the question.  With family life, there
comes a primitive order of organization.  It might be a loose,
mutually-cooperative group; but more likely it would be a patriarchal
(possibly sometimes a matriarchal) tyranny.
<p>
It is only a matter of social evolution, step by step, through family
groups, small tribes, large tribes confederations of tribes, and nations
until we have huge populations more or less integrated under a loose
sort of social organization, such as in the major nations and empires
of today.  This evolution, however, has been neither tranquil nor
continuously progressive.  It is blemished with hostilities and slaughters,
as well as with massive destruction of man's works.  Had there been
a harmonious progression from the early family organizations to modern
continental organizations, characterized by mutually cooperative endeavor
and stimulated with a unified social objective, it is a certainty
that the resulting accomplishment would be far advanced over anything
on the earth today, and there would not have been the high cost in
hardship, waste, frustration and bloodshed that our history records.  There
would now be social tranquility and an easier way of life for everyone.  But
social organization is a new thing for the human species, speaking
in anthropological terms, and it has progressed slowly and painfully
through trial and error plus the obstacles of human cussedness.  In
the end, human society may prove to be a biological failure, leaving
nothing but scars on the surface of the earth to show (to the uncomprehending
denizens of a new wilderness) that there ever had been such a thing
as human social organization.  Or human society can move on to new
heights and achieve such functional harmony that it shall endure as
long as life on the earth itself.
<p>
In the course of social evolution, there have crept into it certain
tendencies that have proven destructive to social organization over
the long term, but under the circumstances which fostered them in
the beginning, they had survival value.  One of those tendencies was
that of competitiveness.  This tendency developed in part from a struggle
for the necessities of life which were scarce.  Later, competition
provided more drama than did cooperation; hence, it stimulated more
immediate interest among the people, so its perpetuation was encouraged.  But
competition set man against man and group against group until, now,
it has reached the point where virtually half the world is pitted
against the other half.  Whatever may be said for the productive stimulus
derived from competition, it can be countered by manifold examples
of destructiveness spawned by it.
<p>
Another tendency has been that of acquiring property rights.  This
grew up naturally and gradually from the simple possession of personal
items, to where it proceeded to other things, including human beings
(beginning with wives and children), and eventually came to ownership
over real estate, slaves and commodities, as well as the means of
production.  In time, possession became a passion and a symbol of
social prestige.  The struggle for individual possession has underlain
much of the competiveness that has bedeviled human society.  Most
wars have been fought with the hope of gaining possessions, if not
as the major motive, at least as a prominent secondary motive.  The
acquisitiveness for possessions on a large scale led to the formation
of corporate structures, designed to wage massive economic competition
within and against society.  This trend has become so vicious that
the major corporations on this Continent regard their service to society
as merely incidental to their accumulation of wealth, while the customers
are regarded as the ``enemy'' -- to be looted for all they have plus
all they can borrow.  Recently, most of the public domain of the United
States has slipped into private hands.  The struggle is now on among
the economic giants for the sole ownership of the earth and all that
is on it.
<p>
A third tendency has been that toward authoritarian power.  This tendency
has closed in on humanity from three directions -- political, economic
and ecclesiastical.  Authoritarianism among humans presumably began
in the primitive family organization, where the male assumed a position
of dominance over other members of the family.  Later, among the early
barbarian tribes, authority resided in the political chief, the medicine
man and the wealthy landowners and merchants.  In order to standardize
and impersonalize this authority, each of the above groups established
laws to protect their authority.  The personal authorities then became
guardians and administrators of the law.  The investiture of authority
in individuals has become rather complicated in the political and
ecclesiastical fields, but in the economic field it generally goes
with the successful accumulation or inheritance of wealth.
<p>
We do not pretend that these tendencies were invented and consciously
pursued by the human species as things distinctively human.  Humans
have only refined them; they had their simple beginnings in our pre-human
ancestry.  Competition is strongly entrenched as a tendency among
the vertebrates as a whole, with the individual struggle centering
on food, habitat and mates.  Property rights among non-human animals
pertain mainly to food, abodes, territory, mates and offspring.  Such
rights are often vague and extend only so far as individual possession
and power to defend them reaches.  Seldom does the possession of trinkets
occur among the lower animals, and more seldom are such trinkets protected
with passion (occasionally, among dogs, for example).  The struggle
for authority among vertebrates is on a ``peck rights'' basis, where
individual strength, astuteness and aggressiveness are the dominant
factors.  All of these anti-social tendencies have grown out of a
struggle for food, mates and living room.  Human beings have elaborated
on these tendencies and have loaded them down with complications,
tradition and regulations.
<p>
In the socializing process known as civilization, the trend has been
to nullify the above mentioned tendencies by means of another animal
tendency, known as mutualism.  This tendency provides for cooperation
and collective endeavor as an antidote for competition.  We see it
exhibited by beavers in building a dam or in blackbirds driving off
a hawk from their nesting site.  It discounts individual possessiveness
in favor of group ``ownership.''  There is respect for the food supplies,
the dwellings, and the mates of others in the group.  Peck rights
are de-emphasized in favor of ``live and let live.''  Animal species
in which mutualism is prominent tend to dominate an area by sheer
numbers rather than by individual fierceness; for example, lemmings,
barn swallows, baboons.  The tendency of mutualism is in conflict
with the others, but they all co-exist in even the most cooperative
of vertebrate associations.
<p>
Human societies for the past several thousand years have emphasized
competition, property rights and personal authority. And they have
suppressed mutualism.  The result has been continual conflict, tension,
hardship and cruelty among humans.  Mutualism has not been practiced
with any enthusiasm since the age of savagery, except sporadically
by small groups.  Yet, in the future, it must become the dominant
tendency in our Continental society.  The other tendencies, while
they will not be completely eliminated, will be much downgraded from
their present status.  This principle must be a paramount factor in
planning for the social organization of the future on the North American
Continent.  A high-energy civilization cannot afford the frictional
waste generated by competition for wealth and authority.
<p>
In organizing the Continent as an area of social operations, Technocracy
deals in factors of mutualism rather than competitiveness.  It would
abolish property rights of individuals over public property (meaning
anything used by more than one individual).  It would greatly downgrade
authority in favor of functional capability.  Technocracy highlights
that old slogan of mutualism -- ``One for all and all for one.''
<p>
In Technocracy's design, the human effort required in operating the
Continental society shall be apportioned equally among all citizens
of the Continent on a man-hour basis, regardless of the kind of function
or degree of responsibility involved.  Since in a highly mechanized
society there will be very little time required of each individual
during their lifetime, there will be no occupational hardship imposed
upon anyone.  Nor will there be the phenomenon of personages deriving
their prestige from the number of toiling ``peasants'' under their authority.  In
general each citizen will do that function which appeals to him or
her and for which he or she is qualified.  This will be part of the
individual citizen's contract with society, and no position or function
will be rewarded with greater income.
<p>
The Health Sequence will provide complete service, with frequent examinations,
for all.  Hence, the facilities for administering to the health of
the population must be expanded, standardized and modernized.  They
must also be organized to give equivalent service to everyone --
in contrast to the class distinctions that prevail in present day
health service.  While the operation of the health Sequence shall
be on an overall basis, the attention given to each individual will
be highly personalized; for, it will be given with reference to the
lifelong medical record of that person.
<p>
In the field of education, each person shall have full and free opportunity
to advance as far and fast as his or her capabilities will permit.  Education
will be administered through a centrally-controlled Continent-wide
system, with a standardized curriculum, and with standardized presentation
and testing.  The petty politics of local school boards and the inconsistencies
and differentials of the present educational ``system'' will be eliminated;
there will be no private or parochial schools.  Further, the emphasis
will be placed on the objective factors in our society rather than
on philosophy and tradition.
<p>
The tendencies of competition, possession and authority will find
their play in avocational fields rather than in the management of
social affairs.  No doubt, there will be cults of artists, authors,
philosophers, gardeners and sports enthusiasts wherein competition
(non-commercial) shall appear, where a sort of possession can be
achieved,  albeit one which reflects individual achievement rather
than mere buying capacity; where authority among one's peers can be
gained, either through keeping ahead of others by superior accomplishment
or by climbing the ladder of a synthesized reputation.  (We anticipate
no basic change in human nature, only modifications in human behavior
arising from a change of environmental and social circumstances).
<p>
Competition for wealth and authority is far too wasteful and hazardous
to be permitted in a high-energy civilization.  In spite of its cruelties
and repressions, competition could get by in past societies; for, the
rate of dissipating the natural resources under human-toil, hand-tool
techniques was so slow that it took centuries or milleniums to devastate
an area.  But, with modern technological methods of harvesting resources,
along with the incentives of bonanza exploitation, a high energy civilization
would be short-lived. That fact is now being forced upon our attention
the hard way.
<p>
One must take into consideration the demonstrated fact, that human
beings --  at least a large portion of them -- are never satisfied
with merely having their needs supplied; they must go in for wasteful
ostentation, if their economic resources permit, as a way of enhancing
their personal prestige.  In colloquial terms, they ``go Hollywood''
or ``go Park Avenue'' at the first opportunity.  The free expression
of this tendency must be eliminated from the social design, for, the
society simply cannot afford to support such grandiose waste, especially
if a large number of people are to participate in it.
<p>
The simplest way of eliminating prestige waste, and at the same time
abolishing its corollary, poverty, is to program an efficient production
and distribution of abundance to all citizens on an equitable basis.  In
this way, everyone is amply supplied with the facilities of life and
enjoyment of living; none can acquire prestige from ostentation; and
the natural resources can be conserved for many centuries.
<p>
Technocracy proposes that this problem be handled by the simplest
and most effective of all means: It would operate the economy as a
Continental unit under the control of the Continental society.  Most
general services and facilities would be provided to all citizens
-- special goods and services would be accounted for individually
-- by means of a technological distribution system possibly similar
to today's ``smart cards'' -- as a right of citizenship.
<p>
One of the principal factors of social cost on the Continent today
is that of transportation, both of materials and people.  For the
future, this cost must be drastically reduced and must be given primary
attention in any plan for organizing the Continent.  The least costly
form of transportation is shipment by water.  To a certain extent,
coast-wise shipping can be effected by ocean-going vessels, but far
greater tonnage of freight must be moved around within the Continent
away from ocean channels.  For this purpose (and others), Technocracy
suggested in the thirties a plan for inland waterways, involving deep
water transportation to the Great Lakes via the Mississippi, Hudson
and St. Lawrence Rivers. Most bulk freight of the Continent would
be carried by water-trains over this inland system of waterways.  Large
numbers of people, particularly children on educational excursions,
could be transported in comfort on leisurely cruises about the
Continent.  However,
now, any such proposal might not be feasible because of the mismanagement
of our water resources.  Any such proposal, as with other details
of Technocracy's design, would be considered in an orchestration of
the entire Continent by the most competent functional people.  North
America must be operated in a dynamic fashion, able to take advantage
of new situations and information, with decisions made with all aspects
considered carefully by the functional personnel responsible --
each in their own sequence.
<p>
Next to waterway transportation, the least costly is railroads.  This
will be particularly so after the railroads and the railroad systems
are properly re-designed for the increased tonnage, speed, efficiency,
passenger service and other functional requirements.  Among the changes
which Technocracy has specified for railroading is a three-meter
gauge....  Because
of its high cost, air transport will be limited to those things and
passengers which require high-speed movement.  The physical cost per
ton-mile is too great for general use....  Trucks and cars would be
used much less than today for long trips.  Even now, there is a trend
toward carrying long-distance trucks ``piggy back'' on railroad cars
to reduce costs.  Few people would want to drive a car across the
Continent when they could travel that distance by fast train, then
be able to pick up a personal car at the other end for local
transportation.  Personal
cost would not be a controlling factor in prohibiting the using of
railroad services as it is today.
<p>
The roadways of the Continent would be designed into a transportation
system, with more controlled-traffic super-highways and much less
mileage of secondary and tertiary roads, such as make up our haphazard
network of roads today.  In many places the roadway mileage would
be reduced.  Yet, at the same time, far more efficient highway transportation
would be provided.  A Continental system of pipelines would serve
to transport gases, liquids and suspended solid particles over great
distances, while secondary systems would be used for local distribution
or collection.  Most power would be transported by underground high-voltage
direct current cable, with a power grid of the entire Continent, for
transportation of energy -- another of Technocracy's designs for
an efficient, low-cost operation of North America.
<p>
Another factor in the present high cost of social operations is the
inefficient methods of material packaging, handling and distribution.  Although
there is a growing trend toward automaticity. The packaging, the methods
of handling and terminal facilities could be designed for more automatic,
low-energy-cost operation, with a Continental integrated system.
<p>
In reorganization of the Continent, one of the primary problems is
that of land use.  Certain areas are suitable for agricultural crops
of one or more kinds.  Other areas are suitable only for forests and
recreation, and these include much that is now in marginal and sub-
marginal farms.  Besides the reforestation (replacing forest) and
afforestation (creating forest) of large areas, many forest and fruit
trees can be grown along the margins and in the interspaces of the
highways.  At present, these strips of land are largely wasted and
unsightly, or when an attempt is made to improve them it is with ornamental
grasses, shrubs and trees of little or no economic use, while the
upkeep is high cost.
<p>
Certain pieces of land would be flooded with lakes and ponds for water
storage, transportation, recreation, and climate modification, while
other areas would be drained or filled in, depending on the circumstances
and requirements.  The flow of some rivers would be reversed, that
of others, directed into different channels or into reservoirs.  Thus,
the precipitation falling on the Continent would be put to maximum
practical use before being allowed to flow back to the sea.  Among
other things, it is highly important that the water of the geological
formations, which has been so heavily depleted by deep wells and pumping,
be replenished -- and more added.  Most parts of the Continent
can use much more fresh water than they normally have available; yet,
they are not prepared to conserve the water which does come their
way, allowing most of it to flow off and eventually become lost in
the oceans.
<p>
In any plan for the Continental society of North America, the first
concern must be for the people who inhabit the area.  After all  it
is for the people that the organizing is done.  The reorganization
must be in reference to the people, the number and kinds, who are
here now.  What are their living requirements and consuming needs;
rather, what will they be under conditions of abundance?  What is
essential to maintaining tranquility among them?  How can their welfare
be effected with a high degree of efficiency and minimal cost?
<p>
While Technocracy is not a reform movement and is not involved in
a philosophy of ``brotherly love,'' it does provide for the elimination
of most causes of human distress, such as poverty, illness, toil,
insecurity and frustration.  Even in a new society, there will be
people with personal problems and worries, but those problems won't
be of an economic nature.  No one will want for a place in which to
live, or for clothing, or food, or transportation, or health care.  One
will be more or less burdened, however, with the problem of what to
do with one's own self -- with finding some interest or activity
to give zest to living.  We say ``more or less,'' since, for those of
little imagination or creativeness, there will be many kinds of stereotyped
activities available to absorb one's time and interest, ranging from
bridge and chess to mountain climbing or boating, and from exhibition
dancing to the reading of classical literature.  But opportunities
for ``getting ahead'' by gypping the other fellow will be nil.  One
will have to rely more than ever on personal qualities and achievements
for gaining recognition.
<p>
The problem of reorganizing North American society to conform with
the requisites of a high-energy civilization is not a political problem,
nor is it a moral problem; rather, it is technological.  It involves
a realignment of the physical factors of the environment so as to
provide the most in the way of goods and services for the longest
time at the least cost in energy, scarce materials, and human effort.
<p>
The design of Technocracy is an inevitable pattern for any area which
reaches the technological magnitudes of the North American Continent.  Other
continents, should they reach the same magnitudes, would have to consider
a similar design for their areas.  There can be no retreat into any
of the classical social forms of the past.  A new design to fit a
new and unique situation must be applied.  The design developed by
Technocracy is so appropriate, so fool-proof, so technologically
correct, and so beneficent to the population of North America that
one may wonder why it was not adopted with open enthusiasm long ago.  The
answer can be summed up in two words which apply to human behavior
characteristics: ``inertia'' and ``cussedness.''
<p>
Many people may claim mitigating circumstances for their ignorance
or misinformation regarding Technocracy; but considering what is at
stake and considering the amount of effort put forth by Technocracy
over the past several decades to inform the public -- the basic
reason is still inertia and cussedness.
<p>
Unfortunately, the advent of Technocracy depends to a large extent
upon a few thousand more people becoming sufficiently disillusioned
in their attempts to beat the Price System game to demand a change.  By
``change,'' we do not mean a shift within the patterns of the status
quo, but something fundamentally new and different.  On the Continent
of North America, a shift to socialism is not enough.  The only change
that has any meaning is a change to the technological social pattern
of Technocracy.  When that change is effected, the people of North
America can set about reorganizing their Continent for their mutual
welfare -- not a ``welfare state'' but a Technological Social Design.
