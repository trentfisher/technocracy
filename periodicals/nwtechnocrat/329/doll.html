<p>
Problems, problems -- the economy, crime, pollution, health care.  
Are there solutions within our present system?
<p>
Positively not!  Our failure to come up with lasting solutions 
stems from the mechanics of a system that thrives on problems.  
Who wants to solve problems when creating them and then Band-
Aid-ing them is so lucrative?  Why promote a healthy society or 
eliminate crime when treating symptoms and building prisons are 
multibillion-dollar industries?  Who is going to kill the golden 
goose of poverty when the welfare industry employs so many highly 
paid bureaucrats?  How can we establish peace in the Mideast when 
every arms peddler in the world is stirring the pot, creating 
markets for their wares?
<p>
Furthermore, where would our politicians be without a handy bag of 
woes to lay at the doorstep of the opposition?
<p>
That most revered of pulse-taking instruments, the gross national 
product, does not measure our well-being or the health of our 
babies, having clean air or being able to walk the streets safely 
at night.  It measures instead the dollars generated.
<p>
There is a solution available for those intelligent and patriotic 
enough to want to see a better life for all North Americans.  It 
is a program for social and economic reconstruction that would 
eliminate problems by addressing them on a technical basis, rather 
than prolonging them for profit.  Technocracy first was introduced 
in the 1930s, but the New Dealers said no deal, opting to feed the 
problem-hungry status quo by relying on war profits and such 
travesties as the Agricultural Adjustment Act, whereby people went 
hungry and wore rags while pigs were slaughtered and cotton plowed 
under to protect farm profits.
<p>
New Deal? New World Order? Same old rehash of outmoded 
methodologies.  Technocracy is the only new approach to come along 
since the Industrial Revolution, and the only one compatible with 
its potential for abundance.
<p>
So which is it North America?  More problems for more dollars or 
a solution?
