... The U.S.A. is continually boasting of its achievements, 
holding itself up as an example for all to emulate, trying to 
convince other countries to follow the governing and business 
practices that it espouses.  As an example of this much vaunted 
social system, let us look at New York city.  In July of this year 
the number of welfare recipients rose to 1,005,210, a 22% rise 
from the 823,691 receiving welfare in January 1990.  This means 
that about one in every seven New Yorkers is on welfare.  In 
dollar figures welfare now costs the city of New York, $2.25 
billion annually.
<p>
... Large corporations are down-sizing their work forces in what 
is a never-ending process.  At present the only reason the 
unemployment figures are not a lot worse is because up to now the 
service industries have taken up some of the slack.  This picture, 
however, is about to change; according to some estimates, improved 
productivity will eliminate as many as 17 million jobs.  This will 
further exacerbate an already alarming unemployment figure and add 
more people to the welfare rolls.  What answers do Bush or Clinton 
have for the part technology plays in the erosion of our social 
mechanism, and when will this problem be addressed?  Technocracy 
has been concerned about it for sixty years, it should now be 
apparent that we were correct.  How much further does our social 
structure have to decay before some recognition is given and 
action taken.
<p>
... If the above does not give you food for thought, dwell on 
this:  IBM and Toshiba Corp., together with Siemens AG of Germany, 
recently announced an alliance to develop, by late in this decade, 
computer memory chips with enormous 256-megabit storage capacity, 
16 times greater than the highest available today.  Also Advanced 
Micro Devices will team up with Fujitsu Ltd. to build a $700 
million plant to make a new kind of chip with "flash" memory, 
unlike ordinary chips, flash memories don't lose data when the 
power is shut off.  How the high-tech world is changing!  Think of 
how all of this will affect jobs, the way we operate our society 
and the time rate of doing work -- it will have more effect on the 
administration of the social mechanism than all of the prattling 
of politicians, businessmen and economists.
<p>
... Business failures, bankrupt airlines, huge corporate debts, 
banks in serious trouble, are many of the business woes we hear so 
much about.  Do our business leaders suffer?  Not according to a 
recent article in the Washington Post.  Companies checked by a New 
York management consulting firm had an average drop of profits of 
15% or more.  However, the average top pay of chief executives of 
363 large companies last year was $2.47 million, up 26% from the 
previous year.  By contrast, in 1991, the average pay of blue and 
white collar workers was $18,442, up 2.6%.
<p>
... Consider the things this article has not touched upon:  crime; 
education and health standards; pollution of our air, water and 
soil; water shortages; soil erosion; environmental breakdown; 
ozone depletion; CO<sub>2</sub> build-up; resource depletion; the population 
explosion -- and it goes on.  Solutions?  Not within the 
limitations of a Price System.  Money is an interference and is a 
limiting factor; it is not capable of dealing with the problems of 
a technological society, problems aggravated and made more serious 
by the <strong>misuse</strong> of technology, failing to make technology work for 
the benefit of mankind rather than to our detriment as is the 
case at present.  Abundance can now be produced, but it cannot be 
distributed because of the limiting factors of money.  Man-hours 
of labor is still the motivating force of the economy but is in 
rapid decline, aggravating economic woes.  The public decrys the 
sorry state of society, but at the same time diligently works to 
perpetuate the system that makes it all possible -- the PRICE 
SYSTEM.  Only when we learn to eliminate this interference and 
install a social administration based on function, will be begin 
to apply the solutions to society's problems.
