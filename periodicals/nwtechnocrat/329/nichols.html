In the past, North Americans have considered themselves quite 
adept in solving the problems they face.  They have, indeed, 
solved many of their problems, especially their personal ones.  
However their social, or collective, problems have been difficult, 
perhaps because their past conditioning has prepared them more for 
individual concerns and less for those requiring collective 
action.  Regardless of the reasons, as social problems become ever 
more complex, they seem to fall further behind in demonstrating 
the ability to solve them.
<p>
In the past, great strides were made in increasing efficiency on 
individual farms thus allowing more people to work in 
manufacturing, and then, as efficiency increased in the factories 
more people were released to work in service industries.  But now, 
many jobs depend on a large defense industry for their existence.  
The fact is, North Americans have been so successful in increasing 
efficiency that they can now produce more than they can sell for 
a price.  As a result many farm products have been plowed under, 
and planned obsolescence has been designed into many of the 
nation's manufactured goods.  This has allowed foreign competition 
to invade the North American market quite successfully with 
superior products and in the process forced an increase in the 
quality of North American products.  North Americans are now 
finding it difficult to provide jobs for the increasing 
population. Many jobs in many industries are being lost 
permanently because they are no longer needed.  Now, if everyone 
worked a 40 hour week operating this highly efficient technology, 
they would produce so much that it would flood the market and ruin 
prices.  However, if jobs are not provided, people don't have the 
purchasing power to buy what is produced and the economy 
deteriorates into a recession.
<p>
At the same time that our production has reached unprecedented 
heights, why has the debt structure risen even faster?  The 
federal debt alone is $4 trillion and is increasing at $400 
billion per year.  <strong>IF</strong> no further deficits occurred, which is 
highly improbable; <strong>IF</strong> interest payments are not considered; and <strong>IF</strong> 
this debt were paid off at a rate of $1,000 per second, it would 
require 126.8 years for it to be paid.  <strong>With the ability to 
produce so much -- with an ever declining number of man-hours of 
human labor -- this economic system of price can no longer operate 
without an increasing debt.</strong>  This debt can never be paid; it can 
only be increased along with the increase in efficiency of the 
production process.
<p>
Now, where is this famous North American ingenuity?  If the 
greatest technological mechanism the world has ever known can be 
designed and built; if the people can be trained to operate this 
mechanism; if more can be produced with fewer man-hours; then why 
can't a method of social operation be devised which doesn't 
require so many man-hours without decreasing purchasing power?  
Has the famous North American ingenuity run out of steam?  Has the 
problem become too big for North Americans to solve?  When so much 
can be produced, why should the living standards of the "middle 
class" be declining and why are millions of North Americans living 
in poverty?  And why are so many North Americans not interested in 
solving these problems?
<p>
Nowhere on earth, at any time past or present, has any society of 
people been confronted with the problem now facing the people of 
the U.S. and Canada.  They can't expect to find answers by looking 
abroad, and they can't expect to find them by looking into the 
past; similar problems didn't exist then.  Neither Europe, Asia, 
Africa, or Russia can supply the knowledge required for this 
Continent -- except that perhaps the USSR could give us a lesson 
concerning what happens to a society that fails to solve its 
major problems.  The recent riots in Los Angeles and in other 
North American cities provide more examples.  The problems of this 
Continental area are different; they are new to the human species 
and can only be solved by new techiques.
<p>
This Continent's "problem" is the ability to produce so much with 
an ever declining amount of human labor.  Instead of celebrating 
this momentous event, North Americans don't understand it; and 
therefore, deplore the lack of jobs -- meanwhile wishing they 
didn't have to work so hard.  North America has all the physical 
requirements to produce plenty for every citizen, but since we 
have no operating mechanism for the distribution of an abundance, 
this has become a big headache.
<p>
What is so complicated about the distribution of an abundance?  If 
one is hungry, and one has food, then why shouldn't one eat?  The 
ability to produce plenty should make it simple; the problem of 
production has been solved; all we need is a method for its 
distribution.  The trouble is, throughout history only a small 
amount of human needs could be supplied by human labor alone.  
Thus it was necessary to develop methods and rules, an economic 
system based on price.  This price had to be determined by the 
relative scarcity of the commodities.  All this was to determine 
who gets how much of what.  Now, with modern North American 
technology, plenty can be produced; and people have a hard time 
realizing that we no longer need the restrictions of price in the 
distribution process.  An "abundance", like the air we breath, 
can't be bought and sold for a price and for profit.  If it could, 
the need to pay farmers to produce less, and to increase the debt 
into the stratosphere, would be unnecessary.  At long last the 
citizens of North America have the ability to free themselves from 
the scarcity dictates of a Price System.  The ability to produce 
plenty means that such restrictions are no longer required, that 
the conditions in which such restrictions were useful no longer 
exist.  Why shouldn't North Americans have economic freedom?
<p>
The so-called "leaders" of this Continent have not provided the 
leadership for solving the problems of this area -- obviously 
because they don't know how.  Where in all the U.S. or Canada is 
there a public school or college with a classroom in which 
students are taught the physical requirements for the distribution 
of an abundance?  Aren't 33 1/2 million U.S. citizens living in 
poverty, riots in major cities, crime on the streets, all in the 
richest country in the world, sufficient reason to provide the 
incentive for such studies?
<p>
The people of this Continent have the greatest opportunity in the 
history of mankind to design and install a social system that 
doesn't require poverty, ill health, riots, crime and war.  Why do 
we fight against this opportunity?  This is an opportunity that 
may never be repeated anywhere on earth.  It is an opportunity far 
too great to ignore.  The physical requirements are here, that 
problem has been solved.  All that remains is to overcome the 
mental conditioning handed down from a past of grinding scarcity, 
misinformation and political nonsense.  <strong>If we can't prepare 
ourselves for the next most probable major advance in human 
history, then there is very little chance for mankind in the 
future.</strong>
<p>
Shall we attempt to continue this Price System operation by 
increasing the debt until we can't make the interest payments 
which already amount to more than $290 billion per year in the 
U.S., or about $1,900 per capita?  And this is only for the federal 
debt of some $4 trillion.  The total national debt in the U.S. 
will pass the $15 trillion mark before the end of this year.  
Where does it stop?  With increasing poverty, we may expect the 
crime rate to increase; it is already higher than in any other 
industrialized country.  We may expect more riots, wars, and a 
greater and more expensive "defense" program in an attempt to 
maintain employment and profits.  We may expect trade agreements 
with a "New World Order" to soak up North American productive 
capacity -- resulting in the deterioration of the physical 
environment.  It is no big deal to make these predictions since 
they are already occurring.  If the citizens of this Continent 
refuse to make the effort to solve these problems; if they can't 
change their antiquated mental concepts about price and scarcity, 
then there is little chance that mankind, at least on this 
Continent, can avoid chaos.  Where is that famous North American 
ingenuity now?
<p>
We must remember that social problems, like any other problems, 
can only be solved by choosing methods that work.  They can't be 
solved by "leaders" who promise to provide jobs that are no longer 
needed.  A new way of distributing purchasing power is required 
and no solution is possible without it.  It is time for all 
intelligent North Americans to investigate Technocracy's 
Technological Social Design.
