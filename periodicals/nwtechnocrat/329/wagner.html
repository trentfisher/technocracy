As Mr. Greider says:  "The American Moment cannot be about 
acquiring more wealth or weaponry or territory; the facts will not 
allow it.  It must involve a more difficult search for social 
invention, for a governance that will take the democratic idea to 
its next higher plateau in human history.  It must aim for mutual 
understanding and equitable and shared objectives.  It is our 
chance to lead the world to the high ground where no nation has 
ever been before."
<p>
Thus William Greider concludes his most timely-for-Technocrats 
book, WHO WILL TELL THE PEOPLE.  In fact, nearly everything he 
says corroborates what Technocracy has been saying for years.  
However, he stops short of saying that a solution to our problems 
has already been worked out.  That means that our task is still 
monumental.
<p>
He calls the global marketplace the "Closet Dictator," allowing 
U.S. corporations to ally themselves with any other country's 
business interests to enhance profits, declaring loyalty to the 
U.S. only for tax subsidies or for bailout by American taxpayers.
<p>
He wants the American people to continue to oppose free trade, 
saying that profits derived from poverty wages for children, from 
workers prohibited from unionizing, from factories that are 
virtual sweatshops with total disregard for the health of the 
workers, and from, unlimited environmental pollution -- such trade 
cannot truly be called "free."  He gives specific details; for 
example, the 1300 American factories across the border in Mexico, 
while exploiting Mexicans and depriving Americans of some 500,000 
jobs, have polluted the area so badly that the border is a "2000 
mile Love Canal."
<p>
The current GATT negotiations are designed to reduce business 
regulations still further; the "fast track" is to prohibit any 
possible Congressional debate.
<p>
He tells the people that the Federal Reserve has no connection 
whatever with the federal government; that it is composed of 
private bankers manipulating the money system for the benefit of 
banks and corporations.
<p>
Globalization will enhance the power of the imperial presidency.  
International elites will meet off-shore behind closed doors; 
their deals will have the force of law.  Their respective 
national governments will thus be weakened and armies, especially 
the U.S. army, will exist to prevent interference with their 
plans.  Greider warns that it is stupid, if not fatal, to continue 
the course of the last 45 years with the CIA creating 
theoretically plausible "enemies."  The Cold War and frequent 
interventions have reduced our allowable margin of error and our 
general abundance, yet government and business seem locked into a 
permanent war economy.
<p>
In this society, corporations are the leading offenders, their 
crimes so commonplace as to have lost their shock value.  Perhaps 
the worst effect of untrammeled corporate power is the feeling of 
impotence on the part of the people who alone, but working as one, 
can revitalize our society.  While the people want the U.S. to 
lead the world to higher environmental and other standards, the 
governing elites advance their own narrow interests, betraying the 
citizens.
<p>
"The world's existing manufacturing facilities, constantly being 
expanded by cheap labor and new technologies, can now turn out far 
more goods than the world's economy can afford to buy."  (Have we 
heard that before?)  This imbalance is driving all nations to the 
lowest common denominator.
<p>
We must assert a wise, purposeful nationalism even though in the 
global age this is considered reactionary.  He says the dream that 
a world institution could govern equitably across national borders 
is not feasible in our time.  The gross injustices of global 
commerce are concealed behind the high-sounding platitudes about 
"free trade."
<p>
He suggests using the military to help solve domestic problems, 
the risk of militarizing the home front being no greater than the 
dilemma we now face, the dimensions of which are so profound as to 
be yet unrecognized (or admitted).
<p>
Comment:
Greider, as do many others, closes the door on any strategy for 
influencing world events.  Technocracy, however, has long held 
that probably the only workable strategy for North Americans is to 
first unify North America and operate it with a social design such 
as Technocracy proposes.  This would provide a new model for the 
world to follow.
