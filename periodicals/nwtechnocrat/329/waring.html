<strong>The departments, bureaus, commissions, offices, councils, 
institutes, agencies, centers, services, administrations, courts, 
authorities and even corporations that constitute the hodge-podge 
framework of what is presently known as the U.S. Government</strong> is the 
result of a total absence of any sound, consistent concept, much 
less any operational plan that is compatible with our 
technological age.
<p>
Like all other political schemes, its fundamental proposition is 
how to manage people and money values in conformity with a 
prevailing economic ideology.  This is simply because politics in 
all forms, like economics, is derived from the 6000 year old 
understanding that the toil of people produces everything that is 
made.  (Adam Smith asserted this and laid the basis for today's 
corporate enterprise businesses, reiterated by Karl Marx's 
socialistic glorification of toil.)
<p>
The original 1787 Constitution, and the formal establishment of 
the Federal political government two years later, was limited by 
the vision of the merchants, lawyers, and tillers of the soil who 
led the new country's rural-agrarian economy.  All that would be 
needed, in their view, was a national army and navy to repel 
invaders, a Department of State to deal with foreign nations, a 
Justice Department, a treasury, a postal service, a small 
bureaucracy, and a weak law-making body with a president to be 
chosen in quadrennial popularity contests, otherwise officially 
known as elections, in order to give the people the illusion of 
having a voice in decisions, the one thing that was lacking in 
England.
<p>
The business leadership of the loosely "United" States fully 
intended to keep the country a confederation of almost independent 
states, except to tolerate their mercenaries in the national 
capitol.  Originally they were satisfied when the revolution ended 
in 1782 with their "Articles of Confederation" as guide.
<p>
Revolutionary in name only, the writers of the Constitution  
unblushingly copied the British parliamentary idea with a House of 
Representatives roughly parallel with the House of Commons and a 
Senate similar to the House of Lords, traditionally a mouthpiece 
for the Crown.  So wary were the financial rulers of this country 
of the people's voice that they did not allow the people to vote 
for U.S. Senators until the year 1912.  (The idea of a Senate and 
senators, of course, goes back 2,000 years to ancient Rome where 
the word originated.)
<p>
The business of Economics, long entrenched in England and the rest 
of Europe, was continued unaltered here in the Constitution except 
to make it easier, more lawfully acceptable and feasible, even if 
under cover, for the financial elite of top investment banks to 
establish policy, both foreign and domestic, for the government to 
officially carry out as national policies.
<p>
Appropriately, George Washington, one of the wealthiest land 
owners, was inaugurated first president on Wall Street in New York 
City (1789) where there is still a bronze plaque to commemorate 
the event.
<p>
At first we imported technology-- the steam-powered atmospheric 
engine whose components from England were used in 1755, having 
only 12 horse-power, to pump water out of a New Jersey mine.  By 
1800 we had about six small steam engines.  Then, beginning in the 
19th century, we began inventing technology right here -- powered 
steamboats, railroad locomotives, farm engines, water-powered and 
then steam-powered factories followed by electric-powered 
factories until now we live in the world's first completely modern 
technological society.
<p>
Today, approximately 99.9% of the work of production in mining, 
agriculture, manufacturing, communications and transportation for 
the 280,000,000 people of industrial North America is performed by 
technology.
<p>
By the year 1840 there was more steam-engine generated power here 
than in Great Britain or any other country on earth.  We had taken 
the world's lead in industrial capacity.  And today, we have more 
powered technology than there is in the rest of the world 
combined.  Our way of life is completely different from that of 
the rest of the world, yet we are deluded into accepting the 
belief that the same basic social construction, ie., politics and 
economics that rule over primitive countries whose people live 
under deplorable conditions because of lack of technology, is good 
enough for North America in the 1990s.
<p>
Our political superstructures multiplied to keep up with 
government bureaucracies and business's economic demands, both 
parasitically imposed over the production and distribution of 
physical goods and services.  A.T.&T. and the Bell System are not 
and never were in business to provide communications as all their 
advertisements claim; they are in business to make money.  U.S. 
Steel is not interested in making steel, nor is General Foods 
interested in producing foods.  Both are interested in making 
money.
<p>
Our government practices chicanery with misleading language:  The 
Department of Education does no teaching; the Department of 
Housing and Urban Development neither designs nor builds 
dwellings; the Department of Transportation moves no freight, and 
transports no passengers; the Department of Agriculture does grow 
food but only at its efficient agricultural experiment stations at 
Beltsville, Maryland and several more such USDA farms around the 
country.  Those farms are models of what could be done 
continentally on a much larger scale.  The same holds true in 
other fields, such as forestry as well as in technological 
research.
<p>
The bulk of the USDA's appropriations (money from taxpaying 
citizens) goes mainly to subsidize large commercial farms that 
grow most of the food.  Certain essential crops such as wheat, 
corn and other grains, honey, milk, butter, cheese, peanuts, etc., 
are harvested ever more abundantly as a result of scientific 
research at USDA experiment stations.  A bitter irony is that the 
first law of our obsolete Price System is to create a scarcity 
despite scientific discoveries.  The abundance our technology is 
capable of creating would drive the price down toward zero, and 
farmers, who are businessmen, would go out of business.
<p>
So, the intentional creation of scarcity has been going on since 
the 1930s.  U.S. politicians serve as agents of businessman 
farmers by collecting taxes from the citizens, then handing it 
over to the farmers via legally entitled "Price Supports", then 
keeping prices up so these same citizens can pay again in the form 
of high prices for produce.  (Part of the crops bought from the 
farmers by USDA is given freely to welfare families and needy 
school children; much more is being subsidized to be shipped 
abroad.  This is not a humanitarian gesture; it is anything to 
maintain artificial scarcity here.)
<p>
If this makes sense to anyone, consider also that portions of the 
publics' taxes allocated annually by the Treasury to USDA also pay 
the salaries of the highly competent agronomists who experiment 
with seeds and soils that will increase (never decrease) crop 
yields that will have to be taken "off the market" by Public Law 
480 whenever abundance threatens price.
<p>
Most of the departments and agencies perform mainly as regulators 
even though their names imply that they manage or coordinate for 
the public's benefit.  Actually they perform primarily to keep 
competing business interests from overstepping the legally defined 
bounds of greed, to prevent overt cheating on each other, to set 
rates, to limit monopoly, etc.  These include Interstate Commerce 
Commission (railroads, trucks, pipelines), Federal Communications 
Commission (telephone, radio, telegraph, television), Federal 
Highway Administration, Environmental Protection Agency, Maritime 
Commission, Federal Railroad Commission, Urban Mass Transportation 
Administration, Federal Energy Regulatory Administration (formerly 
the Federal Power Commission), Civil Aeronautics Administration, 
Federal Highway Administration and a number of others.
<p>
The growth and complexity of science and technology have compelled 
the Price System to institute many technical agencies that 
actually perform functionally on a national scale with varying 
degrees of efficiency, whether in research or operationally, each 
with a professional staff, and despite the arbitrary handicap of 
constrictions by Price System monetary interferences to acquiring 
needed equipment that could expand their skills and enlarge the 
scope of their services.  An example of a functional organization 
is the U.S. Telephone service before it was deregulated.
<p>
As Technocracy has long pointed out, regardless of his impressive 
sociable personality, a politician of any party or ideology, like 
a businessman or banker in North America, is a professional 
incompetent.  Those who are most adept at accumulating rectangles 
of green paper and their equivalent in other certificates of 
value, title, etc., advance in influence and authority to make 
higher-level decisions that affect production and distribution.
<p>
In other words, it is not necessary to know anything whatever 
about electrical energy to be a CEO, president or lesser official 
of an electric power utility, or to know anything at all about 
petroleum or coal to head a mining or refining company, or to know 
anything about food or nutrition to run a food manufacturing 
conglomerate, or to be able to pilot a plane to head an airline, 
or to know anything about human pathology, medicine, or health to 
be chairman of the board of a pharmaceutical company or a 
hospital.
<p>
Politicians, local or national, are not chosen by the public on 
the basis of competence or knowledge but rather in terms of 
personality and promises.  Likewise, heads of governmental 
departments are chosen not for competence, expertise or experience 
but for their personal ideology and for conformity to a particular 
"party" line and their willingness to play the game as directed.  
They do not necessarily have to know anything at all about the 
functions and services they are to direct.  The Secretary of Labor 
does not necessarily have to be one who has ever been a worker.  
The Secretary of Education does not have to have been an educator.
The person selected to head the Department of Defense , which is 
basically a functionally technical realm, is chosen without regard 
for any knowledge he may have in military strategy, logistics, 
etc., since it is now primarily a money-management agency.  The 
important thing is that they are willing to "toe the line" in 
accord with the prevailing political and financial ideology.   
<p>
Now that the concocted "Cold War" has been ostensibly suspended 
and the Department of Defense's expenditures are falling below 
$300 billion a year, the social system is unable to sustain itself 
domestically without that massive annual financial injection.  The 
economy's tottering infirmity becomes painfully obvious as it 
slides from Recession toward Depression.
<p>
Since 1945, the Department of Defense has been the main political 
support for pump-priming the U.S. Price System's disintegrating 
economy, maintaining profits and payrolls at the risk of a nuclear 
war and wantonly sacrificing 100,000 American lives in foreign 
interventions in Korea, Vietnam and the Middle East -- this with 
$4 trillion from investors injected into the Treasury and from 
Treasury bonds bought by debt buyers -- who will continue to 
accrue interest payments for as long as the system continues its 
pay-off.
<p>
As Technocracy has pointed out since the 1930s, the major national 
policies that the United States and Canada follow, both foreign 
and domestic, are and always have been decided not in Washington 
D.C. or Ottawa but privately by the top investment banking houses 
of Wall Street and Bloor Street.  An objective analysis of the 
major trends in United States and Canadian policies, especially 
since the turn of the century, will point in the direction of 
monetary investment as the dominant stimulus.  
<p>
Woodrow Wilson said in his book, THE NEW FREEDOM:
<blockquote>
"Who has been consulted when important measures of 
government...were under consideration?
<p>
"The gentlemen whose ideas have been sought [by Congress] are 
the big manufacturers, the bankers, and the heads of the 
great railroad combination.  The masters of the government of 
the United States are the combined capitalists and 
manufacturers of the United States. It's written on every 
intimate page in the records of Congress, it is written all 
through the history of conferences at the White House, that 
the suggestions of economic policy in this country have come 
from one source, not from many sources...
<p>
"You will always find that while you are politely listened 
to, the men really consulted are the men who have the biggest 
stake--the bankers, the big manufacturers, the big masters 
of commerce, the heads of the railroad corporations and of 
steamship corporations...
<p>
"Every time it has come to a critical question, these 
gentlemen have been yielded to and their demands have been 
treated as the demands that should be followed as a matter of 
course.
<p>
"The government of the United States is at present a foster 
child of the special interests.  It is not allowed to have a 
will of its own."</blockquote>
<p>
Overriding all the particulars of the Price System's internal 
pros and cons is the development of technological power in 
industrial North America.  This phenomenon was first perceived by 
the Technical Alliance, forerunner of Technocracy.
<p>
We now average 330 mechanical-electrical horse-power hours for 
every man, 330 for every woman, 330 for every child every 24 
hours, rendering politics and its controlling partner, economics, 
obsolete on this Continent.  In reality, the system's continuation 
on this Continent is becoming indefensibly dangerous:            
geologically, ecologically, technologically, socially and 
individually.  Every day that we tolerate our technology and 
natural and human resources being misused for the system's gain, 
we court serious threats to our survival.
<p>
The only alternative is Technocracy's historically unprecedented 
technological design for governance--a coordination of our North 
American productive technology and renewable, recyclable 
resources, all for one purpose:  the production and delivery of an 
optimum high standard of living to all citizens  of North America.  
It is a functionally scientific statesmanship and stewardship.  It 
means that we have no need for interference controls such as 
politics and money.  A nation-wide legal referendum can make it 
possible.  It is up to the citizens of North America.
