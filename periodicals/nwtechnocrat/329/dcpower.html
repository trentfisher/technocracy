Over fifty years ago Technocracy foresaw the advantages of direct 
current (D.C.) over alternating current (A.C.) for long distance 
electrical transmission.  At that time a design proposal for such 
a line was advanced by the organization.  Technocracy's proposal 
was ignored by the "experts".  Their requirement was profit, and 
A.C. transmission was there to exploit.  The technology for 
conversion between A.C. and D.C. did not exist, as yet, plus 
pressurized gas-filled transmission lines were unheard of.  Since 
that time these technologies have been developed to a high degree, 
and several D.C. lines are now in existence.
<p>
Members of Technocracy Inc. can take satisfaction in seeing 
industry finally becoming interested in long distance power 
transmission by direct current.  The fact that it is being done 
for profit does not diminish the result, but it should be noted 
that power transmission in the pursuit of profit is wasteful of 
time and materials.  It would be far better to operate directly 
for human benefit.  It is a sad commentary on the lack of vision 
of the leadership of the utility industry that it is unable to 
raise its sights above the petty urgencies of the moment and see 
the view of what could be if their technologies could be applied 
for the general benefit of North Americans as a whole.
<p>
With the onset of the greenhouse effect there is a great need for 
power production that does not contribute to it by producing 
carbon dioxide and other pollutants.  Therefore the need is for 
power production processes that do not rely on combustion, such as 
hydroelectricity, solar power, windpower, geothermal and so forth.
<p>
The problem is that most such power sources are far from the 
places where the power is needed.  Large geothermal power sources 
exist along the west coast of North America.  The best sites for 
windpower exist in the mid-west.  Solar power would be best used 
in the southwest desert country such as the state of New Mexico or 
Arizona.  Much hydropower could be utilized without building 
another dam.  There are some 50,000 dams in the U.S. alone that 
produce no power and conversion is a simple matter.
<p>
Hydropower has gotten a bad name of late due to the disappearance 
of anadromous fish.  This is a problem that should never have 
arisen.  A little bit of study could have allowed for fish passage 
without difficulty.  This is also a problem that is typical of 
price system planning.  There were plenty of fish at the time, but 
power was needed to make money.
<p>
It should be noted that there are many reasons for the 
disappearance of the fish other than the construction of dams, 
although dams are the most visible cause.  The spawning beds 
required by the fish for reproduction have been badly damaged by 
agricultural practice and logging.  The decimation of fish stocks 
by the high technology of fishing fleets goes mostly unmentioned.  
There are a fair number of rivers whose fish stocks have been 
virtually destroyed that have no dams at all.
<p>
A vital service provided by dams that has nothing to do with power 
production is the conservation of fresh water resources.  As the 
greenhouse effect inexorably begins to produce its devastating 
effects, and our aquifers are drawn to exhaustion, fresh water 
could become a lynch pin of civilization.
<p>
There is also a supply and demand problem.  That is, the demand 
and supply do not coincide.  The wind does not blow at the same 
time that the power is needed.  The sun does not shine at night, 
but power is still needed.  The solution to this problem is to 
have a large number of power sources on the transmission line so 
that when one or even several of them are out of action others 
pick up the load.
<p>
High voltages are needed for long distance power transmission 
because high voltage requires less current for the same amount of 
power transmitted, although, only alternating current can be 
transformed from one voltage level to another.  Alternating 
current is necessary to step up the power to the proper voltage 
level when power is output from the line to the user.  The more 
current that flows through a line the hotter it becomes, and it is 
heat that limits the amount of power that a line can carry.  
Alternating current tends to flow on the outer circumference of a 
conductor, while direct current tends to flow through the whole 
cross-section of the conductor.  Most A.C. power is transmitted in 
three-phase configuration requiring three conductors.  Direct 
current power needs only two conductors.
<p>
Technocracy Inc. proposed the interconnection of the North 
American Continent with a bipolar direct current power 
transmission grid composed of gas insulated bus (conductor) buried 
in concrete tunnel-ways that could be installed on existing right-
of-way.  Such an installation would be expensive, no matter how 
the cost is calculated, but would be well worth the cost.  Such 
lines would be much more efficient so that as more such lines 
were constructed power stations could be retired.
<p>
Such a grid would mean that only the most efficient and least 
polluting power generating units would have to be utilized.  Power 
could be sent from California to New York if necessary or 
desirable. Transmission rights-of-way would be reduced to so small 
a width as to be barely visible.
<p>
Much of the present transmission system above 230 kilovolts A.C. 
would become unnecessary.  The additional stability provided to the 
lower voltage alternating current local grids would mean increased 
reliability and result in fewer local transmission lines.  This 
would mean that thousands of acres of land could now be returned 
to other uses.  This could include the planting of trees to 
mitigate the consequences of the greenhouse effect.  In the area 
of the five states of the Pacific Northwest United States, which 
is the service area of the Bonneville Power Administration, the 
area covered by transmission lines is approximately 275,000 acres.
<p>
The ability to transmit power from any area to any other area 
would make unnecessary much standby power, which is used to 
service peak loads.  Every power utility currently operating must 
keep a certain amount of generation ready for peak loads when they 
occur.  Peak loads in cities generally occur about five o'clock in 
the evening when people come home from work.  If the load were  
spread out across the continent, the evening peak load would be 
significantly reduced.  This means that a fair percentage of 
power would not be needed because it could be transported from 
other areas not currently experiencing a peak load.
<p>
Technocracy proposed that the lines be underground, although not 
buried in the ground.  This would make them far less vulnerable to 
either natural damage or to damage by man and would result in less 
maintenance.  Direct current lines have the additional advantage 
that if either pole (positive or negative) becomes inoperable, the 
ground can be used for the return, as long as it is not done very 
often due to the corrosion it causes to buried pipelines.  This 
also means that should one area need a large amount of power for a 
short time period, both conductors could be made into one pole 
over which twice the power could be sent while using the ground 
for a return.
<p>
The power capacity (ampacity) of a gas insulated bus can be 
increased substantially over the initial design capacity by 
increasing the gas pressure, adding cooling, or both.  Therefore, 
provisions for cooling the line should be allowed for in the design 
even if cooling is not to be applied immediately.  The gas 
insulator would have to be able to be freely circulated between 
line segments, and cooling stations should be built along the 
right-of-way.  Cooling would have to be proven to be economical 
before being applied.  That is, just how much additional energy 
would be obtained, and what would be the cost of the project in 
terms of energy or dollars.

<p>
Technocracy Inc. realizes that its proposal is not a design.  
There are many questions to be answered.  The original proposal 
called for nitrogen gas as the insulator, but sulfur-hexafluoride 
is in common use today.  If a line were ruptured for some reason, 
a release of nitrogen would present no problems, but a release of 
sulfur hexafluoride quite probably would.  Sulfur hexafluoride 
must be manufactured, whereas nitrogen is simply distilled out of 
the air.
<p>
Quite probably the only really fundamental technological barrier 
to the construction of such a line would be the materials that 
comprise the insulators that center the conductor in the line 
separating the central conductor from its oppositely charged 
outer conductor.  Under stress from the constant D.C. voltage, 
charge carriers within the material tend to separate in time and 
drift through the material.  After a while the material is no 
longer a good insulator.  This is a materials problem that the 
application of research should be capable of solving.  The answer 
most certainly lies in the area of polymeric or ceramic materials.
<p>
Should the line be continuous (if possible), or should it consist 
of segments requiring interconnection?  The inerconnection between 
line segments would have to be of a careful mechanical and 
electrical design.  The line segments should be designed with 
automated manufacture and installation in mind.
<p>
Machines to be used for the installation of the line would have to 
be designed to automate the process as highly as possible.  
Machines for earth removal and disposal should be designed.  
Machines for casting the concrete trench-way in place could be 
designed.  Possibly an automated plant manufacturing prefabricated 
structures could be designed with completed parts trucked to the 
construction site.
<p>
Fiber optic cables running through the line could protect the 
mechanical integrity of the line, warning of any impending 
failures. Stations would have to be designed.  Research and 
development of solid state valves should be implemented both for 
the purpose of improving valve performance and for developing 
expertise in D.C. transmission systems. Most expertise in the area 
has now been surrendered to other nations.  The line and probably 
much of the equipment would have to undergo a design iteration 
phase before arriving at a final design.
<p>
With a cableway in place for a D.C. line, gas transmission lines 
should also be installed in them as well as communication lines.  
Eventually hydrogen could be piped to any place it was needed.  
The sole waste product of hydrogen combustion is water.  The use 
of hydrogen as a fuel has been thoroughly discussed in many other 
articles.
<p>
The D.C. option is becoming less of an option and more of a 
necessity as physical events begin to close in on North America.  
The steady decline in world oil reserves will require their more 
efficient and careful use.  Acid rain and air pollution caused by 
the burning of hydrocarbon fuels will become intolerable if not 
brought under control.  The most ominous trend of all, the 
greenhouse effect, may threaten the existence of us all by adding 
more carbon dioxide to the earth's atmosphere.  Automobiles are, 
by far, the worst offenders in every area of air pollution, 
although power production is still a serious offender, and 
reduction of that problem should be a major concern.  Consumption 
of irreplaceable natural resources when a superior technology 
exists is inexcusable.
<p>
Technocracy Inc. invites the people of North America to raise 
their eyes above the profit and loss statements of their 
individual fiefdoms and see the world that not only can be, but 
must be -- if we are to survive.  Please do not say that it's not 
your job.  If you can understand the problem, it is your 
responsibility to do what you can to contribute to its solution.  
Technocracy Inc. needs your support; North America needs your 
help.
