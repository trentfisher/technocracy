From the knowledge gained through the scientific method,

North American Continent than anywhere else, but the change is 
fast spreading over the whole earth.

<hr>
<p>
Man can, if he has good eyesight, see a speck a hundredth of an 
inch in diameter with fair distinctness.  But he cannot discern 
any detail within that speck.  However, if he should place that 
speck under a high-powered microscope -- that is, magnify it by 
some 400 diameters or more -- it then displays an amazing intricacy 
of detail.  Thus, one realizes that his ability to discern things 
is very crude when it comes to viewing the lower categories of 
size.  But rarely is an individual aware of just how crude are his 
powers of observation.  The use of some imagination may help to 
clarify this point: Suppose that this speck, a hundredth of an inch 
in diameter, were magnified to the size of a ten-foot cube, or the 
size of a small room in a house.  Then suppose you take a speck 
from this enlarged cube -- a speck which again is only a hundredth 
of an inch in diameter -- and, in turn, magnify this speck to the 
size of a ten-foot cube.  The structure of this second cube 
probably would appear to be made up of small specks, possibly 
visible to the eye.  These would be molecules or, at most, atoms.  
You would need still much higher magnification if you were to 
study the details of atoms, things like protons, neutrons, 
electrons, mesons and such.  And you would have to advance into 
still another category of magnification to see individual photons.  
In other words, if we should take a speck that appears just barely 
larger than ``nothing'' to our senses and magnify it into a cube 
more than twenty miles to the side, it still would not be enough 
magnification to reveal to the eye all the details of which that 
speck of material is composed.
<p>
When we contemplate the size of things in the other direction, we 
find that our powers of observation are again too restricted to view 
with any clarity the greater expanses of reality -- the magnitude 
of galaxies and beyond.  Only when we look at a galaxy from a 
distance of millions-of-trillions of miles does it assume any kind 
of shape.  The galaxy in which our solar system is located appears 
as a pattern of tiny light specks all around us in the sky at 
night -- too many light-specks to count, with millions of others 
so tiny that they appear only as ``fog'' --  yet, each of these 
specks is roughly equivalent to our sun in actual size and 
brilliance.  So vast is space when contemplated in terms of our 
insignificant range of observation that we cannot even imagine 
where it ``ends'' or what the ``end'' is like -- or if it has an end.
<p>
On the one hand, man is a huge, crude monster in a world of 
infinite detail -- himself a clumsy pattern of organized 
confusion, whose very outlines are so vague that they require the 
perspective of ``distance'' and grossness of vision to be clear at 
all.  On the other hand, man is so tiny, so delicate, so 
intricately organized as to seem out of place in a realm that is 
made up of whirling, swirling bodies, many thousands or even 
millions of miles in diameter and usually billions or trillions of 
miles apart.
<p>
When we turn to a contemplation of time, we are as limited in our 
perspective as when we contemplate space.  About the shortest unit 
of time that we can distinguish is a tenth of a second.  Even a 
fifth of a second, the frequency of a watch tick, appears to be 
almost nothing from the standpoint of time.  Yet, we know from 
other evidence that a second is a tremendous period of time in the 
realm of microcosmic events.  A ``billionth of a second'' seems like 
a fantastically stupid thing even to think about with our crude 
concepts.  It would take thousands of them to add up to ``no time 
at all.''  However, it is established by science that one second of 
time is equivalent to 186,300 miles of distance through space.  It 
follows, that in one second of time, there can be crowded as much 
consecutive detail as could be found in 186,300 miles of space.  
And we have already mentioned something about the detail that 
exists in only one-hundredth of an inch of space.
<p>
When we pick up a telephone and talk with someone thousands of 
miles away, we may casually wonder how the impulses that carry the 
voice can be relayed back and forth at a speed which appears to be 
instantaneous.  This wonder becomes drowned in incredulity when we 
learn that the impulse is relayed by electrons -- millions of 
relays per inch of wire -- over thousands of miles of distance.  
When we grasp this fact, if we ever do, we are somewhat prepared 
to understand a little about the speed of changes occurring within 
an atom -- such as those that nuclear physicists talk about.  There, 
within the atom, billionths of a second take on the proportions of 
``hours.''
<p>
We conceive of time in terms of some physiological ``ticking'' that 
takes place in the time-perception ``center'' of the brain.  Certain 
chemical and physical conditions tend to slow down this rate of 
``ticking'' and time seems to pass rapidly; at other times, as 
during a fever, for example, the rate of ``ticking'' is speeded up 
and time ``passes'' very slowly.  But, in terms of events in the 
microcosm, this frequency of ``ticking'' in the brain is so slow 
that the ``ticks'' would appear to be ``years'' apart.
<p>
When we invert the time scale and proceed into a contemplation of 
the ``eternities'' of the past and future, we become as lost in the 
vastness of macrocosmic time as we were in the vastness of 
macrocosmic space.  In considering the probable age of the earth, 
science speaks in terms of billions of years; and, in speaking of 
the ``evolution'' of stars, solar systems and galaxies, the periods 
of time involved become inconceivable.  Like space, the vastness 
of time passes out of our comprehension.  Where is the ``beginning'' 
and ``end'' of time?  They are not to be found within the limits of 
human concepts.  And they will remain so until some Einsteinian 
formula is devised which will define them for us.
<p>
Thus, in the wide ``spectra'' of space and time, the range of human 
experience is but a narrow line; and from this narrow line of 
experience, we try to perceive all reality.  It is so far beyond 
our grasp and comprehension that, in desperation, we tend to 
retreat into some vague emotionalism regarding the universe and 
the things in it, which, for lack of ability to define precisely, 
we term mysticism.  This mysticism is an escape from reality and 
from a stern intellectual approach to the meaning of things.  It 
is analogous to seeking an understanding of nature through the 
emotional stimulus of a musical composition.  It may ``do 
something'' to the individual but it teaches him nothing about the 
universe.
<p>
<h3>Science Advances Knowledge</h3>
<p>
Science has been accused of lacking a soul -- a feeling of 
mysticism toward the universe and the natural events around us.  
To the extent that this accusation is valid, science has been able 
to advance man's knowledge.  While individual scientists may, to a 
greater or lesser degree, experience the emotion of mysticism -- 
perhaps even be stimulated in their researches by it at times -- 
the discipline that we call science cannot be influenced by it at 
all.  To the scientist, nothing is sacred, nothing is mysterious, 
nothing is ``beyond'' science.  So, as science is applied to the 
different facets of reality, we learn more and more of that 
reality, and almost all of what we thought or felt we knew about 
it before has to be discarded.  The true scientist may be awed by 
what he learns, or bewildered by the results of his researches at 
times, or inspired by surprise findings; but he does not seek 
escapism or ``meaning'' in the ``opium den'' of mysticism.  He may 
take an interlude from the discipline of objective observation and 
``cold'' intellectualism to seek recreation -- for his ``soul'' -- in 
music or poetry; but he does not carry this mysticism back to the 
laboratory with him.
<p>
Thus the scientist is able to help in the advancement of man's 
knowledge of reality, penetrating into realms far beyond the 
limits of man's crude senses of observation and often beyond the 
limits of his former imagination.  Whether this knowledge will 
turn out to be good or bad for man, or whether it will be 
satisfying to him or not, is a matter for speculation.
<p>
In other of its branches, science has greatly expanded man's 
knowledge and appreciation of energy, in its various forms and 
magnitudes.  Energy varies in magnitude from the quanta manifested 
by movements within the atom to the cosmic forces that move 
galaxies.  Within this vast range, man is able to experience 
directly only a very small segment, measured in terms of dynes to 
thousands of kilowatts.  Indirectly, man's experience with energy 
is advancing in many directions.  The chief energy at the disposal 
of primordial man was the energy of his muscles, derived from the 
food he ate.  Now, through science and technology, we have 
proliferated the applications of energy to human use, in 
quantities, varieties and magnitudes.  These applications of 
energy are changing our whole way of life.
<p>
The branch of science dealing with the study of matter has removed 
the mystery from that field of knowledge.  It has enabled man to 
weigh quantities of mass varying from an electron to a giant star.  
It has enabled man to analyze the structure of matter down to its 
basic molecules and beyond.  We have learned how to separate 
molecules into their component atoms, how to rearrange the atoms 
to form other kinds of molecules.  The chemistry laboratories and 
chemical industries attest to man's expanding knowledge and use of 
matter in its various forms and of his ability to create new forms 
more to his liking.  Lately, man has progressed another 
fundamental step.  He has been able to break some of the atoms 
apart, to rearrange the parts, and even to construct entirely new 
kinds of atoms; and in the process he can release fantastic 
quantities of energy.
<p>
As the scientist rejects mysticism in the physical world and views 
it with clear, objective vision, he broadens our understanding of 
nature with knowledge that serves us well and on which we can 
depend.  With this knowledge man can do such things as send radio 
messages through space, make and drive automobiles, move hills and 
dam rivers; he can take pictures and turn darkness into light.
<p>
The phenomenon that appears to force a retreat into mysticism more 
than any other in the physical universe is that of life.  
Undoubtedly, life is the most puzzling of things to the casual 
observer.  There is so much that he does not understand when he 
views living things casually in their gross aspects.  The 
biologist approaches the study of life from various directions and 
views it in different perspectives relative to time and space.  
While there is much yet undiscovered about life, it is not a 
mystery to the biologist, and he does not have to escape into some 
cult of mysticism to feel at ease with it.
<p>
The protoplasm of living things is made up of the same chemical 
elements that occur in the soil, the water and the air.  Its 
activities are all accountable for in terms of energy 
transformations which are fairly well known to the physicist.  The 
structure of protoplasm is intricate and its basic details are 
extremely minute; and its organization is highly complex.  
Consequently, protoplasm is not easy to study.  But it is not 
mysterious.  Let us contemplate in their fuller perspective some 
of the principal aspects of life.
<p>
Living things have been on the earth for at least a billion years, 
probably closer to two billion years.  It is also probable that 
the earth existed in somewhat its present form for a billion or 
more years previous to that, before any kind of living matter came 
into being on it.  How the first chemical organizations took place 
which eventually gave rise to incipient protoplasm, or where or 
under what conditions, is unknown; but they did take place.  The 
key to the beginning of life must have been some chemical compound 
or mixture that could, by a series of fortuitous chemical 
changes, take elements from the environment and recombine them to 
produce more of itself.  Once this process became established, 
chemical diversification could set in, wherein the self-
reproducing material could generate complexities and variations, 
over long periods of time and in a great variety of environments.  
Eventually -- no doubt after millions of years -- this pre-living 
material evolved into the realm of complexity comparable to that 
of simple proteins.  Then, through many more millions of years, 
pre-cellular agglutinations of these proteins evolved into being 
by a tedious process of ``trial and error'' selection.
<p>
<h3>Evolution of Organic Life</h3>
<p>
When protoplasmic units comparable to modern viruses and the 
simpler bacterias had evolved, organic life was well on its way; 
and its evolution into modern life-forms was primarily a matter of 
time -- a billion and a half years, or so -- and a planetary 
environment that remained stable within the ranges of protoplasmic 
tolerance.  Organic evolution proceeded without direction or 
goals, implemented by sporadic additions of new chemical compounds 
that could be perpetuated, either by self-reproduction or as by-
products of the compounds which were self-replacing.  There was 
only one criterion for the perpetuation of any form -- ability to 
survive.  This was also the criterion for the diversification of 
forms.  The variations that could survive in either the old or 
some new environment were those ``chosen'' to continue their lines.
<p>
As mutations accumulated in the self-perpetuating chemicals of the 
protoplasm and the environment was overrun with an increasing 
variety of organisms, all of which tended to overproduce their 
numbers, the struggle for survival became more severe and more 
subtle.  Any naturalist, today, knows something of the severe 
struggle that every organism has for survival and the cruel 
competition that besets it from all sides.
<p>
The so-called cell, which has become the unit of life and 
structure in all of the larger and most of the smaller organisms, 
appears to have developed its general form some billion or more 
years ago, and it has undergone but little fundamental change 
since then.  Evolution of life over this billion or more years has 
dealt mainly with an increasing complexity and divergence of 
cellular combinations and cellular specializations.  Within this 
time, cells came to live together in accumulations, instead of 
individually; and these accumulations -- loose associations at 
first, then gradually developing into more highly organized 
``societies'' of cells -- tended to develop internal complexities, 
with different cells specializing on different functions.  
Eventually complex organizations of specialized cells became 
established as different species of multi-cellular plants and 
animals, and man is one of the more recent of these.
<p>
Looking more closely at man, one variety of the many millions of 
kinds of organisms that have diversified from the earliest organic 
forms, we learn that he is a highly complex organization of 
cellular units which are not much different in their fundamentals 
from the cellular units of corn, flies, or jellyfish.  Different 
varieties of cells are combined into specialized accumulations 
known as tissues -- nerve tissue, muscle tissue, skin, gland 
tissue, bone tissue, etc.  These tissues are arranged into organs 
-- heart, stomach, brain, hand, eye and so on.
<p>
The whole body is coordinated chemically and physically, by 
electro-chemical impulses moving along relays of nerve fibres and 
by chemicals carried in the blood.  The body and its parts behave 
in a variety of ways, depending on the circumstances and the kind 
and force of external stimuli.  This behavior is remarkably 
similar in similar individuals under similar conditions; and it 
can be predicted with a great deal of preciseness.  The functions 
of the body and their coordination are precariously balanced and 
behave ``normally'' only within a very narrow range of conditions.  
An upset in some physical or chemical factor can affect the 
coordination and behavior of the whole organism; for example, and 
intake of alcohol, of drugs, of certain foods, or electrical 
shock, a severe temperature change, or an invasion of bacteria.
<p>
Now, let us take a closer look at the cell, which is the organized 
unit of life.  The human body is made up of about a billion of 
these cells per cubic inch, each cell being about a thousandth of 
an inch in diameter.  A generalized cell would be more or less 
cubical in shape, surrounded by a thin membrane and filled with a 
semi-gelatinous material, the protoplasm.  Within the cell is a 
smaller, somewhat spherical body called the nucleus, and this 
contains a different form of protoplasm from that in the rest of 
the cell.  The nucleus also contains structures made up of denser 
material called chromatin; and this chromatin contains the complex 
self-reproducing chemicals which determine our heredity and 
development,
<p>
Should we take one of these cells, a billionth of a cubic inch in 
size, and enlarge it to the size of a ten-foot cube (we are only 
speculating now, since this act is not as yet feasible), we would 
see that it is very complex in detail -- not only in structure, but 
in activity as well.  The protoplasm would be seething and 
changing, undergoing thousands and millions of chemical changes in 
different little parts of the cell, accompanied by rapid changes 
in electrical potential between parts and areas within the cell.  
Most of the specific actions would take place in very minute 
fractions of a second of time.  Materials would enter through the 
cell membrane and these would be attacked chemically; some burned 
to produce energy and waste products; others altered into 
chemically different substances, some more complex, others less 
complex; some materials would be stored, others secreted.  If 
viewed as a whole, the cell processes would be more complicated 
and confusing than a thousand-ring circus.  Yet, it would take a 
thousand of these cells lumped together to make a speck large 
enough to be visible to the human eye.
<p>
When the body processes which supply the cells with raw materials 
for their chemical ``factories'' and carry away the waste products 
fail to perform effectively, the function of the cell is 
disturbed.  Due to lack of oxygen, glucose, water, or some other 
material, or due to an excess accumulation of carbonic acid, 
lactic acid, or some other waste product, the cell may not be able 
to carry on its basic functions; and in severe cases, it ``dies.''  
The cells die as individuals.  When enough of the cells die, the 
whole organism may cease to function, and it is said to be dead.  
Although the organism as a whole may appear dead, the individual 
die separately, and some may remain alive for days after most of 
the others are dead; particularly those of the skin which can 
obtain oxygen directly from the air and do not depend wholly on 
the blood to bring it to them.  Tissues have been isolated from 
the rest of the body and kept alive under favorable conditions for 
weeks or even years after the organism as a whole is dead, merely 
by supplying them with chemical requirements and removing the 
waste products under favorable conditions of temperature and 
moisture.
<p>
Man is a biological accident, one of the end products of more than 
a billion years of haphazard evolution.  The probability of any 
particular species being on the earth today, in terms of the 
beginnings of a billion years ago, is much less than one in a 
trillion.  Therefore, should all life be wiped off the earth and 
evolution start all over again from inorganic materials, there is 
no chance at all that a species similar to man would again evolve.  
Should only man be wiped off the earth, the chances of another 
human species evolving from the remaining life forms is zero.  
Likewise, the chances of another intelligent equivalent to that of 
man evolving from any other life form on the earth today is 
extremely remote.  Both man and his degree of intelligence are the 
kind of accidents that are likely to occur only once.  There is no 
valid reason to suppose that it could happen again, here or 
anywhere else.
<p>
Man, when he came along, had two organs which gave him an 
advantage in the struggle for survival over his competitors, 
although everything else seemed to be against him.  Man lacked 
natural weapons of offense and defense; he did not have horns, 
hoofs, sharp claws, or protective armor.  He could not run fast or 
climb well, as compared to certain other animals.  His skin was 
without sufficient hair to protect him from the cold.  However, he 
did have a complex brain and a grasping hand.  Because of these 
two advantages, man was able to survive and eventually to dominate 
the earth.
<p>
Man is a member of the Primate order, which includes the apes, 
monkeys, lemurs and others.  Man is more closely related to the 
apes in structure and function than the apes are to the monkeys.  
And he is far more closely related to a dog than the dog is to a 
lizard, or even an opossum.
<p>
Like many of the other primates, man inclines toward sociability 
and away from rugged individualism.  Sociability first developed 
among man's ancestors on the family level, later spread to loose 
associations of families, then among members of the present 
species it advanced into complex tribes and nations.  Some 
advantages of early social life were: better protection from 
enemies and the elements, more efficient food gathering, and 
specialization of functions.  One of the chief disadvantages was 
the facility of spreading contagious diseases.
<p>
The characteristic which set man off from other animals more than 
anything else was his ability to accumulate knowledge.  This was 
made effective by social living, people learning from each other 
and passing what they learned on to succeeding generations.  But, 
even so, this process took more than a million years to advance 
man's social status appreciably beyond that of certain other 
animals.
<p>
Speech and, later, writing facilitated the process of accumulating 
knowledge.  Speech evolved slowly; writing came into being even 
more slowly.  It is only within the last few thousand years that 
human beings have been able to communicate with each other 
effectively and to keep records.  And it is only within the last 
two or three hundred years that people in general have had access 
to the stores of knowledge.
<p>
With the advent of the scientific method, man learned the 
technique for discovering new knowledge.  From the knowledge 
gained through the scientific method, man has changed 
fundamentally his way of life; more so on the North American 
Continent than anywhere else, but the change is fast spreading 
over the whole earth.  Where science and its offspring, 
technology, have been at work, hardly anything remains the same.
<p>
The changes which are coming into our social lives are without 
precedent, and some of them are unrelated to anything that went 
before.  Where, for example, is to be found the ancestor of the 
automatic factory?  Or of the modern chemical plant?  These things 
are their own ancestors!  You cannot search the past and learn 
anything about the future of technology.  Nor will anything from 
the past reveal what the social order of the future, based on that 
technology, will be like.  The social order, like the technology, 
will be brand new.  One thing is certain, the new social order, 
like the automatic factory, must be carefully designed before it 
is put into operation.
<p>
The old patterns of life evolved slowly through the millennia in 
response to social needs and functions.  But, now, the social 
needs and functions are drastically changed.  Thus, the social 
organization must be fundamentally redesigned to fit the new 
social needs and functions.  Some details of the new design are 
already coming into being.  The advent of agrotechnology, for 
instance, has caused major changes in the pattern and conduct of 
our agricultural operations.  This change in agriculture is an 
advance which no one regrets and no responsible person would 
reverse if he could.  Likewise, there will be major changes in the 
patterns and operations of other social features, including 
governance, economics, education and health.
<p>
Man's view of space and time, as we have shown, is very limited; 
but through science, this view has been greatly widened.  Man's 
concept of himself and his biological history was very limited and 
crazily distorted until science corrected and broadened his 
vision. In the same way, man's concepts of society have been 
limited and fuzzy.  Society has been evolving, changing and 
growing.  It has been a haphazard trial and error process; never 
really efficient, often cruel and tyrannical.  For the first time, 
man is in a position to design his own society and plan its 
future.
<p>
Science applied to the social order, as in other fields, can 
greatly widen man's social horizon and correct his astigmatism.  
Science can clear it of the fogs and wraths of mysticism.  In so 
far as the individual is concerned, science can lengthen his life, 
make it more comfortable and less arduous, and provide him with 
the facilities and opportunities for unprecedented self-expression 
and development of personal interests.
<p>
The citizens of North America have the privilege of being the 
pioneers of this new social order based on science and technology.  
They have gone most of the way already, and there is no turning 
back.  The time for collective decision to go the rest of the way 
is at hand, and it cannot be for long evaded without serious 
consequences.
<p>
Technocracy is the name which has been applied to this next state 
in the social order.  You may well face up to it and accept it.  
You know you can't go back to anything that ever existed before.  
It is not only futile, but highly dangerous, to try dodging social 
change by skulking through the back alleys of war, political 
compromise, business finagling and superstitious ritualism.
<p>
Your place in the scheme of nature may be large or small, 
depending on how you perform during your short life.  Whether or 
not your existence will be significant to the future is a matter 
which you can decide at this crucial time.  The strata of the 
earth are full of the remains of biological dead-ends -- of 
organic forms that perished instead of advancing into the patterns 
of the future.  The byways of politics -- whether communist or 
fascist, democratic or republican -- are dead ends.  So is the 
gory trail of business enterprise.  The time for extinction of 
these social dead-ends has come; there is no place in the future 
for them.  You can stick with them and become dead-end fossils, 
too, or join with Technocracy and extend a living line into the 
future.
