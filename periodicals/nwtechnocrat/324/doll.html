<p>
For years, it was accepted that the little creature known as the 
lemming harbored some sort of unfathomable propensity for 
irrational self-destruction.  Legend held that every few years, 
vast numbers of these plump, mouselike denizens of northern climes 
would mindlessly set out on a one-way journey to Lemming's 
Leap, whence they would cast themselves from clifftops into the sea.
Recent research, however, has prompted scientists to conclude that
their periodic grand demise is due to intollerable social conditions
-- a simple matter of too littes food for too many animals in too
small an area.  Most don't even get to enjoy their short-term seaside
vacation.  They die of starvation on the way, or eaten by other animals.
<p>
Haw do we humans stack up?  Why are we, young and old alike, killing
ourselves?  In Dade County, Florida, 37 suicides were 
recorded at the secondary school level in the 1988-89 school year.  
the previous year, two children took their lives in Volusia 
County.  One was thirteen, the other eleven.
<p>
Evidence suggests that economic difficulties spur an increase in 
suicidal behavior.  This is understandable, as we are conditioned 
to view the Price System as the supplier of all our wants and 
needs. When that tenuous underpinning is pulled out from under us, 
where do we go?
<p>
But this is too easy, too simple.  The question behind this 
answer is:  Why are we so dependent on the artifice of the Price 
System that we value it more than life?
<p>
Perhaps the answer may be found in the case of the 19-year-old 
college student in Texas who recently took his life after telling 
his parents how empty he felt.  This was not a down-and-out 
misfit. This was a highly promising youth, a consistent achiever, 
a model of self-motivation.  Yet underlying it all was a sense of 
futility.  His parents would remember that, in spite of his 
achievements, he would constantly point out the stupidity of it 
all, the falseness.  In view of conditions in the world today, 
this youth, obviously, was too perceptive for his own good.  
Acquaintances shake their heads and ruefully observe that kids 
think too much these days.
<p>
Aren't kids supposed to think these days?  Or are there too many 
of the wrong things to think about?  Is the rash of suicides, as 
in the case of the lemmings, an indication that social conditions 
are becoming intolerable?
<p>
Consider the falseness in which we live and move and into which we 
thrust our children at ever earlier ages.  A lip-synching 
president with a pair of slick-dealing sons.  Elected 
representatives who would let the nation come to a halt as they 
haggle about how much the rich vote is worth.  Consider an 
economy that thrives greatly on human suffering, weakness, and 
warfare.  Perfidious religious leaders.  Highly-paid role models 
revealed as shysters and drug addicts.  Deprivation in the midst 
of plenty.  Bullet-proof clothing for school children.  An eroding 
planet.  And all this posing behind the false mask of freedom and 
a prosperity reserved for the game-players.
<p>
We live in an age of unprecedented peril.  Our technological 
capabilities are making possible a condition of universal peace 
and abundance undreamed of by any except the most starry-eyed of 
philosophers.  Yet we labor under the constant specter of 
devastating warfare and internal strife as may be seen in the grim 
reality of conflict around the globe.
<p>
In North America, unlike the environs of the unfortunate lemmings, 
our problem is not too little food for too many human animals.  
Otherwise, why would we be destroying millions of tons per year?  
The problem with food distribution, as with all the other 
necessities of life that are withheld in order to protect profit 
margins, is the very system by which we operate, the system of 
imposed scarcity and commodity valuation that Technocracy calls 
the Price System.
<p>
Herein lies the real falseness, the big lie:  the facade of 
charity and concern we maintain while, in reality, it is the 
adversarial pursuit of acquisition that holds sway over our 
actions, not a sense of service.  We are no longer what we are, or 
even what we achieve, but what we have.  This is especially 
unfortunate in that, in a land of abundant resources and the 
technology to develop them, the workings of finance actually serve 
no higher purpose than that of an artifice that separates 
humankind from its true nature as a social animal.
<p>
Technocracy has presented ample evidence that the false 
underpinnings of finance, never a reliable source of security, are 
rapidly being washed away by the inexorable tide of technological 
advance.  At the same time, those who maintain their power over 
human affairs through the manipulations of mercantile wizardry are 
doing whatever it takes to keep humankind laboring under this false 
dependence, with the tragic result that the masses who see their 
base of security -- the Price System -- being taken away from them 
are reacting accordingly.  Even more tragic are those promising 
souls with the brains to see the inescapability of the falseness 
and who choose not to participate in it.
<p>
Suicide is an extreme reaction to negative input.  Most people 
don't resort to it.  They indulge in slow suicide as they choose 
to lose themselves in drugs or alcohol, or beat up on those closest to
them.  Some beat up on those not so close.  Or shoot them.  Or cheat
them.  Or any of an infinite number of other anti-social activities
that the intolerability of our situation demands of us.  The number
and form of expressions vary as much as human individuality itself.
There is, however, but one cause -- the falseness.
<p>
The Price System has onswered this in typical and predictable fashion
with a myriad of bandaid approaches that only serve to mask the true
problem, which goes unresolved:  the Price System 
itself.  All prescribed remedies are merely designed to perpetuate 
it.
<p>
In an optimum setting, when all needs are met and all intrinsic 
expressions of individuality are given free rein, humans do not 
need to be bribed to do worthwhile things.  And deep down, we know 
it.  Ours is a society of individuals in conflict with ourselves.  
Our instincts demand that we be of service, while our monetary 
system dictates that we withhold that service in order to 
guarantee the perpetuation of the system.  This is the falsehood, 
the big lie, the Grand Separator of humanity to which even 
religion and philosophy must bow.  And it is this conflict that 
drives the socially conscious to distraction and destruction.
<p>
The lemmings die because their conditions are no longer adequate 
to support them.  Are we, supposedly the most intelligent species 
on earth, allowing our devotion to the demands of the Price System 
to head us in the same direction?  We cheat, we lie, we fight, we 
undermine the very planet that is the true source of our 
livelihood.
<p>
Technocracy's Technological Social Design provides the only 
solution to our imposed inhumanity -- a functional governance for 
the operation of the physical functions of North America, a design 
for universal abundance through balanced production and 
distribution.  With Technocracy's guarantee of equal consuming 
power for all, no one would live in fear of want, and no one would 
be called upon to be false to his neighbor or himself in order to 
secure the things necessary for a good life.  For the first time 
since before the advent of the Price System, humankind would be 
allowed to live in harmony with longings of their true nature, not 
under the dictates of a financial system that demands ever more 
and renders ever less.
<p>
Our potential is so much more than that of lemmings.  We need not 
perpetuate the intolerable conditions that take so many from us.  
The college student in Texas did not think too much; there is no 
such thing as thinking too much except in a system that demands a 
liberal supply of non-thinkers for its continuance.  Perhaps the 
truth is, far too many of us think too little.
