Among the less memorable, but more entertaining, items in the 
Technocratic archives is an article that appeared in the <cite>Wall 
Street Journal</cite> of June 3, 1948.  The article, entitled ``Remember 
the Technocrats?'' was written by W.H. Chamberlin, and proceeded 
literally to stomp on Technocracy's proposals, deriding the 
organization's concepts as a ``forgotten folly" of the Depression 
era.  An excellent rejoinder appeared in the September issue of 
the <a href="../../technocrat/index.html">The Technocrat</a>
(unfortunately now out of print), which in itself 
proceeded point by point to blast to smithereens the shortsighted 
attempts by Mr. Chamberlin to tout the American version of the 
Price System as ``the best and surest means of satisfying human 
need.''
<p>
It is obvious that Mr. Chamberlin's excoriation of Technocracy's 
principles, and his staunch defense of the Price System, were 
written from the Never-Never Land of finance whence all pecuniary 
philosophy has emanated.  As we all well know, this is a land in 
which logic and reason has no place, where high emotion and 
opinion hold sway over its day-to-day activities.  It is a world 
of humans and their whimsies.  It is not a world of physical 
science, but is instead a world over which the denizens of this 
Never-Never Land nevertheless think they exercise control through 
prudent and profitable manipulation of the gossamer strands of 
finance.
<p>
Now, forty years after Chamberlin's writing in which he champions 
the Price System, we are faced with an array of problems undreamed 
of in the post-war boom and certainly not included in Mr. 
Chamberlin's philosophy.  Unemployment is a very real part of our 
social dilemma, generated by the exact conditions that Technocracy 
has pointed out all along.  Of course our society has created 
millions of jobs -- minimum-wage burger-flippers and retail sales 
people for whom the American Dream is no closer than it was in the 
late forties.  Pollution, homelessness, taxpayers bailing out 
hundreds of savings and loans organizations, unscrupulous inside 
traders stalking the halls of Mr. Chamberlin's erstwhile stomping 
grounds -- one wonders how Mr. Chamberlin would answer these 
conditions today.  Would he write them off as mere temporary 
aberrations of our society, inevitable results of the flux of our 
economic system, as he did the Depression years of the thirties?  
Try telling that to someone living in a cardboard box on the 
outskirts of our nation's capitol or to the executive who is 
drying out in a drug rehab center because he couldn't take the 
pressures of pursuing the Dream.
<p>
To be sure, we enjoyed boom times from World War II -- at a cost 
of a mere 1,078,162 killed and maimed Americans, not to mention 
untold resources rusting away on sea bottoms or crushed into rubble 
by bombs.  Since the forty-year interim, we now see in 
retrospective investigation, that much of that prosperity was a 
direct product of war, and while our boys were crawling under 
barbed wire fences, some good old patriotic American companies 
were fattening their coffers by doing some fancy fence-crossing 
themselves -- by selling the materiel of war to both sides.
<p>
Not only has the quest for profit, which Chamberlin points out as 
the impetus for our high standard of living, resulted in a 
lowering of that standard for a growing number of North Americans, it
has taken, and is continuing to take, a devastating toll of the
physical plant we require for our existence. Of course, evidence of
this having just come to public view in the last couple of decades, it
couldn't have entered into Mr. Chamberlin's championing of the Price
System. The tragedy is, although we now have knowledge of the
evidence, most North Americans, some of them extremely concerned about
environmental and social issues, still steadfastly look for
deliverance to the very fantasy system that 
has caused the crisis -- kind of like using one cancer to combat 
another.
<p>
Technocracy's forecasts, being based on sound scientific 
principle, are as viable now as they were at the time of Mr. 
Chamberlin's pooh-poohing.  Mr. Chamberlin's observations were 
born in the intangibility of the monetary system, and a four-
decade sweep of events has negated whatever appearance of 
substance his assertions may have had in 1948.
<p>
Mr. Chamberlin wrote, ``One more fallacy might also be tossed on the
intellectual scrapheap: the idea that production should be `for use,
not for profit'. This conveys the absurd suggestion that what is
produced for profit does not get into use.''
<p>
The fact is, many things that are being built for profit -- existing
houses, automobiles sitting on car lots by the millions, vacated
factories, empty stores in strip shopping centers -- are not
being used, but are being produced with no clear intent but to feed
the economic structure. Millions of tons of resource are being
frittered away on these things, merely for the immediate, temporary
benefit of short-term employment, or on the speculation that they
might prove to be profitable, and only in that way can they be called
useful.
<p>
Chamberlin speaks of too much money in circulation. Certainly this
seems to be the case nowadays, as it was at his writing.  
They're falling all over themselves trying to give away bucks by 
the bucketfuls, but where are those bucks?  Why does the North American 
public labor under a debt structure that amounts to trillions of 
dollars if there's plenty of money to go around?  And who gets 
this money?  Lottery winners?  Winners of magazine sweepstakes?  
It doesn't take a PhD in high finance for one to realize that the 
preponderance of this money goes into the loyal hands of those who 
do nothing more than keep the wheels of finance cranking along.  
This is, of course, fitting but unfortunate that the rights of 
these individuals to consume tangible resource are elevated in 
accordance with their fealty to the non-realities of the monetary 
system.  Meanwhile, those on the productive end wind up with the 
least power to consume the fruits of their labors.
<p>
And of what good is this consolidation of wealth into the hands of 
the fortunate few to society in general, especially for those who 
are duped into shorting their families in order to divert grocery to
the purchase of lottery tickets?
<p>
Another glaring faux pas on the part of Mr. Chamberlin is his
contention that ``the dream of universal abundance'', as envisioned by
the Technocrats, has failed to materialize. Perhaps that was true
forty years ago, but, oh, look at us now! On the surface, we seem to
be enjoying the fruits of our productive capacity to a ridiculous
extent. We fill our houses with baubles, bangles and beads, and toss
them out in plastic bags or store them in land-consuming storage units
when we tire of them, blissfully unmindful of the resources in the
dumps and storage buildings.
<p>
Yet, despite all this seeming opulence, why do we find ourselves
building more jails and drug and alcohol treatment centers? Why do
elementary schools post search and seizure signs on their campuses?
Why is the security system business booming? Did Mr. Chamberlin
foresee all this? Did he foresee the massive loss of jobs of North
American companies in farming out production to foreign countries?
Hence, a product that proudly bears a label ``Made in U.S.A.'' may be
nothing more than a conglomerate of foreign-made parts, and only
assembled in America. As Mr. Chamberlin has pointed out, however, the
grand and glorious profit motive is the name of the game, and when it
comes to paying fifty cents an hour for labor as opposed to paying
one's own countrymen eight or ten dollars per hour, it's easy to see
where the loyalties have ultimately come to rest.
<p>
In response to Mr. Chamberlin's contention that, because 
Technocracy's forecasts had not materialized as of 1948 and so had 
lost validity, the editors of the TECHNOCRAT pointed out, very 
correctly, that Technocracy deals with, and has always dealt with, 
long-term trends, not the temporal nature of a Price System that 
operates solely on the whims and caprices of human opinion and 
greed.  Who can predict these elements with any degree of 
accuracy? Any economist worth his calculator will tell you that 
his forecasts are valid for only a couple
of months at most -- and on this we base our future? An economist
deals with elements that have never been overly reliable in dictating
long-term trends. Only the manner in which we employ our technologies
to control energy and resource can accomplish this end. And when
profit enters the picture, contrary to Mr. Chamberlin's assertion, it
invariably overshadows any consideration of benefit to humanity.
<p>
The operators of the Price System revert to hype to preserve their
rackets, and now a whole new generation of W.H. Chamberlins, stronger
than ever, is hovering in the wings, willing to do what they can to
prevent scientific government. Sooner or later, however, the visible
actualities must hit home. Let's only hope there is someone there to
hear the knock at the door.
<p>
Mr. Chamberlin could no more consign Technocracy to oblivion at its
tender age of fifteen than we can ignore the scientific facts that
gave rise to the organization. His article may well fall under the
category of ``forgotten folly'', but, as this article indicates,
Technocracy lives on.
