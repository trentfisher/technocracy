It is easy to be misled by all the excitement and emotion 
portrayed in the media.  But we are being cheated; we are given 
only superficial information that conceals the real events.  
Beneath the surface is a different story, and one can get a better 
understanding of events only by persisting in uncovering the facts 
hidden from view.  Let us cite an example.
<p>
One might be curious about the elimination from the histories, 
from the school textbooks and from libraries of much or any 
mention of an invasion of Russia by the U.S., England, France, 
Italy and Japan.  This was a war that went on, beginning in 1918, 
for about three years, a war which the allies lost.
<p>
The reason for the war was simply plunder!  The riches of Russia 
were probably thought to be virtually unprotected except by 
indigenous peasants who wouldn't offer much trouble.  But the 
Russians fought hard to protect their homeland and won.  Later, 
Hitler gave it another try, and he, too, lost.
<p>
But there is more to the story, and it bears on events today -- 70 
years later.  The allies, having failed at invasion, tried to 
starve the Russians into submission by setting up a belt of states 
around Russia called the Cordon Sanitaire, from which "unsettling 
influences" could be launched.  The Russians countered by setting 
up a belt of buffer states inside the Cordon Sanitaire known as 
the Cordon Rouge.  This was in the early 1920s.  World War II did 
not change the adversarial relationships except that Russia, now 
the U.S.S.R., was in a position where she could enlarge her belt 
of protective buffer states and neutralize some of those who were 
her most vicious enemies in WWII.  Antagonisms haven't dimmed 
altogether, and the U.S.S.R. is probably well aware of its 
position.
<p>
Perhaps the U.S.S.R. became convinced that the buffer state 
arrangement was more of a liability than a benefit.  Or, it may be 
possible that the U.S.S.R. realizes that peace is more of a threat 
to the West than war.  Our defense effort, so-called, has replaced 
constructive activity in North America to such an extent that it 
is difficult to visualize how immense it is.  Without war or the 
preparation for war, the West would probably be in an economic 
condition worse than the 30s.  And the leadership of the West, 
seemingly outmaneuvered in an unfamiliar game, and in order to 
save face, must try to ``seem'' interested in disarmament.
<p>
Meanwhile, technology is steadily replacing man-hours, 
undercutting the chances for people to participate in their own 
civilization.  We are becoming outsiders in our own country, 
living off the leavings while, increasingly, what is produced is 
wasted because of the Price System.  Technology could be used to 
benefit people directly, but instead, it is directed at profit.
<p>
It is in your interest to question information, to get the whole 
story.  When you do go after the facts, you will find that 
Technocracy can show you that you do have a future, and so does 
this planet.  But you and everyone else have everything to lose 
and nothing to gain in stubborn loyalty to a system that blinds 
you to your own best interest.
