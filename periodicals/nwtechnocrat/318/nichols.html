<p>
Judging from information provided by the news media across the
Continent these days, a breakdown of existing methods of decision
making is rapidly approaching.  It has been more than a half-
century since Technocracy first stated that a time would come when
the Price system would become inoperable.  This means that the
country's increasing problems would become so severe that they 
couldn't be solved by Price system methods.
<p>
So, what is happening?  Everything that is done in attempts to
solve the country's major problems costs money.  And these
problems are already beyond the Price System's ability to pay.  As
a result, the nation is now burdened with a total debt of $11
trillion.  This debt is increasing at more than $1 trillion per
year.  The Savings and Loans are in serious trouble and require a
$166 billion bailout by the taxpayers.  This is the first round of 
bailouts; the second round will be more expensive.  The banks are 
developing a case of the same disease, and when defaults of 
foreign loans get underway, they will need a larger bailout than 
the S&L's.  Obviously, the whole financial structure is 
approaching a state of crisis.
<p>
The increasing debt is proof of this crisis and proof that the 
efforts to reduce spending have been a failure.  However, it is 
fair to say that without these efforts the deficits would be 
greater than they are.  On the other hand, in order to slow the 
growth of debt, many important projects have been postponed or 
cancelled.
<p>
The infrastructure has been allowed to deteriorate until now, 
according to the NATION'S BUSINESS magazine, $1 to $3 trillion 
will be required to repair it.  With the usual cost overruns and 
profiteering, this estimate will, not doubt, be far too low.  
American educational standards haven't kept up with foreign 
competition.  Billions are needed by the educational system.  
Nuclear wastes continue to pile up with no permanent storage 
facility available and with no assurance that there will be any 
time soon.  This problem will increase with the normal use of more 
than a hundred reactors now existing in the United States, and the 
problem will expand rapidly as these reactors continue to age and 
increasing numbers require decommissioning.  Shippingport, a small 
72 megawatt plant built in the 1950s at a cost of $125 million, 
cost $98 million to decommission in the 1980s.  The cost of 
decommissioning any of the large 1,100 megawatt plants, each some 
15 times the size of Shippingport, is not known.  However the 
costs would certainly be in the billions.  A plant which cost $5 
billion to build 10 years ago would likely cost at least that much 
to decommission.
<p>
Hospitals are being overwhelmed by drug and AIDS patients who 
can't afford to pay for their treatments.  These crushing numbers 
are limiting the ability of many hospitals to care for other 
patients and may lead to the rationing of health care.  The 
financial load resulting will require increasing taxpayer 
bailouts.
<p>
Poverty and homelessness continue to increase as the incomes of the 
majority of North American families decline at the same time that 
living costs increase.  Among young families, the decline in 
income has been 26 percent since 1973.  During this same time, the 
average income for a top executive of a Fortune 500 company has 
risen from 41 to 93 times the income of the average factory 
worker.
<p>
The ongoing failure of the Price System is causing such an 
increase in crime, including crime stemming from illegal drugs, 
that the criminal justice division is already overwhelmed.  In 
some cases, the courts will require months to handle the cases 
stacked up and waiting.  Criminals must be released to allow room 
for new ones in the prisons.  Officials of crowded prisons look 
for space all over the country, and some prisoners are shipped 
2500, even 3000 miles to prisons with extra space.  And the cost 
to keep a criminal in prison is more than it would cost to send 
him to Harvard University.  (If he went to Harvard, he could study 
law, become a politician, and <cite>take</cite> our money legally.)
One must 
wonder how much crime would decrease if every North American were 
assured an income equal to the cost of keeping him in jail.
<p>
Environmental conditions are becoming dangerous.  The beaches are 
fouled with medical wastes, garbage, chemicals and sewage.  Ocean 
contamination is making fish inedible in some areas.  Pollution of 
the air is reducing the ozone layer, increasing the greenhouse 
effect, and acid rain is killing trees.
<p>
The costs of correcting any one of these major problems would be 
in the billions.  The costs of correcting all these problems would 
be staggering.  Trillions, perhaps as much as the present total 
debt, would be required.  Have you calculated the amount owed by 
each American as his part of the present $11 trillion debt?  It is 
$44,000, and the interest at 8 percent would be $3500 per year.  
The Price System is becoming unable to cope with this magnitude of 
problems -- both the debt and the physical problems, and the 
people can't cope with them by Price System methods.  Therefore, 
the Price System is even now becoming inoperable.
<p>
An organized society is necessary, and the more highly complex 
that society becomes, the more efficient its operating design must 
be.  When a highly technical society has a method of social 
operation so inefficient that millions of people can't afford a 
place to live, when 37 million in the U.S. have no health 
insurance and another 70 million are underinsured at the same time 
that health costs are skyrocketing, it is high time for major 
changes in that social operation.  This Price System is so 
inefficient, so obsolete, and provides so much incentive for crime 
that in the United States more than a million laws have been 
passed in an attempt to make the system socially tolerable.  The 
very idea of supporting such a system should be repulsive to every 
North American; it has more resemblance to a cancer than to a 
design for a technological society.
<p>
Technocrats find themselves in a unique position because they 
alone recognize the job that needs to be done.  That job can't be 
done by those who don't know how to do it.  Since no other 
organization is even attempting to provide an alternative to the 
failing Price System, Technocrats must either accept the 
responsibility or see our society go down the drain.  Those who 
have the intelligence will do something about the problem.  Those 
who haven't can't.
<p>
Only Technocrats, trained in the Technocracy Study Course and 
Technocracy's Technological Social Design know why this job must 
be done, and only seasoned Technocrats know something about the 
nature of the social operation required.  How to get from here to 
there is a big problem.  The more complex a problem becomes, the 
fewer are its possible solutions.  The transition process from the 
present Price System to a Technate includes so many variables, 
uncertainties, so many superstitions and prejudices to overcome 
that only a scientific approach makes a solution probable.  
However, it is possible that with sufficient knowledge a course of 
action can be determined as events continue to unfold and 
variables become obvious trends.
<p>
When push comes to shove, the present political and economic 
leadership could take the appropriate action at the proper time.  
That would be great, and the possibility can't be ruled out 
entirely.  Unfortunately, to-date, this source has only offered 
interference, and improvement is very unlikely.
<p>
In any case, it is doubtful that there will be any assistance from 
any source that will be as knowledgeable concerning fundamental 
social and economic operations as from the members of Technocracy.  
Technocracy has maintained its position for the past half century
and stands firm today.  It is our good fortune that Technocracy's 
founders had the foresight to place Technocracy on the firm base 
of science.
<p>
Under the dictates of the Price System, there is no unified
direction, no common goal for intelligent individuals or for
society as a whole to work toward.  Of the thousands of
organizations now existing on this Continent, only Technocracy has
made any effort to design a method which is any different or any
more efficient than the one which is now in a process of becoming
inoperable.  All other organizations support the system which has
caused the problems which they are trying to correct.  For that
reason, any activity in those organizations, except for
recreational purposes, is a waste of time.
<p>
As social conditions continue to get worse, social stability will
also deteriorate.  The number of people looking for an escape from
their Price System trap is bound to increase.  This past year has
seen a rapid increase in conditions which cause social
instability, so Technocracy can anticipate an increase in
interest.
<p>
Already some columnists are beginning to question the Price System 
and its leaders.  A Washington Post article suggests that both 
political parties are "brain dead", and that Washington, D.C., is 
"dead from the neck up."  Time magazine asks, "Is Government 
Dead?"
<p>
North American citizens who are not yet members of Technocracy may 
join in this constructive effort.  Never before has humankind found 
it necessary to make such a great change in social operations 
in such a short time.  Never before has so much depended on the 
educational efforts of such a small number of people.  And never 
before has it been so important for our own education to be 
continued.
