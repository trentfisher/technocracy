<p>
...The Federal Government of Canada has just banned the catching 
of all shellfish from a very large area off the West Coast of 
British Columbia.  This is because of contamination by Dioxins and 
Furans from the pulpwood industries of British Columbia.  This 
also follows in the wake of the recent closing of Howe Sound, a 
large body of water in the same area and for the same reasons.  
Here we have yet another example of the poisoning of our planet in 
the interests of "business first."  Long ago, intelligent action 
would have resulted in the closing of installations like pulp mills, 
until they operate in an environmentally safe manner.
<p>
...Lip service is being paid to environmental problems; meanwhile, 
the degradation continues; the pillage and rape of the planet goes 
on.
<p>
...The automotive industry extolls the virtues of its products, 
and the build-up of CO<sub>2</sub> and other noxious pollutants continues 
unabated, causing unknown problems for the future.  But economic 
considerations must have priority; the automotive industry 
accounts for 10% of the G.N.P. and some 20% of all consumer 
expenditures.
<p>
...The accumulation of garbage is a growing problem which local 
governments are taking tentative steps to alleviate.  As with all 
Price System attempts at solutions, one step forward means two 
steps back.  Incineration is becoming the solution of choice; ``out of sig
ht, out of mind'' would seem to be the rationale. It has been pointed
out that the main by-product of incineration is CO<sub>2</sub>. What
does that tell you about atmosphere warm-up? There are also other just
as insidious problems. In British Columbia, the Greater Vancouver
Regional District built an incinerator at a cost of 75 million
dollars, and by this action has succeeded in turning household trash
into a huge pile of hazardous waste. The 50,000 tons of ash produced
each year by the incinerator is so laden with lead that it had to be
declared a ``special'' waste, by environmental officials. Ash from the
bottom of the incinerator exceeds the leachable lead limits by as much
as four times while fly-ash, caught in the incinerator stacks, exceeds
the lead limit by as much as ten times. In the province of B.C., at
the present time, there is an estimated 200,000 tons of material that
is so contaminated with hazardous compounds that it needs special
storage and treatment.
<p>
...Again, lip service is paid to the problem of CFCs and its effect on
the earth's ozone shield in the stratosphere.  We are told that the
use of CFCs must be arrested and quickly. But what is occurring?
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Space Center reported that the ozone
levels over Antarctica decreased by 1.5% a day in September. And by
the third week of that month the ozone concentration had decreased by
about 30% from the beginning of the month. The rate of decrease in
ozone is almost equal to the rate of decline in 1987 when a record
ozone depletion was observed on October 5th. How big will this year's
ozone hole become? That will depend on how long the present rate of
decrease continues.
<p>
...5.4 billion tons of carbon are spewed into the air every year,
world-wide, which means something over a ton for every person on
earth.  However, it is not applied very evenly. Canadians, by their
addiction to fossil fuels, are among the world's leaders for
per-capita carbon-dioxide waste, about 15 tons each in 1986. In 1988,
nationwide, the burning of oil, natural gas and coal vomited 473 tons
of waste into the atmosphere as a by-product of combustion. That is
about two percent of the world's total. If left unchecked, emissions
are expected to rise by 49 percent by 2005.
<p>
...Waste, toxic substances and pollution all are the result of the
misuse of resources by humans who are mostly concentrated in urban
areas.  And, as the number of people increase, so will the problems
unless remedial actions are taken, and this does not appear to be
happening. The city of Sao Paulo, Brazil had a population of 2.5
million in 1955; today, estimates range from 17 million to 20
million.
<p>
It is further estimated that 2,000 buses a day, all filled with
people, pour into the city from all parts of Brazil. Some 300,000
people a year move to Sao Paulo. Similar number are moving to Rio de
Janeiro and cities like Caracas and Mexico City. Several million
people a year move to urban centers of South America, Africa and
Asia. In Karachi, Pakistan, only half of the 9 million residents were
born there. Lagos, Nigeria, with a population of 7 million, is 20
times the size it was just 30 years ago. As is usual, predictions by
politicians are proving woefully inadequate. By the year 2,000, 17 of
the world's 20 largest cities will be in the Third World; in 1980 it
was only 11. In Kenya, the city of Nairobi, is a city of children with
nearly half of its 2 million people under the age of 16.  What future
disaster does that
portend?  The Worldwatch Institute warns that this population 
explosion will stretch to the limit those cities' already 
overburdened infrastructures.  The bigger they become the more 
complex and expensive it is to service them.  Many cities in North 
America face imminent collapse.  So far, economic growth and 
infusions of money have prevented this from occurring -- but for 
how much longer?
<p>
...Nero had only Rome to be concerned with, while the ability of this
planet to sustain life, is what should be concerning us. We are
rapidly running out of time, and very definite measures must soon be
taken if the pollution of this planet is to be arrested and
reversed. We are concerning ourselves with maintaining a viable
economy, but this effort is diametrically opposite to effort directed
toward saving this
planet.  The more we attempt to maintain a "healthy" monetary 
economy, the greater will be the environmental degradation of this 
planet.  Only by abolishing all monetary considerations can we 
hope to address the very serious problems confronting this earth 
we call "home."
<p>
How this can be done is outlined in Technocracy's design for 
functional government.
<p>
Investigate it.
