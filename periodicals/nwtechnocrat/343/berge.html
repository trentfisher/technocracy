No more than glimpses of what once existed are revealed to us in the 
ever changing languages, religions, myths and legends.  But, sometimes 
the painstaking effort by scientists can give us a few facts that can 
raise the curtain of the past just a little.  For instance, the legend 
of Atlantis may have had its origin in the existence of a people who 
occupied the island of Santorini, but who then disappeared when that 
island experienced a tremendous volcanic explosion.  Current excavations 
are promising to give a basis for some of the legends about Atlantis, 
but, usually, however, legends and myths are all that remain of what 
could well have been a rudimentary level of organization. 
<P>
David Steadman, a paleontologist, and others, have been engaged in a 
systematic excavation on Easter Island intended to identify the animals 
and plants that once lived there.  As Jared Diamond writes in Discover 
magazine, Easter Island is the most isolated scrap of land on earth 
lying in the Pacific Ocean more than 2000 miles west of the nearest 
continent, South America, and 1,400 miles from even the nearest 
habitable island, Pitcairn Island.  Its mild climate at 27 degrees 
south, and its fertile soil should make it a virtual paradise.
<P>
The island derives its name from its "discovery" by the dutch explorer 
Jacob Roggeveen, on Easter, 1722.  The island that Roggeveen saw was "a 
grassland without a single tree or bush over ten feet high."  Roggeveen 
was met by a people who either swam or paddled two or three leaky canoes 
and who claimed memories of ancestors who visited an uninhabitable reef 
260 miles away, far beyond the reach of the primitive canoes that met 
Roggeveen in 1722.  The winters on Easter Island were cool and wet, but 
there was no source of firewood for the islanders to warm themselves.
<P>
Easter Island is famous for its more than 200 statues which stood lining 
the coast.  Some of the statues were as high as 33 feet and weighed up 
to 82 tons.  Additionally, more statues, 700 or more, were abandoned and 
these were as great as 65 feet tall and weighed up to 270 tons.  What 
happened to those people?  There is no answer to be gotten from the 
memories of the people remaining.
<P>
But, the hard working scientists in three fields: archaeology, pollen 
analysis and paleontology have, since 1955, continued to examine the 
historical record revealed by seeds, bones and pollen.
<P>
It is probable that a population of up to 20,000 once lived on Easter 
Island, and, in response to their chiefs or priests began to cut down 
the trees and bushes that they would need to make ropes and skid-ways to 
transport their statues the 6 miles from their quarry to the line-up on 
the coast.  Eventually, this once sea-going people had sacrificed the 
materials they would need to build the craft that could carry them to 
fishing grounds or to an escape from Easter Island.  This is reminiscent 
of our present logging practices of mindless cutting in the pursuit of 
jobs. 
<P>
The record uncovered by the scientists, gives us the story of a people 
stepping ashore about 2600 years ago on an island that could have 
provided all the materials they needed, if judicially utilized for a 
sustainable civilization.  How they dissipated what they had until they 
were left with only the option of cannibalism can be shown by the 
findings of those scientists.  The Easter Islanders lacked the 
realization that cutting down the giant palm which supplied food as well 
as wood for transporting their giant statues would make them prisoners 
on their island.  Once the boats made from these palms could no longer 
be made, the people could no longer fish off-shore, forcing them to turn 
to the bird population and rats for food.  Those rats had migrated along 
with the colonists to Easter Island and chewed the seed nuts of the 
palms, preventing them from germinating, creating a loss of future 
trees.  
<P>
Perhaps there is a parallel between those untended, lonely statues on 
the coast of Easter Island and our own so-called civilization.  Planet 
Earth is larger than Easter Island, granted, but are we more intelligent 
than those people who stepped ashore on Easter Island 2600 years ago?  
One wouldn't think so when we see what we have done to the forests, the 
oceans, the air and the very land that we must live on, and when we see 
people freezing to death on the steps of buildings whose warm interiors 
guard the artifacts of business and politics -- money and the titles to 
phantom property. Are we not heading the way of past civilizations?
