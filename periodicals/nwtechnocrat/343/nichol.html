<P>
Is the bottom line and financial success for only a few the final goal 
toward which mankind has worked throughout history?  Are Americans going 
to be satisfied with 38 million of their fellow citizens living in 
poverty and an equal number only slightly better off?  Who has assumed 
the responsibility for solving these problems?  Where are the 
newspapers, television, educational institutions and political leaders; 
where are the governments, the business and charity groups that are 
searching for the new methods required to distribute the plenty our 
technology can already produce?  Do all those people think such problems 
can be solved without a major social change?  If that were so, then why 
weren't they solved long ago, say about 1933, for example? 
<P>
In the social and economic fields our problems become ever more 
difficult as they become ever more antiquated.  The rich get richer 
while the poor have less at the same time the technological ability to 
produce doubles and doubles again.  We pay farmers to produce less while 
4 million American children are hungry.  We loan money to foreigners so 
they can buy our products and increase their population even further 
beyond the ability of their own resources to support.  We go ever 
further into debt doing things so there will be more work for our own 
people to keep industries in operation.  And we see nothing "wrong" with 
all of this? 
<P>
Environmental scientists who have, and are, devoting their lives to 
collecting information and writing articles and books concerning their 
findings about environmental conditions, are often criticized by people 
who know less than nothing about the subject.  In spite of such critics, 
the public is slowly, very slowly, accumulating a little knowledge 
concerning the only environment they can ever live in.  If the human 
species survives the debacle they are headed for, it will be because of 
the information those scientists are collecting now. 
<P>
Unfortunately, most environmentalists assume that economists and 
politicians are doing an equally efficient job of contributing to the 
knowledge that is required for providing the financial wherewithal to 
make solutions possible under present social and economic conditions.  
It is even more unfortunate that there is no knowledge that will make 
this system of price efficient enough to finance such huge projects.  
This ancient Price System can't even finance the elimination of poverty 
when we already have the technology to produce plenty for every North 
American citizen.  It certainly can't finance the rehousing of the 
Continent's people, and it is beyond possibility to build a continental 
transportation system to reduce the use of the automobile in order to 
eliminate global warming.  Instead, the focus of attention is in the 
opposite direction, finding it necessary to pay farmers to produce less 
to keep prices up, meanwhile cutting social programs to avoid bankruptcy 
and maintaining a debt structure that continues its climb skyward. 
<P>
Scientists who waste their valuable time trying to provide solutions 
that they then expect to be financed by methods that descended from the 
Barter System may as well join the crowds who use their time amusing 
themselves with trivialities.  Until those who know the most about 
environmental problems become willing to assist in the installation of 
Technocracy's Technological Social Design, their great efforts will end 
up being only an enormous exercise in futility.  The physical world 
can't be dictated to by beliefs, opinions and superstitions, not only to 
solve physical environmental problems, but to evade financial 
interference as well. 
<P>
In science, we accept facts, and only facts, as the criteria of truth; 
while in our social and economic fields, we not only tend to refuse 
facts if they disagree with our favorite beliefs, but we even ridicule 
those who attempt to present those facts.  It wasn't superstitious 
nonsense that allowed mankind to build the greatest technological 
mechanism the world has ever known -- and this from scratch in only 
about one and a half centuries.  Such a technological achievement could 
never have been possible if methods now in use in the political, 
economic and philosophic fields had been allowed to interfere to the 
extent that it presently does in the social and economic operations of 
our society.
<P>
It is so obvious that changes are necessary that only those who are 
brain-dead could believe otherwise.  What everyone DOESN'T know is 
the order of magnitude of the changes required to affect solutions for 
environmental AND economic problems.  Obviously, everyone would like to 
see those difficulties resolved -- but entirely too many would like to 
have as little disruption in their own lives as possible, and would 
prefer that someone else should accept the responsibility for doing what 
is required.  However, since such important changes will be required in 
economic methods in order to solve such problems as debt, crime and the 
distribution of purchasing power, and in order to affect necessary 
environmental changes, every citizen needs to be involved.  Even those too 
incompetent to assist in making the changes will find it necessary to 
change their life-styles for better or worse, depending on the society's 
success in finding solutions. 
<P>
Recent problems such as huge, and rapidly growing debts, poverty, 
political irrelevancy, underemployment resulting in an inadequate 
distribution of purchasing power, increasing crime both legal and 
illegal, and defects in economic theory -- are all symptoms of impending 
social changes.  Add environmental deterioration to the above and it 
becomes obvious that humans are now taking entirely too many risks to 
expect to be a permanent species without making the greatest social 
change in the shortest length of time to date.  And the above problems 
are indicators that these changes have been postponed entirely too long 
already.  Social change must be accomplished and it must continue until 
a state of dynamic equilibrium has been reached, a state in which these 
difficulties will have been resolved and a condition of social, economic 
and environmental stability has been reached.  There is no other way to 
go; but by continuing on our present route we will, inevitably, follow 
the road directly toward chaos. 
<P>
Who has the answers to these social, economic and environmental 
problems?  Certainly not those who keep calling for more economic 
growth, and certainly not those who insist on continuing the same 
methods that have previously failed to solve those problems.  Many of 
the difficulties we now face are new, society has never found it 
necessary to solve them before.  The biggest need in past history was to 
find methods to produce more of everything society needed.  That problem 
has been solved, at least for the North American Continent.  The problem 
now is to learn to use methods that can distribute the plenty we can now 
produce, and to continue producing that plenty without wasting the 
earth's resources until plenty can no longer be produced.
<P>
We must learn to produce a high quality of life, and that doesn't 
necessarily mean a high quantity.  The waste of non-replaceable 
resources in the production of inferior products to increase sales must 
be discontinued; shipping our own resources abroad to assist in 
supporting a population growth beyond the ability of those countries 
resources to support while they make no effort at controlling their own 
population must be discontinued.  We could, on the other hand, provide 
the world with an example of what can be done with what we have. 
<P>
Some population experts are now saying that a total world population of 
from 2 to 3 billion is all that can be supported on a permanent basis.  
A continuing exponential growth must inevitably lead to one person per 
square meter of arable soil, then to one person per square foot, then 
to where?  Of course it would be a physical impossibility for the earth to 
support so many, but that is exactly the direction we are now headed.  
Where does it stop?  If other continents make no serious effort to 
discontinue their population growth, what should this Continent do?  
Follow the same impossible path?  Support other nations' population 
growth until we are without the necessities of life for ourselves?  We 
must find answers to these questions or go down the drain in a most 
unpleasant fashion. 
<P>
To where is human progress taking us?  And when will a point of no 
return be passed beyond where there can be no solution possible to 
maintain the human species on this planet?  Some environmentalists have 
said that level would be reached during the 1990s.  We don't have that 
answer, but, obviously, that time will come if present trends are 
allowed to continue, and this society had better move intelligently 
before that time arrives.  We are already cutting this time pretty 
short, and if we have no "leaders" who can realize that, then we are 
"leaderless" and had better make plans accordingly.  Every North 
American who can read should study Technocracy's Technological Social 
Design; this society has no time to waste on politicians or those who 
place the bottom line first.
