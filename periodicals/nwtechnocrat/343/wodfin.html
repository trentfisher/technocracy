<P>
A 300 page book written by Paul and Anne Ehrlich and Gretchen Daily.  A 
Grosset/Putnam Book published by G.P. Putnam's Sons, New York.
<P>
This is an excellent book, presenting many details; more than should be 
necessary perhaps, concerning the problems of maintaining the food 
supply for an increasing population.  The analysis of the problems 
demonstrate a more than adequate research effort, and is written in an 
easily understandable manner, by people with unquestionable knowledge of 
the subject.  Other books written by the Ehrlichs in the past have also 
been excellent and indicate a long-time study of population trends and 
the resulting problems.  Many important statements in the book should be 
of great interest to our educational institutions, the press, and all of 
Earth's people.  Some samples follow:
<P>
"...As the twentieth century draws to a close, humanity faces the 
daunting prospect of supporting its population without inducing 
catastrophic and irreversible destruction to Earth's life support 
systems.
"...population suddenly became a taboo subject, and long-established U.S. 
policies of giving family planning assistance to developing nations 
changed dramatically.  A decade later, the public learned why: Reagan 
had entered into a secret agreement with the Vatican to do whatever he 
could to eliminate U.S. funding of international family planning 
programs and especially to eliminate any funding connected with 
abortions -- even where abortions were completely legal.
"...the growing threat to the survival and well-being of future 
generations posed by unchecked population growth was completely ignored 
by both Ronald Reagan and the Pope.
"...we and others have estimated that a global population of 1.5 to 2 
billion people might be sustainable, enabling all to attain a higher 
quality of life than that of the average American or European today with 
a less destructive impact on life-support systems.
"...It is still an open question whether man will be able to survive the 
exceedingly complex conditions he has created for himself.  If he fails 
in this task, interplanetary archaeologists of the future will classify 
our planet as one in which a very long and stable period of small-scale 
hunting and gathering was followed by an apparently instantaneous 
efflorescence of technology and society leading rapidly to extinction."
<P>
The order of magnitude of the danger indicated here is such that this 
subject should be carefully investigated, even by those who find 
themselves unable to believe that so much danger could exist.  The 
survival of the species is too important to take the chance that one's 
opinion could be incorrect. 
<P>
Unfortunately, as great as the authors' knowledge is of the dangers of 
overpopulation, together with the time required to gain that knowledge, 
it is understandable that they have not had the time required to make a 
similar and equally careful scientific study of the present economic 
system.  However, they do realize that many economic problems do exist 
which will be quite difficult to overcome in order to devise a 
sustainable future for humankind.  Some samples of statements in the 
book which indicate the economic problems follow:
<P>
"...Birth rates ordinarily fall as economic status rises; certainly 
health and well-being improve.  Yet, the U.S. is increasingly a nation 
where a relatively few rich people are getting richer and the mass of 
the population is getting poorer.
"...It is important to remember, however, [in a discussion of water 
shortages] that water will always have the tendency to flow toward money 
and power, an important social constraint on carrying capacity. 
"...Unfortunately, the pesticide industry is a powerful, well financed, 
and well organized force in the United States, backing legislation 
designed to weaken public health standards for pesticide residues in 
food.  The industry collectively contributes millions of dollars 
annually to members of Congress to promote its interests. [Note: What 
does this say about both Industry and Congress?]
"...developing nations remitted in debt service alone $1.345 trillion to 
creditor nations between 1982 and 1990.  Yet, at the start of the 1990s, 
debtor nations were collectively 61 percent deeper in debt than in 1982. 
"...External debt and other economic pressures spur government support 
of cash crop production for export at the expense of subsistence 
agriculture.
"...Today much hunger is caused by maldistribution and maldistribution 
traces primarily to a shortage of buying power among the poor. 
"...Ultimately, the plow will win its race with the stork only with 
tremendous help from the system that divides up the pie; no more seconds 
and thirds for some, while others go hungry.  The socio-economic 
inequities prevailing in agricultural systems worldwide at every level 
of organization are not only stifling production, they are also an 
important root cause of the degradation of the natural underpinnings of 
productivity.  The socio-economic constraints on further expansion of 
food supplies are at least as daunting as the biophysical constraints, 
and failure to address either kind is guaranteed to perpetuate and 
intensify human suffering.
"...Japan serves as a model of production possibilities if cost were not 
a factor.
"...A substantial further expansion of the green revolution, therefore, 
would require a complex of political and economic changes, globally and 
nationally, to make green revolution technologies available to 
subsistence farmers who still lack access to them.
"...people who live in festering third-world slums -- or are homeless in 
Chicago, Illinois, don't have their economic views expounded in FORBES 
magazine or on the editorial pages of the WALL STREET JOURNAL, which 
mindlessly view the world through rose-colored glasses as long as the 
rich are getting richer still. ...Our global civilization faces collapse 
if today's trends are permitted to continue.  The laws of nature will 
not be repealed to permit either population size or consumption per 
person to grow forever.  But people corporately plan as if those laws 
did not exist.
"...One of the trends in the world that works against improving the lot 
of poor people -- that increases inequity -- is the expanding influence 
of the already super-powerful multinational corporations.  A new global 
economic order is emerging under the influence of a few hundred of these 
giants. ...One very evident result is the failure of the new "global 
economy" to create jobs in sufficient numbers.  By 2015 it is expected 
that the number of jobless men and women in developing nations will more 
than double to nearly 1.5 billion.
"...Quoting Hans Magnus: '"More and more people are being permanently 
excluded from the economic system because it no longer pays to exploit 
them."'  The basic problem facing the new global economy will be market 
saturation.  Population growth and downward pressure on wages mean 
increasing numbers of poor people, which is not a long-term recipe for 
expansion of markets.  Sooner or later, a system driven by spreading 
frenzied consumerism is bound to grind to a halt.
"...At the most elementary level, poor people need more money to buy 
food.  Equity is needed now as never before, because humanity has not 
previously exceeded the biophysical carrying capacity of Earth. ...The 
needed actions, -- amount to nearly total transformation of human 
activities. ...We propose some key actions here quite briefly; even so, 
they dismay even us." 
<P>
The authors of this book are taking quite a chance when criticizing the 
actions of either big business or a "conservative" religious 
organization.  They may find it becomes ever more difficult to have 
their books published, advertising for the books less available, and any 
mistake made may be used to "prove" their entire work to be faulty.  
Several environmental organizations are funded by big business which 
then is able to influence, or at least partly control the information 
that is published for the public.
<P>
People who have scratched and clawed their way to the top of very 
profitable organizations are not easily persuaded to change their 
methods for the benefit of future generations.  For example, why are 
modern wars allowed to be so profitable?  Further, if those top people 
were pushed out, there are thousands more standing in line to take their 
places.  For the past few thousands of years many good people have been 
trying to make all of us be "reasonable" with our fellow man; now look 
at how far they have gotten.  As long as an economic system is allowed 
to exist that rewards legal crime (and often illegal crime) it is highly 
improbable that any widespread environmental problems will be solved -- 
unless they can be made profitable.  The only probable solution to 
environmental, as well as important economic problems then, would be the 
collapse of that economic system as a result of its own inefficiencies.  
When we look at the social turbulence now existing on this Continent it 
becomes obvious that such an economic collapse is now in progress.
<P>
The increasing debt with its increasing interest payments, crime, 
poverty and near poverty, maldistribution, homelessness and social 
dissatisfaction, all at the same time our technology is capable of 
producing plenty for all North Americans -- should make it quite clear 
that there are plenty of reasons to assume that an economic collapse is 
in process.
<P>
The first order of the day demands an unprecedented change in economic 
methods.  A change demanded first by this economic deterioration, and 
second by the demands of environmental survival.  We had better hope 
that the economic collapse comes first or there will be little of the 
earth's resources left for anyone.
<P>
Technocracy's prediction that there would be an economic collapse is yet 
to be proven correct.  However, all of the major predictions of events 
preceding and indicating the approach of that collapse, have occurred.  
Any sincere environmental effort must include the support of 
Technocracy's Technological Social Design.  Otherwise such efforts will 
be an exercise in futility.
