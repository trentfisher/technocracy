... The Cold War is over.  The U.S.S.R. is no more, and Russia in its 
present state can hardly be considered a major threat.  What enemies 
does the U.S.A. face?  The so-called terrorist nations, Iraq, Libya, 
perhaps North Korea, or some of the Latin American countries?  Why then 
is the U.S. military budget still $285 billion?  North Korea's military 
budget is $5 billion, Iraq's $3 billion, Iran's $2 billion and Libya's 
$2 billion, then throw in for Syria another $2 billion.  Quite a 
discrepancy; is this huge U.S. defense budget necessary?  Or is it still 
a good means of assisting an ailing economy, an economy that would 
surely collapse, if the defense budget were drastically cut and an 
attempt made to replace that expenditure with goods destined for the 
consumer market?
<P>
... Concern is expressed regarding climatic change -- the average 
temperature tendency for the climate of this planet to be warming.  This 
trend is the result of the increased emissions of carbon into the 
earth's atmosphere -- the biggest single source of this being the 
automobile.  In the 1950s there were 2.6 billion people on earth and 50 
million cars.  There are now about 6 billion people and 500 million 
cars.  If the business and political leaders have their way, in another 
25 years there will be a billion cars on the road.  In China today there 
are approximately 2 million passenger cars; by 2010 the projection is for 
20 million.  Thailand expects to be producing 1 million cars by the year 
2000.  Other developing nations have similar grandiose plans.  An 
average car getting 27.5 miles to the gallon emits 35 tons of carbon 
over its lifetime of 100,000 miles.  Each additional car adds that much 
to the total of carbon emissions -- if they are well maintained.  The 
emissions increase with poorly tuned vehicles.  Again we ask?  What is 
the criteria?  Is the survival of life on this planet to be sacrificed 
on the high altar of short-term monetary expediency?  Or will some 
sanity prevail and the well-being of this planet and its inhabitants 
become first priority?  For this to happen the system that depends on 
the distribution of goods and services by means of commodity valuation, 
using any form of debt token or money, will have to go and be replaced by 
a governance of function based on energy accounting.
<P>
... Stockpiled in bunkers and scattered across eight states, are 30,600 
tons of chemical weapons that the U.S. military is hoping to eventually 
destroy.  Technical problems related to this planned destruction have 
pushed back the deadline for destruction from 1994 to 2004.  The 
estimated cost of incinerating 3.3 million chemical weapons has soared 
from $1.7 billion to $12 billion.  But, the cost of this operation is 
far outweighed by the potential risks that grow as the weapons decay.  
The Army has issued precise estimates of the maximum number of deaths 
that would occur at each site in the event of an accident at any of 
these locations.  They are: Umatilla, Oregon, 3,717 tons -- 10,350 
deaths; Tooele, Utah, 13,616 tons -- 30,400 deaths; Newport, Indiana, 
1,269 tons -- 18,000 deaths; Pueblo, Colorado, 2,611 tons -- 1,600 
deaths; Pine Bluff, Arkansas, 3,850 tons -- 16,000 deaths; Edgewood, 
Maryland, 1,625 tons -- 2,000 deaths; Blue Grass, Kentucky, 523 tons -- 
1,800 deaths; Anniston, Alabama, 2,254 tons -- 11,600 deaths.  We wonder 
which has the priority?  The mounting dollar cost of disposal, or the 
risk to human life which increases the longer the destruction is 
delayed.
<P>
... More on global warming.  In the last 135 years the average surface 
temperature of the earth has risen more than 1.5 degrees F.  1995 was 
the hottest year ever recorded -- an average 59.7 degrees F.  In 
Antarctica, an iceberg the size of Rhode Island broke off and flowers 
bloomed on the ice shelves.  Seas warmed off southern California are  
decimating populations of zoo plankton that sustain fish.  Northern 
Europe had very extensive spring floods.  Eleven hurricanes, the most 
since 1933, hit the Caribbean.  More than 800 people died as a result of 
the summer heat wave in the U.S. midwest.  London had its hottest, 
driest summer in 200 years.  Northeast Brazil suffered its worst drought 
of the century; Rio has already had three times as much rain in eight 
days this January as it usually gets all month.  Siberia was a full 5 
degrees F. hotter than normal in 1995.  Alaska had very little snow this 
winter; Memphis, Tennessee had plenty.  But, we just have to keep 
producing more automobiles! 
<P>
... Technology makes jobs, or so the fairy tale goes, and so we find 
that in the following high-tech industries that they have laid off the 
following numbers since 1993: IBM, 63,000 -- AT&T, 40,000 -- Boeing, 
28,000 -- Digital Equipment, 20,000 -- Columbus Engine Co., 2,000  -- 
GTE, 17,000 --.  We wonder if those people now looking for non-existent 
jobs still think that technology creates jobs?
<P>
... So it goes on in a litany of woes that at times befuddles the mind.  
Nothing changes except for the worse, and still we cling to this archaic 
concept of money as a medium of exchange in return for person-hours of 
labour, all this when it is becoming abundantly clear that labour, from 
a human standpoint, is a declining commodity.  This is an election year 
and all kinds of promises and phony statements will be made.  Jobs, 
Jobs, Jobs, raising taxes, lowering taxes, more government, less 
government -- all the old panaceas of a bygone age.  Instead of being 
misled by all of this vapidity, ask your own questions.  Where are these 
jobs coming from?  If you raise or lower taxes what will be the real 
result?  If you manage to make a dent in the deficit, what about the 
debt?  What is to be done about global warming?  And if any meaningful 
measures are undertaken how will this effect the monetary economy?  When 
will the defense budget be cut back to a realistic level?  And, 
likewise, how will this effect the monetary economy?  What about the 
problems of soil erosion, water depletion and soil contamination -- how 
will this effect our ability to grow sufficient food?  How are we going 
to be able to feed and care for a growing population with a declining 
resource base, a decline in arable land, coupled with the aforementioned 
problems?  In short, how are we to cope with problems of an advancing 
technology?  By continuing to try to use remedies of a bygone age?  An 
age of human muscle power and scarcity?  In an age of potential 
abundance?  Again, we cannot continue to attempt to distribute goods and 
services based on commodity valuation using any form of debt token or 
money.  We need a government of function using energy accounting as a 
medium of distribution and control, nothing less will suffice.  We  
cling to this outmoded Price System at our peril.
