<P>
When one has to manufacture a certain number of words, on schedule,
every day, it is possible that not all of those words will contain
great intelligence nor purvey information worthy of the time required
to read them.  The article of October 3, by Mr. Walter
A. McDougall on ``The Death of Technocracy'' must rank
somewhere in this area.  Mr. McDougall discusses the fallacy of
``Technocracy'' while himself using the well known fallacy of
``The Straw Man.''  That is, he has ascribed to Technocracy a
concept that was never a part of Technocracy, making it possible for
him to easily disprove the idea.  If one has indeed, a valid concept,
there is no need to utilize logical fallacies.
<P>
Technocracy was never designed as a mystical shield protecting science
and technology from the correctly perceived evils of political
manipulation.  Politics, at its best, results in compromises between
competing interests that result in the best solution for all parties
including society as a whole.  This is a fairly rare occurrence.  It
seems that, in most cases, some are more equal than others.  Issues,
technical or otherwise, are warped, if necessary, to fit the
inclinations of those who might profit from a particular
interpretation.  Cynicism regarding political decision making is
widespread and, judging from results, deserved.
<P>
One error in Mr. McDougall's article is that he looks no further for
such behavior.  Is such behavior only exhibited in governmental
bodies?  Is it possible that a private corporation would make a
decision to produce a particular product based solely on profit
without considering any further consequences?  To subdivide the
question even further, is it possible that a division head in a
corporation might make a decision or shape an issue to his own
monetary benefit or that of his group?  Is it possible that, if one
looks, one might even find the same behavior in non-profit
organizations or possibly even in religious groups?
<P>
If the behavior described by Mr. McDougall is that widespread, it
would appear that something deeper is at work.  Some years back an
internal discussion about the location of the gas tank in a Ford Pinto
came to light.  Evidently, Ford executives were made aware that the
location of the gas tank was dangerous.  A calculation was made as to
the cost of lawsuits that would result from lives lost as a result and
the cost of altering the production line that would be required if the
location of the gas tank were changed.  They came to the conclusion
that the resulting lawsuits were the least expensive decision. Most
found this conversation incredibly callous.
<P>
Similar conversations have occurred in the tobacco industry.  This is
called a cost benefit analysis and is standard behavior in industry.
One, of course, can assume that when doing an analysis involving loss
of life, it is not done on the basis of those doing the calculations
losing their lives.
<P>
If a person arranges a laboratory petri dish so that conditions for
the growth of bacteria are ideal, then introduces some bacteria in the
dish, the bacteria population will expand to the edge of the dish,
then drown in their own waste.  There are two questions here.  Is that
what the human race is currently doing?  Why do they behave this way?
It is best to begin by answering the second question first.
<P>
Bacteria, as far as we know, are only aware of their immediate
environment.  That is, they do what feels good at the time.  They are
not capable of observing the effects of what they do and then
correcting their behavior to produce better results or, at least,
their ability to do so is very limited.  They are not capable of
projecting the results of their behavior into the future to predict
what the results of that might be.  If they could, they might arrange
for a better outcome.
<P>
Human beings should be able to do much better than bacteria and yet it
appears that we are unable to do so.  The commandments of operating
within a price system force us to behave with a very short term view
even when we know better.  Physically it makes no sense to pay farmers
not to produce food when people are starving.  But the financial
dictates of a price system demand a scarcity of goods lest they become
worthless to everyone except those using them.  It makes no sense to
strip the land of all its trees then destroy the topsoil so that
nothing will grow, but it is financially advantageous to do so in the
short term.  The area referred to as the fertile crescent for hundreds
of years is now mostly desert.  Human activity made it that way.  Some
years back singer Bob Dylan, in one of his songs, put it quite well
when he said ``money doesn't talk, it swears.''  The Bible's
statement that ``the love of money is the root of all evil''
seems rather apparent from simply reading the newspapers.  ``He
who dies with the most toys, wins,'' is a sad commentary on how to
live a life.
<P>
It is the function of human social organization to provide individuals
with a structure permitting them to work together for the mutual
advantage of all.  As the technical proficiency of our civilization
becomes ever more powerful and pervasive, social decisions become ever
more critical and the margin for error becomes ever smaller.  The view
of government has to be long range, protecting our future as well as
permitting enjoyment of the present.  Our current form of government
does not do very well with the future.  It, by design, is focused
almost exclusively on the present, on the transitory, often, on the
trivial.
<P>
Democracy is the mantra of every public discussion.  Few seem to
notice that a republican form of government is some distance from the
shining ideal.  There is, in the U.S., about one elected official for
every 180 voters.  Yet few seem completely content with their
government.  It might be an interesting exercise to take a
statistically significant sample to determine how many people know the
name of their state representative and senator on the state level, not
the federal.  It is probably a good bet that few people have very much
understanding of issues requiring decisions on the national level, let
alone on the state and local level.  They are easily lead by slogans
(be tough on crime!) and well financed campaigns.  People constantly
vote against their own best interests, then wonder what happened.  But
they usually come to the conclusion that getting rid of who ever is
now in office or making certain the office is elective will solve the
problem.  Occasionally an issue catches the imagination of people, but
seldom is it treated with any real depth of understanding with the
decision usually made on emotional appeal.
<P>
The prime requirement for a successful politician is political skill.
One needs to know how to ``frame'' issues to catch peoples
attention.  One needs to know how to ask for money the right way.  One
needs to be able to attract supporters.  One needs media consultants
skilled at steering the media in the proper direction. One needs to be
able to look right and to sound right.  What is actually behind the
mask matters little.  National candidates require armies of
consultants who, in turn, require lots of money. The skills required
to attain office bear no relationship to competent performance in
office.  As a rule the issues to be decided require technical
competence that takes years to obtain.  No matter who is elected,
change, if detectable, is slight.
<P>
To assist the office holder a plague of highly paid lobbyists descends
on every governmental center by the thousands.  Each has his own
tightly controlled agenda designed to convince that the rights and
privileges of his employer are paramount to others.  Issues currently
awaiting resolution include complex issues such as disposal of nuclear
wastes, telecommunications issues, and security versus freedom in
computer communications.  All these are complex arcane issues with far
reaching consequences.  Virtually none of those in charge of making
the decisions have any first hand knowledge of what is involved or the
possible ramifications of the decision they may make.
<P>
The average citizen, totally preoccupied with the urgencies of his own
existence, has little time to reflect or even try to understand the
issues, let alone decide who is right and who is wrong or which course
of action is best.  But it will be he who, eventually, will bear the
brunt of whatever course of action is chosen.  The real question, the
one seldom asked, is who decides what the issues are?  Are the issues
under discussion those that should be?  Are they the real issues
facing us or are they just a smoke screen designed to deflect citizens
from asking the right questions?  Are questions only raised when large
sums of money are involved and major corporations fear for their
profit margin?
<P>
Frequently, the most important questions require decisions that are
unpopular with just about everyone in the present, but are things that
are essential to our future existence.  At the beginning of the second
world war people gladly gave up cars, all large appliances, luxuries
of almost anything physical, they even gave up part of their food
supply.  Loosing the war could have destroyed the chance to ever enjoy
such things again.  The issues were clear, the wolf was at the door
and highly visible.
<P>
There are some mistakes that once made can not be later corrected.  It
is necessary to live with the results.  Some decisions will often be
unpopular with people who are wealthy and powerful.  The world is full
of the remains of dead civilizations.  The survivors could always move
on to a new area and start again.  That option is now gone.  One is
reminded of an old joke.  A person jumped off of a tall building.  On
one of the lower floors someone shouted a question out of a window.
How is it going?  The reply came: so far, so good.  The end result may
not be worth the path we are currently on.
<P>
In 1992, over 1,500 of the worlds leading scientists issued a warning
to humanity.  It was stated that if the human race continues the
current rate of environmental degradation and population growth, the
planet will be irretrievably damaged, condemning future generations to
vast misery.  One would think that this would certainly be a cause for
concern and a call to action on the part of the governments of the
world.  Not surprisingly it appears that profits come before survival.
It might also be instructive to know what percentage of people are
even aware of such a warning.
<P>
Those who have the most access to governmental decision making, the
wealthy, are seldom those with the most knowledge about what has to be
done.  This is the way it has been for thousands of years.  It has to
be noted that the performance of human civilization over that time
period has not been exactly stellar.  The usual response of our
government to any kind of change, is either to ignore it or try to
stop it unless there is a substantial amount of money to be made by
the ``right'' people.  Our current form of government acts at
a glacial velocity in the accomplishment of virtually any task it
attempts.  When they do act, it has usually been so convoluted by
compromise with various pressure groups that one would almost be
better off without it.
<P>
What is needed in a governmental structure is action by those most
qualified to make the decisions involving the subject of discussion.
Governmental leadership needs enough distance and insulation from
assault by pressure groups within the society, so that long term
decisions can be made and implemented for the good of the whole
society, without being shredded by pressure groups with personal
issues to defend.
<P>
What Technocracy proposed was that those with the greatest level of
understanding of social operations should be the one's running
them.  What was proposed is a functional governance, that is, a
control of the technology that makes our civilization possible by
those who understand its operation and implications.  The decision
making process would have to be unencumbered by a price system.  What
this implies is the greatest social transformation in all of human
history.  But the last 150 years have been the greatest social
transformation in all of human history.  Almost everything but our
social structure has been transformed beyond recognition.
<P>
Would such a form of social organization eliminate errors?  No.  The
operation of a social system is still a human endeavor.  Would leaders
be exempt from human foibles?  No.  Would the likelihood of bad
decisions be greatly reduced.  Yes.  Would people have access to their
leadership? Yes.  Would the society as a whole have input into the
direction the society is to take?  Yes.
<P>
A legitimate question arises about the willingness of U.S. citizens to
accept a government peopled by experts in their respective fields.  As
it is now, Americans are barely able to stomach a government that they
themselves elect.  The answer to this question is, again, yes, if
certain conditions are met.  They would have to be certain that the
selection of people for those positions is solely on the basis of
competence and no other basis.  They would have to know that their
voices could be heard without fear of retribution and would be
listened to as long as a carefully reasoned argument for their
position were presented.  If people were convinced that decisions were
made on the basis of the best interests of the society as a whole and
not on the basis of personal prejudice.  If people knew that they
could have input into the decision making process at any time and into
the general direction the whole society is moving.
<P>
Mr. McDougall might be somewhat surprised if, upon boarding an
airliner, passengers were told they would have to select a pilot from
among their number by common agreement.  It is most likely that no one
thinks very much about the pilot as long as he does his job and takes
the passengers where they were planning on going without incident.
One always hopes for an uneventful flight.  Most people don't care
anything about the pilot as long as he does his job.  They don't
care anything about his religion, his politics, his color, his moral
quality, his appearance, or his or her gender.  The real question is,
if such a thing were to occur, ``how many people would choose to
remain on the aircraft?''
<P>
Social systems develop a natural selection particular to their design.
The ancient Roman Empire produced military leaders because they were
just about the only ones capable of rising to the top of such a
structure, a few became leaders by inheritance, but not very many, and
most were not outstanding.  Desperate circumstances produce desperate
leaders.  The social turmoil in Germany produced Hitler, in Russia,
Lenin, in France, Napoleon, and in Cambodia, Pol Pot.  When leadership
is left to inheritance it is usually degraded to a low level in a few
generations.
<P>
Our system produces clever, well connected politicians.  Our social
system is based on science and technology.  Few of our citizens
understand much about either, nor does our leadership.  One recent
U.S. president even used astrology in decision making.  The methods of
science, perfected slowly over several hundred years, are the best
methods humanity has ever developed for analyzing anything.  It is
time to incorporate this into our social system.  In the social system
proposed by Technocracy, leadership would naturally rise to the top.
<P>
Every civilization on Earth has destroyed itself.  But the impact of
that destruction was small compared to the size of the Earth.  The
resources required to build a new civilization could always be found
somewhere else.  Our civilization covers the Earth and the impact is
enormous.  Not only are we degrading irreplaceable natural resources
at an alarming rate, devastating the area where they are found, but we
are converting replaceable resources into irreplaceable by our
destructive methods of consumption.  Just how much time the current
civilization has before it self destructs is not known.  This is a
problem that humanity must solve or the future will belong to other
species.  It is a problem that no other civilization in history has
solved.  It has been left to us.
