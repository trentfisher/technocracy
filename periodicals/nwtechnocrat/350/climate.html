<hr>
<P>
The long promised greenhouse effect has finally arrived.  Combustion
of hydrocarbon materials to produce energy has resulted in an increase
in the level of carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere.  This causes
more heat from solar radiation to be trapped in the atmosphere that
would otherwise be radiated into space.  The increasing temperature of
the atmosphere will cause a change in climate and weather conditions
across the Earth.  Virtually all atmospheric scientists on the Earth
agree that the effects will be bad for humanity.
<P>
The effects of greenhouse warming are just now beginning to become
observable to people in general.  But, even if we take measures now to
reverse the effect, it will take many decades before those effects
would begin to be felt.  The September/October issue of the
<cite>Sierra</cite>,
the magazine of the Sierra Club, reported that atmospheric carbon
dioxide in the atmosphere increase from 280 parts per million (PPM) in
pre-industrial times to 360 PPM today.  The Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC) has estimated that, if we continue on our
current course, this will rise to somewhere between 480 to 800 PPM by
the end of the next century.
<P>
Well, so what?  We might have to wear our sunglasses more often and
increase our collection of T-shirts.  This seems to be a common
attitude among those with little understanding of the consequences.
Just what are the consequences?
<h3>HEAT</h3>
<P>
Reported in same issue of Sierra as above was the fact that although
there were some viscous winter storms, the period between 1991 and
1995 were the warmest years on record.  Human activity has increased
the Earth's temperature by one degree in this century and more is
scheduled in the future.  These temperature changes will not be
equally distributed.  A recent news report stated that since the
1930's the Antarctic ice sheet has probably decreased by as much as
one fourth of it's original mass.  The oceans are rising,
threatening all areas bordering them.  Another effect is that as the
temperature of the oceans increase the volume occupied by the water
also increases.  Summer heat waves in 1995 killed so many people in
Chicago that the city morgue overflowed with bodies.
<h3>DISEASE</h3>
<P>
As temperature increases, diseases regarded as tropical begin to move
north.  Sierra reports that a study by the Journal of the American
Medical Association states that deaths from malaria could increase by
a million worldwide, a two-thirds increase.  The same could be
expected of other diseases.  Another impact could also be that the
rate of mutation could also increase due to higher temperatures which
could mean that diseases could much more quickly become immune to the
medicines designed to cure them.
<h3>VANISHING HABITAT</h3>
<P>
Species have adapted to the current environment over thousands if not
millions of years.  The time scale over which global warming is
occurring is a geological instant.  There simply is not enough time
for many species to adapt. Both plants and animals will die.  Species
that produce many offspring over a short life span will probably
survive the best.  This includes most insects, bacteria, and viruses.
Probably most freshwater fish will be lost as well as many birds.
Vermont will probably no longer have any sugar maple trees.
<h3>EXTREME WEATHER</h3>
<P>
Sierra magazine reported a conversation between Vice President Al Gore
and a mayor of a town in North Dakota who recalled having six
hundred-year floods in the last ten years.  Stronger and more numerous
hurricanes appear likely and now may begin occurring in the Pacific
with greater frequency. The simple fact that a warmer atmosphere
contains more energy will most likely produce more violent weather.  A
study by the Japanese government predicts a 60% increase in Atlantic
hurricanes.
<h3>THE RESPONSE</h3>
<P>
Many of the worlds governments will shortly be meeting in Kyoto, Japan
to discuss measures to prevent or at least reduce global warming.
This appears unlikely to result in anything substantive.  At this
point all nations look to the United States for leadership in the
matter since it is they who produce the largest amount.  The U.S. has
said that it wants to do something about the situation as long as it
doesn't disturb the economy.  Australia doesn't want anything to
disrupt its export market for coal.  China is expanding its economy at
the expense of large environmental degradation and doesn't want
that to stop.  Japan says that it already is an environmental leader
and should not have to increase its commitment when countries, such as
the U.S., are doing so little.  Poorer countries say it's the rich
countries that are doing most of the polluting.
<P>
Meanwhile nuclear power corporations are drooling at the prospect.
Their assumption is that the only way to reduce carbon dioxide
emissions is to increase power production using nuclear power and that
means money for them.  The U.S. recently dropped its ban on the sale
of nuclear reactors to China.  The nuclear power industry had been
lobbying Washington very heavily.
<P>
At the 15<SUP>th</SUP> World Petroleum Congress Exxon CEO Lee Raymond
said that the earth's temperature is not getting warmer and that if
it were, it wouldn't be the fault of oil and natural gas.  In the
face of the evidence, this is a truly amazing statement.  This sounds
somewhat similar to the protestations of an alcoholic that he can quit
anytime he wants and, in any case, he's not doing any harm.  The
30% increase in carbon dioxide since the inception of the industrial
age is ascribable to nothing else.
<P>
This is also a remarkable display of ignorance of basic combustion
chemistry of any hydrocarbon.  It is not possible to burn any
hydrocarbon without producing carbon dioxide.  Incomplete combustion
will also produce other by products but carbon dioxide would be the
only waste produce if combustion were perfect.  Any energy conversion
process that uses a hydrocarbon fuel will produce carbon dioxide as a
waste product.
<P>
A few weeks ago the CEO of British Petroleum admitted that global
warming is a serious problem.  Why the difference between the two
corporate heads?  BP has investments in solar power.  Even though the
remark is self serving it is still moving in the direction of a
solution and is therefore helpful.
<h3>A TECHNOCRATIC PERSPECTIVE</h3>
<P>
Few issues have so clearly shown the deficiencies and defects of a
price system in societal decision making.  The nations of the world
are defending their financial turf like junk yard dogs.  They are
pointing fingers at each other like grade school children.  This has
to be the modern version of fiddling while Rome burns.
<P>
Over sixty years ago Technocracy proposed the construction of a
continent wide electric power grid.  At that time all the equipment
would have had to have been designed.  Now most of the required
equipment is virtually off the shelf, although test lines would have
to be constructed and tested.  Most of the benign alternative power is
obtainable in places that lack a use for it.  Such a grid would permit
the rapid efficient transportation of the power to where it is needed
thereby displacing fossil fuel fired plants.
<P>
The development of alternative power has been hampered by a lack of
research and development funds.  Research and development funds go to
those with the loudest political voices.  In other words, those with
the most money.  Any new technology, no matter how promising, requires
a constituency, support of the rich and powerful, or nothing happens.
Why?  There are those who feel they would gain a direct competitor if
the new technology were developed.  There are those who feel that they
would, at least, not gain anything from its development.
<P>
Many environmental organizations support the development of some of
these technologies.  This represents a constituency.  Why are these
technologies so under funded?  The answer is that those constituencies
do not contribute enough to political campaigns to determine the
outcome of who is in office and who is not.  Again, the criteria for
determining what is to be done by the society is decided by factors
that have nothing to do with the actual question.  Should these
technologies be developed?  Would society, as a whole, benefit?  What
would the consequences of not developing the technology in question
be?  It is also important to note that those making the decisions have
little understanding of the issues.  They must depend on the knowledge
of others who do.  Those others may very well have political or
financial agendas of their own.
<P>
Some of those in the energy business have stated that to do something
about the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would
require a drastic reduction in the standard of living.  This is simply
untrue.  The U.S. has a very low energy efficiency.  There is much
room for dramatic improvement.  None of this would require severe
sacrifices.  Again, those with selfish agendas are promoting a
campaign to benefit themselves.
<P>
The real error made by those who understand the seriousness of the
situation and want to do something about it is to blame those who fear
doing anything.  Most such organizations move to pass some new law
that they feel will correct the ills.  Many feel that by supporting
the right candidate the problem will be solved.  The sooner they
realize that piling band-aid on top of band-aid will not solve the
problem, the sooner they will realize what is really needed.
<P>
The real problem is the strange, warped social structure created by
living in a price system.  This system establishes a social
environment in which proper decision making is less and less likely.
As time goes by and technology becomes the ever more ubiquitous,
decisions become ever more critical and the consequences of bad
decisions ever more devastating.  People should realize that the
burden of bad decisions will seldom be born by those making them.  The
average citizen will pay the price and it will be a heavy one.  The
longer the price system continues the more precarious becomes the
human situation.
<P>
Technocracy understood this six decades ago.  It is still the only
social system designed to operate our high energy civilization for the
benefit of all it's citizens.
