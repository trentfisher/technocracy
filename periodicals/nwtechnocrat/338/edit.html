<P>
Technocracy Inc. was conceived and designed to do a job that once 
concluded would signal it to self-destruct -- it was not intended to be 
preserved into the future. It is intended to be an educational 
organization, non-profit, non-sectarian and, especially, non-political.  
<P>
Many people, over the years, have sought to grab bits of Technocracy 
for the purpose of capitalizing on what they thought they understood.  
Meanwhile, the idea, the content of Technocracy was there for all to 
see.
<P>
Howard Scott, in 1933, in giving a straightforward and objective 
exposition of conditions, and the strategy needed to meet those 
conditions, gave a nation-wide radio address from the prestigious Hotel 
Pierre in New York City.  He threw a brilliant light on the road ahead 
that society must travel. 
<P>
But understanding comes slowly for some people, especially so for those 
voluble individuals seeking a political platform to advance their brand 
of opinion.  It was to protect the nature and integrity of Technocracy 
that prompted Howard Scott to incorporate Technocracy under the laws of 
the state of New York. The reason-for-being of the organization is to 
educate the citizens of North America in the concepts required for 
operating their social system by the method of science. It must be seen 
that a method of social operation, such as Technocracy describes, is 
inevitable here in our situation, which is unique in the world, unless 
the forces marshalled against knowledge and human dignity gain the goal 
they apparently have in view. 
<P>
But "being inevitable" does not mean immediate. The acceptance of this 
new idea by the people of North America is slow at times. At other times 
it is more rapid but coming ever closer to a realization of what must be 
done if this civilization is to survive. But a "near miss" is not good 
enough; that could very well be fatal!  
<P>
Whether by reason of impetuosity -- with the best of intentions -- or by 
malicious intent -- many people through the years have attempted to 
take the organization off the road that is straight ahead. They failed. 
So far they have failed, because there were enough Technocrats with the 
intelligence to realize what they hold in their hands.   
<P>
One can only marvel at the intelligence of Howard Scott in seeing down 
the long straight road that society must travel to avoid the 
dissipation of this greatest of opportunities for this civilization.  
And also in conducting himself with the self discipline required of him to 
stay the course.
<P>
Citizens of North America can do no better than to follow his example.
