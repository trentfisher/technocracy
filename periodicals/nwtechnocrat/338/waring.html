<P>
The social design of science -- in concert with the cultural arts, 
is a dynamic social concept for scientific statesmanship in which 
the inter- dependent "laws of nature" proclaimed in the first paragraph 
of the American Declaration of Independence, serve as the unifying 
decision- determinants responsible for the functional governance of 
North America's technology, energy and natural resources in producing 
and providing the individually expressed physical and cultural human 
needs of the population of this Continent.
<P>
The inter-related, "laws of nature" -- discovered by the Scientific 
Method through research, measurement, experimentation and verification 
for predictability, can be functionally harmonized in North America.  This 
can be operational and include all branches of science to supply human 
needs, delivered daily to every person without the interference of 
money. 
<P>
It is the continuous Continental coordination and orchestration of 
our 38,000,000,000 mechanical/electrical horsepower (as of the 1990s) 
of high capacity technology on a dynamic energy balanced basis with 
the Continental land/resources that provide us with our life-style.  We 
can maintain a sustainable society with a non-wastage of materiels 
that can make possible a moderate and equitable standard of living 
for all individuals and families -- all in accord with each person's 
preferences.  The consequent high quality consumer goods and services 
will be obtained by every individual man, woman and child as a right 
of North American citizenship by means of their daily personal requisitions 
regardless of age, gender or race. 
<P>
No better model for the reorganization of their own social operations 
could be held up to the rest of the world than the actual operation 
of this Continent on a non-price basis.
<P>
The entire 6,000 year history of Price System ideology is a long account 
of human struggle with scarcity and its derivative woes.  What we 
see today is an increase in the magnitude of social instability that 
coincides with the continued improper control of our technology.  It 
is similar to an attempt to steer a vehicle at high speed with horse-and- 
buggy type technology.  Our society today responds in much the same 
manner to our technology being operated with an increase in extraneous 
(non-human) energy.  This results in an eventual complete loss of 
control. 
<P>
Technocracy has the only plan yet devised to operate our technology 
correctly.  Put simply, it is a plan which allows the people who built 
the technology to run it -- but for the benefit of the people directly 
instead of through the interference of business and politics for mindless 
profit.
<P>
Art, like technology, can flourish best in a culture such as that 
which is now within reach, where the adversarial relationships of 
the bazaar are no longer the rule, where leisure to enjoy life is 
for the first time universally available.  Ironically, the ingredients 
for that life style is here; we have only to realize what we have 
and organize our affairs to make use of it.
