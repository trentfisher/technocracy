.... What is correct procedure?  What constitutes good economic policy?  What
programs should be cut or added?  In other words, what is considered
good government depends on the politician or politicians you are listening 
to.  This further depends on whether they are in or out of office; 
whether they are due for re-election; who they are attempting to curry 
favour with; plus any other consideration that will affect their chances 
of re-election.  The recent elections in the U.S.A. resulted in a 
sweep toward the Republicans,  who are said to represent good conservative 
fiscal responsibility in government with the efficient use of money 
that will curb the monetary excesses.  Those words are said to be 
the hallmark of the Democrats, but Orange County, California, is a 
bastion of conservatism, a bulwark of Republicans and all that is 
supposed to stand for.  It is interesting that they      have now 
become  the largest local U.S. government to file for Chapter 9
bankruptcy.  This
county of 2.6 million residents Southeast of Los Angeles, home of 
the Nixon presidential library and Disneyland, was borrowing money 
short-term to buy longer-term bonds, but they were caught when interest 
rates soared this year.  Their investment portfolio tumbled when a 
group of investment bankers demanded repayment of $1.2 billion in 
short-term loans which was more than the fund could raise without 
selling depressed securities -- hence the bankruptcy protection.  Sound 
conservative fiscal management?  Is this what was voted for last November?  We 
wonder if this is what we can expect from their Federal counterparts?

....  In the days of deep seam coal mining, miners once carried caged 
canaries into the mines to warn them of a dangerous build-up of dangerous 
gas.  Birds are excellent indicators of environmental change.  The 
world's 9,600 plus bird species live in all regions; they respond 
quickly to environmental change and are among the easiest creatures 
to track and study.  Therefore, any drop in the world's bird species 
is an indication of environmental dangers that threaten us all.  Some 
seventy percent, about 6,600 of the world's bird species are declining, 
including 1,000 that are in imminent danger of extinction.  The reasons 
for this decline are numerous, but all those reasons threaten, not 
only birds, but the world's number one predator -- us.  We would 
do well to study what is depleting the bird population before it seriously 
affects our chances of survival.
<P>
....  In most countries, the largest cause of violent death, aside 
from war, is traffic fatalities.  In the European union, traffic fatalities 
kill four times as many people as homicides do; in North America it 
is twice as many.  Car accidents took nearly as many lives in the 
U.S., in 1993 alone, as the Vietnam war did in over a decade.  Still 
we persist in relying heavily on the automobile as a means of transportation 
and in operating our society in a manner which makes it's use mandatory.  We 
should realize that an efficient mass transportation system, coupled 
with a system of housing that would cut daily travel to a minimum, 
would not only result in a tremendous saving of resources -- but 
almost eliminate this appalling loss of life.  However, in a Price 
System, monetary expedience is the rule of the game; only the introduction 
of a functional government with a distribution system, based on energy 
accounting, would be able to introduce the necessary changes.
<P>
.... The world grain harvest of 1,682 million tons, in 1993, was 86 
million tons below the harvest of 1992.  With 86 million tons of grain 
less than in the previous year, there were 90 million more people 
to be fed.  The world's population is rising rapidly; can food production 
keep pace?  Looking at just these figures, it is extremely doubtful.  Just 
keeping up with the world population growth for one day, requires 
an additional 83,000 tons of grain.  Couple the increase in population 
with a declining resource base, a declining food supply and decline 
in potable water and there is the potential for world wide hostilities 
on a massive scale -- dwarfing the present level of hostilities 
which is causing so much misery and death.
<P>
.... The day is long past when we can administer our social operation 
with a system which effects its distribution on a medium of exchange 
based on debt tokens (or money).  Such a system is based on short-term 
monetary expediency and is no longer applicable in an age of high-speed 
technology.  In an age when, here in North America, in excess of 98% 
of everything we produce is done by means of extraneous energy -- 
that is energy outside of the human body.  Any attempt to measure 
the health of an economy by the number of person-hours employed, is 
ludicrous and self-defeating.  The attempt to keep this antiquated 
system operating is at the root of most of our present problems.  Only 
the replacement of this archaic system with one of function -- 
with a method of distribution based on energy accounting, can we hope 
to arrest our serious decline.  We can start to build a future in 
which we can all share in the high standard of life that modern technology 
can supply without any of the waste and destruction so evident in 
the world of today.
