<P>
Never before has the human race faced a situation that 
is anything like what it is now facing.  We seem to be on the edge 
of unparalleled disaster together with the peak of our achievements.  On 
the one hand never have so many people lived so well, while at the 
same time the future indeed appears dark.
<P>
There may be need to summarize; to be clear it seems necessary.  The 
expansion of human population across the planet cannot continue.  Food 
supplies are threatened by a collapse of soil fertility, fresh water, 
environmental degradation and so forth.  Crime is running rampant 
across the country.  The signs of social decay are everywhere.  Our 
economic system is faltering.  How have things gotten to this state 
and what can be done about it? 
<P>
In the 1930s, the study of economics took a serious turn for the worse.  The 
horrible depression of the thirties had stimulated a great deal of 
thinking about just what makes an economic system work.  Mathematical 
theories about the fickle financial finaglings of the fiscal system 
were being developed.  In view of the fact that almost all the economists 
of the day had guessed wrong, anything that would seem to improve 
the prognostication would be welcome.  So, fiscal guesswork became 
a respectable profession. 
<P>
Those who operated the Price System at the time were very frightened 
that they were about to lose their system and the benefits thereby 
accruing.  They lived in fear of any explanation that appeared at 
variance with the Price System.  The facts be damned, just keep the 
money coming!  The Commies were everywhere.  The Commies of course 
consisted of anyone whose point of view did not coincide with the 
current lords of the manor.
<P>
Into this social environment Technocracy Inc. offered, not simply 
a different explanation, but a completely different approach to the 
problems.  Technocracy proposed a scientific analysis of the operations 
of the social system -- analyzing the physical operations that 
made the system run.  In other words, rather than trying to figure 
out how an engine is running by the sound it makes or by looking at 
the exhaust fumes and watching the vibration it produces, why not 
try looking at the engine itself!  What Technocracy proposed was to 
measure the energy involved in social operations, because energy is 
the most fundamental property of any physical operation.  The laws 
of thermodynamics apply to the social system just like anything that 
has substance. 
<P>
The screams of outrage from the press both then and now, point to 
the fact that Technocracy was on to something.  When socialism was 
popular Technocracy was called Fascist.  When fascism was popular 
Technocracy was called Communist.  It is none of these.  The fact 
that the Price system press finds it necessary to lie about Technocracy, 
just about every time it bothers to mention it at all, testifies to 
just how frightened and ignorant they are. 
<P>
Technocracy's analysis points out that the Price System is destroying 
itself and that there really is no choice.  This will happen whether 
Technocracy is here or not.  Probably, an example of this is one that 
is obvious -- in agriculture: in 1830 about seventy percent of 
the population lived on or derived their living from the land.  Today, 
only about three percent survive this way.  Technology has replaced 
them.  Today, as the pace of technology quickens, we see jobs disappearing 
by the thousands.  The unskilled jobs are doomed, and even professional 
people with good degrees are becoming homeless! 
<P>
Rather than see this situation as a hopeless catastrophe, Technocracy 
realized that this requires a complete change of the social system.  And 
-- instead of being terrified of this; we should see that we are 
being presented with the greatest opportunity the human race has ever 
had!  It is we who have been given the possibility of moving the human 
race onto a whole new plane of social existence! 
<P>
Two major conclusions are inescapable.  If a society has the ability 
to produce enough for everyone, price disappears.  Agriculture is 
a perfect example of this.  When so much is produced that the price 
a farmer gets for his product falls below the cost of producing it, 
he will go out of business.  That is the reason so few farmers are 
still in business.  The other conclusion is that machines are excellent 
producers, but they don't consume much.  It is not necessary to directly 
replace a man with a machine.  What is needed is to increase the productivity 
of the machine; with this increased productivity you need fewer people.  This 
can only lead to one result, the destruction of the Price System. 
<P>
Technocracy realized that the people of North America would probably 
not be willing to voluntarily starve to death in the middle of the 
world's greatest super market.  If you can't operate a Price System, 
the simplest thing is to find a way to do without it; rather than 
to continue to try operating in an impossible situation.
<P>
Technocracy proposed operating the social system using energy as a 
basis for governing operations.  In such a system there can be no 
distinctions between individuals in computing consuming privileges; 
because to do so is to reestablish a Price System.  What people really 
want is an income, not a job! 
<P>
It doesn't take much reflection to realize that once a Price System, 
is abandoned, nearly all of the trappings that constitute the present 
governing system would become pointless.  A government of sorts is 
needed, but would constitute only a small fraction of what exists 
today.  Quite obviously the most important requirement would be to 
maintain the technology that keeps us all alive.  So Technocracy has 
proposed a structure for doing just that.  The only purpose of such 
a government would be to provide the population with what they want 
when and where they want it.
<P>
Comment:  Technocracy Inc. was formed as only an educational 
organization to help make the transition as smooth as possible.  The 
organization attempts to do this by informing as many people as possible 
about the course of events as well as warning about what will occur 
if we permit our technology to be destroyed.  Technocracy Inc. itself 
has no assumption of power theory.  That is, the organization has 
no plans to take over or form any government.  Once a functional form 
of government is established as proposed by Technocracy Inc. consisting 
of the top most capable people organized into functional sequences, 
the organization disbands.
