<P>
The name `Technocrat' may be applied to anyone who actively endorses
and advocates Technocracy as a form of social control in his Area.  So
far as we know, there are no Technocrats on the North American
Continent outside of the Organization of Technocracy Inc.  There may
be, and probably are, many potential Technocrats; but like potential
energy, they are dormant and without kinetic force.
<P>
In the literature of Europe and America especially America-there is
developing a tendency to employ the words `Technocracy' and
'Technocrat' rather loosely. The origins of such references are mostly
traceable to Roman Catholic writers of propaganda releases, but other
willful stooges of reactionism often pick up the words and carelessly
proliferate their applications in writings and speeches.
<P>
The plot among the Catholic propagandists evidently is to disparage
`Technocracy' and `Technocrats' through the well-worn propaganda
techniques of name-calling and unfavorable association. The worst
`association' that can be made today is to bracket something with
communist or with the Bolshevik Party of Russia. Hence, there are to
be seen such references as: `Red Technocrats,' in connection with the
scientifically-trained men in the government of Russia; `Malenkov, a
terrorist-technocrat'; and the `Technocracy of Russia.'
<P>
The implications of the word `Technocrat' are expanded further to
include those Americans and others who are active in designing and
installing machines for the production of abundance and the
displacement of human toil--who, of course, are deemed subversive of
the old values of Scarcity, Human Toil, and Insecurity, hence are
regarded as no less than emissaries of Satan. Less skilled writers and
speakers frequently go so far as to use the word `Technocracy' in
place of `technology' and the word `Technocrat' in reference to anyone
with scientific or technical training.
<P>
When these propagandists are challenged by Members of Technocracy with
reference to their use of the words in loose and improper ways, the
trite answer is that the words were intended to be spelled with a
small `t,' hence do not refer to Technocracy or Technocrats as an
organization or members thereof. In other words, presumably if
`technocracy' is spelled with a small `t,' it can be used in any sense
that the writer chooses.
<P>
The instances of such misuse of `Technocracy' and `Technocrat' are too
numerous for us to cite them specifically; but they are to be found in
various propaganda books, in popular magazines, in daily
newspapers--from the New York Times down to the Hearst papers--and in
the bulletins and house papers of various industrial and service
enterprises.
<P>
Literally, the word `Technocracy' means government by skill, as
contrasted to government by opinion--whether it be an autocracy
(government by one man's opinion), an aristocracy (government by the
opinions of an upper class), a plutocracy (government by the opinions
of the wealthy), or a democracy (government by everybody's opinion).
The word `Technocracy' was synthesized and casually used, but not
clearly defined, by others than Technocrats, even before the Twentieth
Century, but its current usage and definition pertain properly only to
the social concepts, organization, and membership which grew out of
the thinking and writings of Howard Scott. The application of the word
in any other connotation today is a clumsy usurpation and a fraud.
<P>
Technocracy is strictly a specific form of social control (or
government) which is designed to utilize the knowledge of science and
the methods of technology to produce and distribute an abundance of
goods and services to all citizens in its domain. It is a form of
social control in which the physical factors, not human opinions or
traditions, determine WHAT shall be done in the way of social
operation, as well as HOW it shall be done.
<P>
For example, the physical factors of this Continent demand that the
whole Continent be integrated with a high-capacity, low-cost
transportation network. Further, the physical factors indicate that
this must, for the major part, be a waterways network. Other forms of
transportation consume too much non-replaceable fuel and other
resources in ratio to the amount of material transported; hence, they
must be reduced to a secondary status and employed for special
functions.
<P>
<H3>Technocracy Is Opposed To</H3>
<P>
Technocracy as a form of social control is opposed to waste,
especially waste of non-replaceable energy and mineral supplies; it is
opposed to the inefficient degradation of energy; it is opposed to
shoddiness of manufacture; it is opposed to scarcity, especially
planned scarcity; and it is opposed to opinionated tyrannies (such as
fascism) as a means of social regulation. This is because the physical
factors needed in the operation and continuance of a high-energy
civilization on this Continent (or any other continent) would be
seriously handicapped by the prevalence of any of these.
<P>
The resultants of Technocracy applied to the North American Continent
would be: The production and distribution of all the goods and
services that the entire population of the Continent would
require. Reduction of human effort to the minimum that the effective
operations of the Continent would permit. The maximization of both
Continental and individual security. Obligation of every Citizen to
contribute his pro rata share of time and effort in manning the
operations of the Continent.  which amount would be very meager,
indeed, as compared to Price System expectations. The highest standard
of health and education that it would be possible for a society to
maintain. The individual human. being would derive a great deal more
from the system than he or she would contribute to it. Hence, everyone
would live on a heritage of unearned wealth, a circumstance which,
today, is permitted to only a very few of `the best people.'
<P>
This is the only form of social control or government that legitimately
car be called a `Technocracy.'  There are no technocracies in the
world today. All governments on the earth, now are Price System
tryrannies, whether they are autocratic, fascistic, republican,
socialistic, or a hybrid combination of two or more of these. The
present governments of the United States and Canada are goulashes of
all these elements.
<P>
Propagandists, whether in the economic, political, or religious
fields, have had a long experience in, and have perfected various
techniques for propagating deception. One of these techniques, as we
have already indicated, is that of `association.'  The trick is to
take something and attempt to influence opinion for or against it by
associating it with something else regarding which either a favorable
or unfavorable opinion has already been formed. For example, the
advertising propaganda of the soap companies may associate a certain
trade name with a popular movie actress, both by pictorial means and
with testimonials. The theory is, if the public loves the movie
actress it will also love that soap.
<P>
The authoritarians have despised science from its inception and have
tried to associate it with everything unsavory that could be
imagined. Under their influence, Hollywood has repeatedly depicted
scientists as sadists, maniacs, and screwballs in the cinema
productions. In this way, an attempt is continually being made to
discredit science in the opinion of the public.
<P>
The form of social governance that the authoritarians despise above
all others is Technocracy; for, in a Technocracy, decisions based upon
authority and opinion would be reduced to a minimum. In comparison to
Technocracy, the authoritarians consider communism to be `lovely';
for, they can still `do business' under communism, although perhaps
not as happily as under fascism.  However, a considerable amount of
success has been achieved in non-communist countries toward branding
communism as obnoxious and heretical, and on the basis of this success
a cold war hysteria has been instigated and maintained in America
against the Soviet Union and affiliated nations.
<P>
<H3>Disdain For Fascism</H3>
<P>
During World War II. a certain disdain for fascism developed in
America and some other countries, although the authoritarians did not
take an active part in promoting this disdain; rather, they actively
tried to soft-pedal it and direct the stigma toward the personalities
of Hitler, Mussolini, and Tojo (but not against Pacelli, Victor
Emanuel, or Hirohito; for, evidently, the former were considered
expendable but the latter were not).
<P>
In character with true propaganda techniques of the authoritarians,
Technocracy was proclaimed to be `fascistic' during World War II. But,
as soon as the war was over, the communism was branded as the mortal
enemy of authoritarianism (while fascism was blessed with absolution),
and in complete disregard for intellectual consistency the
propagandists of authoritarianism associate Technocracy with
communism, Technocrats were no longer depicted in cartoons as
goose-stepping fascists, but were transformed into swaggering
commissars.  The Hearst papers went so far as to lump the four great
heresies together into one `brotherhood' -- Science, Technocracy,
Communism. and Atheism.
<P>
Various petty officials have, from time to time, attempted to brand
Technocracy as `subversive,' but the reasons for such (when given at
all) have always been very vague and evasive. When investigated, these
petty persons usually turn out to be affiliates or dupes of some
organized intrusion of authoritarianism on this Continent-which is
opposed to abundance, security, and freedom from toil for the
inhabitants of North America. More often than not, their allegiance is
oriented more toward Rome than toward the welfare of this
Continent. They tend to belong to outfits who think that characters
like Joe McCarthy are great guys. Such petty subversives and dupes are
to be found in the Armed Forces, in veterans organizations, in
industrial public relations personnel, in the schools, and in
professional agencies charged with persecution of heretics.
<P>
<H3>Subversiveness</H3>
<P>
But no charges of subversiveness against Technocracy can be
substantiated; for, Technocracy has none of the elements of a
subversive organization. It has no foreign connections; only citizens
of North America can be Members of Technocracy.  It neither supports
nor propagates any foreign ideology-political, economic, or
ecclesiastical. Although Technocracy is objectively analytical and
critical in its appraisals of trends and developments on this and
other continents, it neither conducts nor advocates any action against
the governments of this Continent nor against any of their official
enactments, whether the latter are arrived at by strictly legal means
or otherwise. Technocracy neither takes nor advocates any destructive
action against the established institutions of this Continent, whether
in the economic, political, or religious fields. Technocracy has never
opposed the war efforts of this Continent nor advocated evasion of
wartime regulations, no matter how unwise they may have been. Members
of Technocracy have served their respective countries faithfully in
all branches and all ranks of the Armed Forces. They have served in
super-secret capacities, and none have been convicted of violating
their trust. (That is more than can be said of certain honorable
Senators and Congressmen, not to mention bankers and industrialists.)
<P>
Technocracy Inc. is a 100 per cent North American organization, having
originated on this Continent, being active only on this Continent,
having a membership made up only of citizens of this Continent, and
its social objectives pertaining only to North America.
<P>
<H3>Total Conscription</H3>
<P>
During World War II and again during the Korean `police action,'
Technocracy urged the institution of Total Conscription as the most
effective means of organizing this Continent for defense and saving
human lives and resources. In this, Technocracy went further, and
placed itself on record as being far more patriotic than any other
organization or agency in America. Many labor union locals and other
minor groups endorsed Technocracy's Total Conscription Program; but
the upholders of inefficiency, graft, and international gangsterism
opposed it; and few of the large daily newspapers or slick magazines
had a good word for it. Technocrats are proud of their Organization's
stand on this issue, and of the enemies it made.
<P>
Technocrats are proud to stand on their program of Abundance,
Security, and Freedom from Toil for all North Americans, regardless of
what the grafters of the Price System and the crackpots of
authoritarianism think of them and their program. The howls and
yappings of the Roman Catholic press and the communist press against
Technocracy are music to the ears of Technocrats; we rejoice that
these social elements have aligned themselves on the other side.
<P>
Technocracy will not promise to be silent about waste, human toil,
premeditated scarcity, subversiveness, mismanagement, and
authoritarian inquisitions on this Continent.
<P>
<H3>The Most For The Least</H3>
<P>
Technocracy advocates the most and the best for the people of this
Continent, with the least social cost in energy, resources, and human
effort.  It shall yield only to those who can devise a program which
goes beyond that of Technocracy Inc.  in the achievement of these
objectives; but it will not yield to, or compromise with, any who fall
short of it. To the former, we should be glad to yield even the name
`Technocracy.' However, no such eventuality is imminent, even as a
probability.
<P>
The Organization and Membership of Technocracy Inc. define
`Technocracy' (whether with a large or little `T') as any social
system which is organized and integrated on an Area basis to apply the
knowledge of science and the methods of technology to the physical
operations of the Area, and which has the objective of achieving the
highest sustained standard of living for all of its inhabitants that
its physical factors permit, and whose ultimate objectives are the
production and distribution of abundance, the achievement of the
maximum security for the Area and its citizens, and the reduction of
human effort and vigilance to a minimum. Any application of the term
`Technocracy' to anything inferior to this, we contend, is dishonest
and inaccurate.
<P>
<H3>A Technocrat</H3>
<P>
The name `Technocrat' may be applied to anyone who actively endorses
and advocates Technocracy as a form of social control in his Area. So
far as we know, there are no Technocrats on the North American
Continent outside of the Organization of Technocracy Inc. There may
be, and probably are, many potential Technocrats; but, like potential
energy, they are dormant and without kinetic force. In fact, there is
no vehicle of expression for Technocrats or would-be-Technocrats
outside of the Organization of Technocracy Inc.
<P>
Technocracy has become firmly established on the North American
Continent as a definite and specific form of social operation; and the
name `Technocrat' applies only to one who actively supports that form
of Area Control. So, when anyone attempts to apply those words to
anything or anyone else, or to make inaccurate associations, you can
put him down as a propagandist for, or a dupe of, some agency whose
objectives for the people of North America are the antithesis of those
proclaimed by Technocracy.
