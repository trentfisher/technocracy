... The Ozone hole is getting larger.  According to a U.N. 
advisory panel, serious atmospheric ozone depletion has spread 
from the polar regions to the temperate zones and is far worse 
than anyone thought.  It now covers almost all of North America, 
Europe, the area that was the Soviet Union, Australia, New 
Zealand, and much of Latin America.  Previously CFCs caused some 
ozone loss in the temperate zones during winter and early spring, 
but now there also seems to be significant decreases in summer 
when people expose the most skin for the greatest amount of time.  
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency had predicted that ozone 
loss would cause 200,000 additional skin-cancer deaths in the U.S. 
alone over the next fifty years; this was before the issue of this 
latest report.  Even the enjoyment of the summer sun now poses a 
hazard; what havoc we have produced in mindless attempts to 
maintain a Price System -- its very existence threatens ours.
<p>
... Burning oil used for fuels is the primary cause of lead 
pollution in the United States, this according to an environmental 
study recently released.  The study was undertaken by a group 
consisting of: National Resources Defence Council, Sierra Club, 
Izaak Walton League of America and the Hazardous Waste Treatment 
Council.  The study said that just 5% of the 5.3 billion litres of 
used oil generated each year from cars and industrial equipment is 
refined into clean oil.  Approximately 56%, or 2.96 billion 
litres, that is intended for recycling is merely diluted with 
clean oil before it is resold and burned for residential and 
commercial use.  This results in the release of almost 272 tons of 
lead into the air every year.  The study further reported that 36% 
of used oil is dumped into landfills or storm sewers.  Lead has 
been linked to physical and mental impairment among youths.  
Ponder that for awhile.
<p>
... Because of new recovery techniques, made possible by modern 
technology, the U.S. is in the midst of its greatest gold boom, 
and the U.S. is now the world's second biggest gold producer, next 
to South Africa.  This year some 10 million ounces will be 
recovered, a significant increase over the 3.9 million ounces 
unearthed by the miners with burros in 1852, the peak year of the 
first gold rush.  More than 400 million acres administered by the 
U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management are open to 
mining claims.  As a result of this, considerable damage has been 
done to the environment.  The U.S. Bureau of Mines estimates that 
10,000 miles of rivers have been contaminated by mine wastes.  
Approximately 3.6 billion tons pile up each year, largely immune 
from federal hazardous wastes regulations.  Acid drainage and 
metallic poisons seep continually from old diggings.  Cadmium, 
nickel, lead, mercury, arsenic, contaminate rivers, lakes and
soil. Something like 500,000 acres of worked-out claims now lie 
abandoned.  The biggest project in the Environmental Protection 
Agency's Superfund is the abandoned Berkeley open-pit copper mine 
in Butte, Montana.  To clean up more than 240 million cubic yards 
of toxic wastes carried along 130 miles of river and spread over 
thousands of acres will cost $1.5 billion.  Free enterprise at 
its finest.
<p>
... In a report recently released by the Federal Government of 
Canada, it was found that three-quarters of Canada's chlorine 
consuming pulp mills are dumping wastes lethal to fish into our 
rivers and seas, spreading poisons as far away as 1,400 kilometres 
from their source.  The report says that the mills effluent 
remains deadly to fish even at concentrations as low as 3% waste 
and 97% water.  At even lower concentrations, as little as one 
half of one percent effluent, there are sub-lethal effects such as 
reproductive problems.  Canadian mills dump one million tons of 
chlorine based wastes into the environment annually, a soup of at 
least 250 compounds, some still unidentified.  If the time ever 
comes when they decide to clean up this mess, guess who will be 
stuck with the bill?  Companies pollute; the community pays -- 
and in more ways than one -- these poisons affect us all.
<p>
... So it goes, an almost daily litany of the continued assault on 
our environment, our home.  If all of today's problems had occured 
in a short space of time the outcry would have been tremendous.  
But it is happening slowly over a period of years, and most people 
come to accept it.  However, the accumulation over time is deadly, 
and the effect upon our livelihood -- and our future well-being is, 
or should be, deadly to contemplate.  We are gambling with the 
future of ourselves and, most definitely, that of our children and 
grandchildren.  For nearly sixty years Technocracy has been 
warning of the consequences of the abuse of technology that occurs 
in an attempt to perpetuate an obsolescent system based on price 
and commodity eveluation, a system that has long ago outlived its 
usefulness, and now threatens our very existence.  We have 
everything we need to overcome our problems; what is needed is to 
eliminate the interference -- money.

More next issue.
