<p>
Some of us believe that, if words are written in a law book they 
automatically assume a characteristic of veracity akin to 
scriptural writings.  Lawyers conventionally cite a list of 
precedents in arguing their cases; they seem never to question 
whether bribes, nepotism or whatever caused a previous case to be 
 money.
<p>
The Nov. 4, 1991 <cite>Newsweek</cite> had an interesting story
entitled ``Why I Quit Practicing Law'' by Sam Benson.  Benson said he
quit because he
was tired of the chicanery and the misery he caused other people.  
He did a pretty good job of describing lawyering.  This was no 
news to most people, but he did well in describing how lawyers are 
locked into a system that is adversarial by nature and within 
which lawyers can only senselessly attack with one sole objective 
-- that of winning.
<p>
Ideas of fairness, honesty, morality or of solving problems are 
simply not germane.  And, if Benson were to enlarge the scope of 
his observations, he should be able to see that the entire social 
system is based on adversarial relationships, not just within the 
operating methods of lawyers alone.
<p>
The entire legal system is European in origin.  The Romans had an 
influence and later English jurisprudence was studied and copied.  
Those ideas were almost exclusivly concerned with property -- who 
owns what, and, it is to be remembered, that women and minorities 
were considered property in varying degrees when the U.S. 
Constitution was written; and it was only after the main business 
of writing the Consitution was accomplished that the Bill of Rights 
was added on.
<p>
So, even now, we aren't too far advanced from the times when two 
Roman gentlemen in disagreement would enter the arena, not to 
fight but to watch their champions fight to the death, the 
gentlemen having agreed to consider the owner of the champion who 
was still alive to be the winner.  Today, our proxies, lawyers, 
although in a modified form still carry on that ancient tradition.
<p>
Long ago our civilization was organized based on adversarial 
concepts.  And now, despite our natures, we must treat each other 
as adversaries; so is it any wonder that we are so confounded with 
contradictions that we act the way we do?
<p>
Our history books contain distortion, and our political leaders 
tell us fairy tales.  We hear claims that there is such a thing as 
"truth in advertising" but we know that any commercial on TV is 
mostly exaggeration.  We need to become aware that our social 
system itself has become our collective adversary.  As a society 
we have relaxed and allowed ourselves to become stuck with a bad 
deal, now we must make the effort to get out of it.
<p>
Only Technocracy provides a social design for a society that is 
compatible with the physical situation we find ourselves in.
