<p>
On January 13, 1933, North Americans gathered around radios to 
listen to a live broadcast by Howard Scott, as he addressed an 
audience of industrial magnates at the Hotel Pierre in New York 
City.  These captains of industry had come to hear Scott's 
presentation on the findings of the research group known as the 
Technical Alliance of which Howard Scott was Chief Engineer.
<p>
Scott was no politician or businessman, as the listeners soon 
found out.  He began with a brief background of the Technical 
Alliance which had spent fourteen years on an objective study of 
the effects of science and technology on social change in North 
America.
<p>
He went on to point out the dramatic increases in population 
growth in certain parts of the world, particularly in the North 
American Continent.  Then, he proceeded to dash to pieces some 
preciously-held concepts.
<p>
The reason for population increase and the improvement in the 
standard of living of the industrialized nations, Scott 
pronounced, was not due to financial philosophy or form of 
political government.  The Technical Alliance found that, as 
technology is introduced to production, it is the purely physical 
factor of the time rate of doing work -- the reduction of time 
required to convert energy into forms usable to humans -- that is 
directly responsible for meeting the needs of, and making 
possible, the growth of populations and improvement in the 
standard of living.
<p>
In societies previous to the introduction of the steam engine to 
industry, around 1840, work was carried out mainly by human muscle 
power, with a little help from animals and water wheels.  
Production was carried out at the speed of the hand tool, and was 
naturally slow.  This low-energy state had prevailed throughout 
recorded history.
<p>
It was during this time of low energy conversion, reaching back 
some 7000 years, that the present concepts of government, finance, 
and the virtues of sweat-of-the-brow labor were conceived and 
refined.  Also, during this period of time there came into being 
the current distribution system that Technocracy calls the Price 
System -- that is, any social system that effects the production 
and distribution of goods and services using money.
<p>
The world was still toiling in a state of low-energy conversion 
when, in 1776, Adam Smith published what was to become the classic 
economic theory we still employ to control production and 
distribution.
<p>
Scott pointed out that this theory, which is based largely on the 
assumption that human labor determines the value of goods and 
services, is inappropriate in a high-energy civilization.  As more 
extraneous energy -- that is, energy derived from a source other 
than human power -- is introduced into industry, production 
increases.  At the same time, the necessity for human labor 
decreases.  Therefore, the factor of human labor is no longer 
applicable.
<p>
At the same time production increases, man-hours must decrease.  
And, since man-hours generate consuming power in the form of 
wages, consuming power must decrease.
<p>
This trend may best be seen in the accompanying chart, a composite 
of the analysis of over 3000 aspects of the social structure of 
North America -- from resources to energy consumption to 
industrial output.  Technocracy employs the chart not as support 
for its observations, but as the reason for them.  It is also what 
made it possible for Technocracy to make, over fifty years ago, 
projections about societal trends that are showing up now.
<p>
<img src="../../../images/curves.gif" alt="[graph of man-hours and
production]" WIDTH=564 HEIGHT=454>
<p>
As may be seen in the "Physical Production" line, the amount of 
goods produced has increased in proportion to the installment of 
machinery.  In the days before the introduction of the steam 
engine to industry, 98% of the labor was carried out by muscle 
power.  It was during this time that the Price System, the only 
method of distribution now in use in the world (with the possible 
exception of a few isolated tribes) came into being.
<p>
From 1840 on, we saw an increase in "Total Employment in Man-Hours."
This trend continued until the mid-1920s. when a peak was
reached.  The decrease in total industrial employment has been 
constant ever since, as business has introduced labor-saving 
devices, or farmed out its labor to foreign countries, to maintain 
its profit margins.  It has been successful at this, as labor, once 
the largest expense business had to deal with, only accounts now 
for about 10% of operating expenses.
<p>
Now observe the "Man Hours Per Unit Production" line.  Compare 
this curve with the "Production" line.  It is clear that man-hours,
both as a method of determining value and as a source of
consuming power in the form of wages, are on the way out.
<p>
In his address, Scott pointed this out, and said that as this 
trend continued, we would see progressively more severe periods of 
unemployment and loss of consuming power, "not in technological 
employment, but in a reduction of total employment and of total 
purchasing power."  (It may be noted here that the only way 
purchasing power has been maintained has been by the creation of 
an imponderable debt structure.)
<p>
Scott observed that rather than the amount of labor that goes into 
producing goods or services, it is the scarcity of supply that 
dictates value, and scarcity is incompatible with a technology 
capable of producing an abundance for everyone.  He drew a very 
definite line between physical wealth, the actual conversion of 
energy into use-able forms, and monetary wealth, which is nothing 
more than the ability to create debt.
<p>
It is time, he told the nation, for a new way of operating the 
Continent, one that would unleash the tremendous productive 
capacity of North America for the benefit of all citizens.  It is 
time for a governance not of people, but of the physical plant of 
North America by those most qualified.  Get the politicians and 
financiers out of the way, Scott declared, and the Continent would 
witness a prosperity such as the world has never before seen.
<p>
These observations, as may be expected, were bitter gall to 
industrialists who spoke in terms of dividends and profit margins.  
They had come to hear how they could get out of the Depression 
with their corporate skins intact and resume business as usual.  
Here was this man talking about energy conversion and the time 
rate of doing work.  He even went so far as to say that all such 
special interest groups as liberals, debt merchants, and 
communists would wind up sharing "the mud of the last ditch 
wherein they now struggle so valiantly."
<p>
The industrialists clicked their tongues, shook their heads, and 
proceeded to write Technocracy off as just another will-O'-the-wisp,
like the Townsend plan.  Then they went off to the
government, hats in hand.  They even tried to hire Scott at a 
princely wage, but Scott refused to be bound by what he called 
their "platinum handcuffs."
<p>
Technocracy's researchers were summarily dismissed from Columbia 
University.  Scott later maintained that he had in his possession 
a telegram directing all employees of the Hearst Corporation never 
to mention Technocracy again if they wanted to keep their jobs.
<p>
Not everyone was cowed by the bluster of the media megaliths, 
however.  The VANCOUVER SUN heralded Technocracy's program for 
social reconstruction as "North America's Great Chance".  The 
Decatur, Illinois, HERALD-REVIEW headlined it as the "CURE FOR 
ECONOMIC ILLS".  Encyclopedia Americana called it the "only 
program of social and economic reconstruction which is in technical 
accord with the age in which we live."  H.G. Wells spoke of it as 
a sound method of placing economics on a purely physical basis.
<p>
Simply stated, Technocracy's three-curve chart shows that, with 
the installation of high-production machinery, we should be 
enjoying more and working less.
<p>
So why, one may ask, is the average North American working six 
more hours per week than in 1976?  Why do we endure poverty in the 
midst of such potential?  Why do we see record numbers of murders 
being committed?  Why do our prisons house a greater proportion of 
inmates than any other nation?  Why do we destroy food or leave 
fields unplanted as people go hungry?  Why have we fouled our air 
and water?  Why do we fritter away precious natural resources on 
shoddy or non-essential goods, or on the needless duplication of 
production in the name of "competitive enterprise"?
<p>
The answer lies in our slavish adherence to the outmoded monetary
structure, or Price System. It is the Price System, and our diehard
efforts to preserve it regardless of the cost to human society and our
physical environment, that accounts for the vast majority of the
social and environmental stress we are witnessing.
<p>
It is the adherence to this Price System, the forced shortage of
supply in order to keep up prices, or value, that is the root cause of
the inequity in distribution that gives rise to a great many of our
social problems: crime, poverty, wars, stress-induced drug, alcohol,
child and spouse abuse, bribery, political corruption -- even the
dissolution of the family structure, as both parents are forced out of
the home into the workplace in order to make ends meet.
<p>
It is also the Price System and its use of contrived methods to 
effect the consumption of tangible resources, that has led to the 
misuse of our technology to increasingly devastate our earth.
<p>
Howard Scott and the Technical Alliance, applying the scientific 
method to the social structure and by subjecting it to objective 
analysis, concluded that a technological administration of the 
physical functions of the Continent was the next most probable 
state of society -- the destiny of North America.  To attempt to 
forestall or prevent such a conversion would ultimately result in 
social and environmental chaos.
<p>
The Technocracy organization maintains that the distribution of
abundance to all is a technical not a political or financial
problem. We have in North America the installed equipment, the
resources, and the technological know-how to offer to every citizen
the highest standard of living in the world, with a minimum of human
toil.
<p>
In North America we have have reached a parting in the road; one way
leads to a continuation of the increasing social ills already in
progress, and the other leads to a solution, once and for all, of the
social inequities which have plagued mankind for centuries. At
present, this Continent, as predicted by Technocracy, is in a
transitional period; and a deliberate effort is required for its
citizens to move off the track leading to chaos. More study and
understanding is necessary. An investigation of Technocracy's
Technological Social Design is essential.
