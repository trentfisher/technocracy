Technocracy's analysis points out the disintegration of today's 
social structure, the Price System; and makes clear that current 
social problems are inevitably its by-product. What is a Price 
System?  It is any social system that effects its distribution of 
goods and services by means of money.  This constitutes a "Price 
System" irrespective of whether the ownership in that social 
system is individual or collective.  With very small exceptions, 
every country in the world is ruled by some variation of the Price 
System.  In view of political foolishness and the failure of the 
Price System to meet the needs of the people, it is obvious that 
some changes need to be made.
<p>
Let us start with basics.  It is a fact that our highly 
technological society is too complex to be administered by any 
form of politics.  But there is one other option; the North American 
Continent needs a scientifically formed government managed by 
functional people who are chosen for their ability and without the 
interference of politics and business.
<p>
Technocracy's synthesis is a social design that utilizes science 
and technology in the social operation of North America.  
Operations will be organized into functional sequences involving 
communications, transportation, manufacturing, distribution, 
housing, education and so on for an estimated total of 98 
sequences, all to be coordinated via a continental control board 
consisting of the most competent person of each sequence, as 
chosen by members of that sequence.  There is much more to the 
design of the ``Technate''; it requires study to understand 
``Functional Control'' with its ``built-in'' checks and balances.
<p>
Technocracy is the result of using the scientific method in 
organizing society.  Details are provided in the pamphlet entitled 
<a href="../../../ttsd/">Technocracy - Technological Social
Design.</a>  Request a copy at your local library.
<p>
Please remember it is our future, (our's and our children's) that 
is at stake.
