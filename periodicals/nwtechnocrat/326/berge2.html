As <cite>Discover</cite> magazine of November 1991 reports, laughing gas is no 
joke.  Used mostly by dentists as an anesthetic, nitrous oxide, or 
N<sub>2</sub>O, got the name laughing gas, possibly because of involuntary 
laughter sometimes elicited from patients.  But now in this 
instance, nitrous oxide is unfunny with a vengeance.
<p>
The concentration in the atmosphere of nitrous oxide now is only 
about one-thousandth that of carbon dioxide or CO<sub>2</sub>, but it seems 
to be increasing.  CO<sub>2</sub>, is a greenhouse gas and much has been said 
lately about the greenhouse effect and its causes which affects 
mostly the lower atmosphere.
<p>
But the ozone layer is at high altitude and functions like a 
blanket of atoms consisting of ozone that protects life on earth 
from the terrific barrage of ultra-violet radiation coming from 
the sun.  Scientists have described the condition and warn of its 
danger.  The ozone hole is a thinning out of the ozone layer that 
becomes apparent when the upper air currents change with the 
seasons.  The ozone layer because of its thinning out then allows 
a hole to form. One cause is CFCs, or chloroflourocarbons, a gas 
or gases used in air conditioners, refrigerators and industry.  
One atom of chlorine, from CFCs, attacks 200,000 atoms of ozone, 
and, since CFCs take about a quarter century to reach the level 
where they destroy the ozone layer, it follows that the 
destruction occurring now is the result of CFCs released years 
ago, and CFCs have been released in increasing amounts in the 
intervening years.
<p>
Nitrous oxide has more effect on ozone than CFCs do, but where it 
was coming from was a mystery until a chemist, Mark Thiemens of 
the University of San California at San Diego, identified a 
previously unknown source -- nylon manufacturing.  Thiemens 
estimates that nylon manufacturers worldwide emit 727,000 tons of 
N<sub>2</sub>O annually.  This gas lives on for 150 years.
<p>
The threat of the ozone hole was presented to politicians, but 
this was really an exercise in futility, because politicians are 
agents of business; they stayed in character and resolved to 
postpone any action.  The people that were voted for and expected 
to be responsible for the country haven't moved yet -- maybe they 
can't!  Citizens of North America should be able to see that 
politicians really are mediocrity.  We must face it; politics can kill us.
<p>
Technocracy has a social design that was put together to handle 
problems that an increasingly technological society will be 
confronted with.
