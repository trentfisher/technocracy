<p>
Show us a democracy anywhere in this world, and we will show you 
the man on the moon, his ears stuffed with green cheese.
<p>
After repeated failures in elections -- failure to get the right 
person in, failure to pass any workable bills to control 
pollution, crime, the economy, unemployment, disease, hunger, 
inadequate housing, deteriorating infrastructure -- and failure 
in just about every aspect of our present social order, less then 
40 percent of the people still entertain the past by exercising 
their precious right to vote.
<p>
"If you don't vote, then you have nothing to say about what goes 
on in this country," we non-voters are told.  But when less than 
40 percent of the population make it to the polls, isn't this non-
voter majority saying more by their silence than all the political 
hubbub of the voters and their politicians combined?  (In 1986 
voting dropped to its lowest level in four decades -- 37.3 
percent. Some 178 million Americans could have voted.  Only 
66 million did.)
<p>
Just what do we get for our vote?  Right now we have a president, 
a clone of our former president, who picked a vice-president with 
the qualifications of a department-store mannequin.  Some say, 
with tongue in cheek, that the vice-president was chosen for his 
bodyguard qualifications: considering the alternative, no one 
would dare take a shot at the president.
<p>
So we had eight years with a president whose greatest achievement 
was making the people feel good about their country.  And now we 
are threatened by another eight years with a man who, along with 
his cohorts, ran one of the dirtiest campaigns in history; with a 
man who stands up for the flag and wants to pass legislation to 
punish those who, as their means of being heard, would burn it; 
with a man who thinks nothing of burning innocent human beings in 
Panama to get one scapegoat, a former ally of the U.S., under the 
pretense that the United States was protecting U.S. citizens after 
one U.S. serviceman was killed when he entered a zone that was off 
limits to U.S. citizens.  Thousands of Panamanians died, as well 
as 23 American servicemen -- nine of them killed by other 
Americans.  What an ingenious way to protect American citizens.
<p>
Cedric Belfrage, a jounalist and one of the founders of The 
National Guardian in the 1940s, sent out this warning many years 
ago:
<p>
<blockquote>
   "Let us not be blind to the fact that the majority of Americans 
   are under the spell of a few men who rule their destinies and 
   mold their minds -- and these rulers and molders can only be 
   properly described as know-nothings who make glory out of 
   knowing nothing, because to know is to shatter the entire 
   edifice of fraud that has been built up."
</blockquote>
<p>
Today the new generation of Americans seems more immune than ever 
to the lies handed out by their government.  Once again we are 
courting another Vietnam, and young soldiers, who are not so far 
removed from that particular war, go uncomplaining to do battle in 
the Persian Gulf, a crisis that came just in time to ward off 
peace and give the military a shot in the "arms."  This new crisis 
also helps to take American citizens' minds off poverty, except 
for those who live in poverty.  Suddenly the war on drugs begins 
to retreat as this new-found enemy takes its place in order to 
ensure the perpetuation of social-problem amnesia.
<p>
And so we should go to the polls and vote for more of the same?
<p>
What is particularly amazing is the parents of our new warriors, 
who did live through the time of the Vietnam debacle, are so 
willingly letting their children go off to another war debacle to 
spill their young blood for oil barons.  According to a recent 
Wall Street Journal/NBC Poll released August 21, the Newsweek 
Poll released August 20 and the New York Times Poll released 
August 12, 72 percent approve of how George Bush handles the 
Middle East conflict; 16 percent disapprove.  To the question, 
"Should the U.S. take military action if Iraq invades Saudi 
Arabia?"  74 percent approve; 16 percent disapprove.  To the 
question, "Should the U.S. take military action if terrorists 
loyal to Iraq kill Americans anywhere?"  67 percent approve; 21 
percent disapprove.  And 34 percent approve of assassinating 
Saddam Hussein as a way of quickly ending the current Middle East 
crisis, ignoring historical fact to the contrary.
<p>
Families are forming support groups to cope with anxiety they feel 
over their loved ones who may face a bloody battle or chemical 
warfare, but they are proud of these offspring they let go off to 
war.  There is nothing that kindles the fires of emotion like 
bands playing, spectators cheering and young heroes marching off 
to battle, even though they might wind up as dead or maimed 
heroes.
<p>
Some would have us believe that an unrelenting God for some 
inexplicable reason "wants it this way."  (Is it any wonder that 
Harry Truman was thankful that "God was on our side" when he 
ordered the bomb dropped on Japan?)  If one God looks over all, 
would he/she take sides?
<p>
And where are all those noisy people who believe in the sanctity 
of life?  Can't you just hear their silence regarding our youth 
going off to war in the Middle East?  Why are fully developed 
human beings less important than undeveloped fetuses?
<p>
Then, of course, if peace should break out on all fronts and our 
yankees came home, unemployment would know no bounds.  We already 
have mass unemployment due to most businesses modernizing their 
operations, which means installing more machines.  If they didn't 
modernize, they would be forced to take a back seat to more 
innovative corporations.  (And, by the way, you don't see the 
presidents of successful business corporations being voted in by 
persons who haven't the foggiest notion of operational procedures.  
They are chosen for their qualifications.  But the president of 
the United States?????)
<p>
Even if all citizens over 18 attended the next election (including 
the mentally retarded as is allowed in Canada) and voted for jobs 
for everyone, their vote would not be heard; but if they would 
just listen, they could hear the whir of machines replacing jobs.  
Politicians and their consituents cannot hear what is going on 
over the din of their own political rhetoric:  "Fight crime!  
Build more jails!  Do something about those unsightly street 
people; they are an embarrassment to American democracy!  Put then 
to work!"  And they would force people into honoring a flag that 
has come to represent all the misery they see around them, the 
dissolution of hope.
<p>
And no matter whom we elect for president or any other political 
office, beneficial change would not occur.  Any thinking person 
should know that you can't appease everyone.  When the facts are 
in, you do what is needed, not what pleases a certain segment of 
the population.  Yet politicians spend more time and money 
planning for the next election than they do trying to bring about 
improvements for the general populace whom they claim to 
represent. They are so wrapped up in these inane activities that 
they can't find time to consider the fact that social change is 
already here, and they aren't keeping up with it.  Our 
technological age has become too complicated for political action, 
so we are swamped with political inaction.
<p>
Webster's New Twentieth Century Dictionary defines democracy as:  
the acceptance and practice of the principle of equality of 
rights, opportunity and treatment.  Well, if all capable citizens 
don't have that cherished job, they aren't being treated equal are 
they?  If all citizens don't have adequate housing, clothing, 
food, medical care and purchasing power, they aren't being treated 
equal, are they?  And do the youth of this land of free speech 
have anything to say about this atrocity if they had attended the 
last election and voted?  After all, they have only one life to 
give for their business tycoons.  They ought to have some say 
regarding this precious possession.  So much for democracy and 
voting in the land of the fee and the home of the knave.
