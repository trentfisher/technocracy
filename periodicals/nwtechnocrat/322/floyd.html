To the editor:
<p>
Recently, a meeting was held to discuss a proposal titled 
"Environment 2010."  The 2010 refers to the year 2010, when 
agencies hope to have a plan so action can be taken.
<p>
The fault with taking so long is that we may very well not have 20 
years before the situation becomes irreversible.  Why devote 20 
years to do a study that has already been researched and a 
detailed blueprint drawn up to overcome the problem.
<p>
In 1919, a group of citizens, much the same as the group which met 
here, gathered to study the effect on our economy of the terrible 
wastage of resources used to fight the war.  The group was known 
as The Technical Alliance of North America, and consisted of 
several highly regarded and influential people.
<p>
At their own expense they rented space at Columbia University to 
look into the problem.  Their study lasted 14 years -- to 1933.  
The research led them to all phases of social problems which they 
could see were going to require a solution if our society could be 
expected to survive.  They could see that there would be serious 
problems with unemployment due to the increasing use of extraneous 
energy and the installation of modern technology.  They were also 
concerned with the wasteful use of our water supply, and with 
people being forced to go without food and live in the streets.  
An increasing crime rate could be safely predicted.
<p>
By consolidating all the facts they uncovered, they formulated a 
solution and drew up a blueprint for its operation.  The name was 
changed to Technocracy and incorporated under the laws of the 
state of New York as a non-sectarian, educational-research 
membership organization for the purpose of gathering more 
information and dispensing it.  The response was immediate and 
decisive; the people were ready for social change.
<p>
Then President Roosevelt introduced what was known as The National 
Recovery Act.  This legislation was going to give everyone a job 
through the sleight-of-hand of deficit spending, the idea being to 
create a sound economy by going into debt.
<p>
The result is now everywhere apparent: a debt burden which will 
never be repaid, unemployment, proliferating drug and alcohol 
problems, and children and older people in destitute situations.
<p>
Will the ecosystem of the planet stand the pressure of more of 
this treatment?  With a recovery plan blueprinted and ready to 
use, is it wise to refuse to use it?
