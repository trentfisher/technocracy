<p>
A new book <cite>Powershift</cite>, by Alvin Tofler, follows two other
books by the same author: <cite>Future Shock</cite> and
<cite>The Third Wave</cite>.  Tofler 
has the reputation of being a pretty fair reporter of the current 
social scene, and his book will be read by many who seek 
understanding and fail to find it.
<p>
Tofler draws a fairly accurate picture of some changes.  He sees 
that our society has changed from a "smokestack economy" to what 
he describes as one composed of a mosaic of more flexible means of 
production, from monolithic producers to smaller, more 
decentralized production establishments.  The impetus behind this 
change, as he sees it, derives from the improvements in 
communication.  Then he jumps from his observations to the 
conclusion that what we are evoloving toward is an economy where 
all the components of our adversarial relationships affect some 
sort of coalition, a refinement of democracy.
<p>
He leaves us there, still with questions unanswered concerning 
physical problems that threaten us.  Many people will read his 
book looking for answers to the growing problem of people like 
themselves who are trending toward becoming "outsiders", people 
with no place in North America except a dim future, perhaps a 
cardboard box to live in, with no credit card and with no effect 
on the course of events.  They need to know that there is a way 
out.  They need to know that a system is in place that can deal 
with the problems that they see as getting more threatening.
<p>
Tofler is a good example of the lengths intelligent people will go 
to in trying to rationalize what they see around them, but we all 
do it. Our brains work automatically to give us an understanding 
of our environment so that we can deal with it.  We have heard the 
story of the blind men feeling an elephant and describing what an 
elephant must be like.  The one touching the elephant's leg said 
an elephant is like a tree; the others reported that an elephant 
is like a -- snake or a wall, or somesuch.  At any rate, the 
lesson is that more facts were needed, especially, since the men 
were blind, they needed to conduct a more complete examination.
<p>
But sometimes humans can look, with good eyes and brains, directly 
at a thing and think they see something else.  The fallibility of 
witnesses in court cases is coming to be better understood, as are 
visions that are the product of fervent wishing.  However, here we 
have a different kind of blindness to describe -- call it "mind-
set", or "being locked in a concept."  Stubborness or 
bullheadedness won't describe it, nor will stupidity or perfidy.  
Perhaps, entertaining well intentioned, sincere but mistaken 
notions would be better.
<p>
The news is full of people crying out for "democracy" when they 
are starving.  They need food and better social organization, not 
an empty-of-substance myth like "democracy."  There is no proper 
substitute for correct information; people should know that there 
is no democracy anywhere -- nor can there be.  The word is part of 
the lexicon of political idealogy and is taken to mean release 
from oppression, from the constraint of politics.  And the 
constraint of politics is just what results from trying to 
practice what cannot be!
<p>
What Tofler apparently cannot see is that the steady growth and 
refinement of technology is leading toward a crisis, a crisis of 
choice between the foolish fumbling of political method and the 
institution of a techique of selecting excellence in leadership.  
Call it Technocracy if you will; the principle is well understood 
wherever physical concerns are dealt with successfully.
<p>
How can Tofler, or anyone else, sincerely believe that this 
society, rapidly becoming more complex and more technical, will be 
lucky enough to escape certain disaster if continuing with 
politicians directing what they cannot understand?  But he does 
this.  He concludes that political institutions must face radical 
change, but to what?  A better grade of idiocy?
<p>
The essence of Technocracy is cooperation.  The mechanics of how 
North Americans can be organized take advantage of this aspect of 
human nature is described in Technocracy's literature.  Tofler 
would have been better advised to have first studied the subject 
more thoroughly instead of recommending adventures in further 
foolishness.
