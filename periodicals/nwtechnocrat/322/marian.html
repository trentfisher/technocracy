<p>
Earth Day enthusiasts are one of many well-meaning minority 
groups; their special target is the "litter bug."
<p>
Other popular minority groups and their corresponding "foes" 
include:  feminists against masculine citizens, abortionists 
against anti-abortionists, blacks against whites, whites against 
hispanics, democrats against republicans, religionists against 
atheists, rich against poor.
<p>
Regardless of the minority to which you belong, your only chance 
to solve your problem is to support the interests of the majority, 
not merely your own minority.  And, more importantly, the majority 
to which you belong is the citizenry of the North American 
Continent.
<p>
Technocracy, alone, points out that the real problem is the Price 
System itself, which is adversely affecting all citizens of this 
Continent with its waste and inefficiency.
<p>
As a North American citizen, your home is this Continent.  Its 
problems are your problems.  You can only solve these problems 
as a majority cause, not a minority cause.  Air pollution, water 
shortage and pollution, technological unemployment, natural 
resource depletion, the slaughter of humans on the highways and 
many more problems are yours to help solve.  You are directly 
involved.
<p>
Technocracy's position always has been, regardless of color, 
creed, religion or national origin, that the people who live on 
this continent are entitled to share in the abundance of goods and 
services that technology is able to produce for every one of us.  
In Technocracy's view, no individual is "better" than another.  
Some have more training and capability, so, understandably, they 
will incur more responsibility.
<p>
No minority view can operate this Continent.  It's too big, too 
complex.  Only a social concept that comprehends the whole 
operation of North America and operates for all of us will 
function.  In this complicated society, shortsighted competing 
minorities may put the lights out.  Then, where are you, male, 
republican, rich or homeless?
