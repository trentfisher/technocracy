<p>
First we must clean up our own nest, is a message North Americans 
should carefully examine.  While we travel the world over telling 
other nations how to run their systems, ours is sinking ever 
deeper into the quicksand of economic chaos.  People seemingly do 
not feel that it is the system that is at fault, but feel instead 
that it is the abuses that are causing us problems.  It should be 
recognized that there exists a close connection between the basic 
system, a Price System, and the resulting abuses.  They blend into 
one and the same thing.  Serious study shows that our social 
problems are inherent in the use of money, which is the beginning 
and end of human affairs in any Price System.  It is correct to 
say that the social and economic impact of science and technology 
has rendered the Price System obsolete; the basic system has so 
changed that we are overwhelmed with all the problems.
<p>
The basic problem in the Price System is that science and 
technology have drastically changed the time rate of doing work.  
This problem will require major structural change and overhaul of 
the entire social system.  This has created other basic problems 
that are not being addressed because we still prefer philosophical 
speculation rather than face the facts about what is endangering 
our survival in North America.  The problems we face are the 
constrictions of money and the archaic method of politics.  
Applying yesterday's concepts to the realities of today and 
tomorrow is like building a modern skyscraper of sand and spit.  
We seem to be trying to continually prove that the political 
process can solve all our social problems.  We have an educational 
system that is teaching people to live in the past.  We promote a 
dead-end ideology here to place side by side with the others 
around the world that are also in deep trouble.
<p>
After over more than fifty years of scientific research, 
Technocracy Incorporated has made a Technological Social Design 
available to government and the public for an examination of the 
facts that show what must be done to avoid social chaos.
