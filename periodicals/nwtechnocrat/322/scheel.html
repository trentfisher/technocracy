In his bid for election, George Bush promised us that he would be 
our environmental president.  (He also promised us that he 
wouldn't raise taxes.)  So in the case of the old-growth/Spotted 
Owl controversy, we see our environmental president making 
decisions that are as unreliable as his promises.
<p>
He chose to ignore the facts when he came after the Northern 
Spotted Owl and its habitat.  If our president had done his 
homework -- if he ever does any homework --, he would realize that 
the Spotted Owl is not the issue here.  <strong>The issue is jobs over
extinction</strong>.  Humankind over extinction.  If our president and 
those worried over losing timber sales and those worried over 
losing their jobs have their way, in ten years time the Spotted 
Owl will be gone, the old-growth timber will be gone and so will 
the jobs.  So what would be gained?
<p>
Jack Ward Thomas, chief wildlife research biologist for the U.S. 
Forest Service's Northwest Forest Range and Experiment Station in 
La Grande, Oregon, is the highest-ranked wildlife research 
biologist in the National Forest System.  His committee of 16 
included 13 other biologists, among them most of the world's known 
experts on the Northern Spotted Owl.  Thomas led this team of 
scientists after being asked by F. Dale Robertson, chief of the 
Forest Service and a former supervisor of Oregon National Forests 
where spotted owls live, to lead the research team and take the 
issue "wherever the science leads you."
<p>
The Thomas strategy calls for dispersal zones between habitat 
conservation areas, the "50-11-40 rule."  That "rule" states that 
50 percent of the forest outside the habitat areas should be made 
up of trees with a diameter of 11 inches and 40 percent closed 
canopy.  This would close millions of acres of Northwest forests 
to logging.
<p>
In his April 10, 1990 journal entry, Jack Ward Thomas said:  "We 
are at a building watershed period in the history of conservation 
in North America.  It seems so strange that a small, cryptic owl 
should be a trigger and symbol to such a struggle.  Our little 
group of scientists will be the center of the storm -- lightening 
rods for controversy.... Where had the six months gone?  Six 
months in which I had been home only seven days.... Then came the 
chilling realization that now the consequences of our actions would 
descend upon us and follow us all the rest of our days.  We had 
done our job and done it well.  Yet, what we had done signified 
the end of an era, and with the end of that era would come 
economic dislocation and human suffering.  We were not responsible 
for that.... but we will take the blame."
<p>
Like other scientists before him, who dared to point out the 
truth, Thomas has already lost friends, people who wouldn't shake 
his hand when he returned to church in La Grande after being gone 
for six months on this extensive research.  Also, Thomas led the 
media into believing that he and his wife had no children, 
"anticipating the first wave of public hatred and animosity and 
wanting to spare them as much unpleasantness as possible."  And 
the Federal Bureau of Investigation has been looking into a 
variety of vague personal threats.  But whatever former friends 
believe, whatever happens to him personally, it won't, as Thomas 
points out, "change the science" of the situation.
<p>
Bill Munroe, an outdoors writer in the Portland Oregonian sports 
department, writes:  "While it has come to be called the Jack Ward 
Thomas report, it isn't Thomas threatening to take jobs away, 
wreck homes and crush the timber-based economy of an entire 
region.  Thomas is yoked by unforgiving science to the 
bureaucratic and political processes that may cause those 
traumatic social disasters predicted by politicians, corporations 
and the people it will affect.  His background uniformly leads him 
to deal in data, facts and the unrelenting surety that what 
science says will be -- ultimately is."
<p>
"Protecting old-growth timber to save the Spotted Owl isn't the 
only obstacle in the way of logging jobs.  Wilbur Wood, writing 
about natural resources for THE NATION magazine, says:  "Should we 
sacrifice even these slow-to-regenerate forests of the Northern 
Rockies for the sake of jobs?  The timber industry says yes, but 
when you consider how automated logging and milling have become 
these days, the jobs argument breaks down.  Giant timber companies 
like Champion and Plum Creek, Georgia Pacific and Weyerhaeuser, 
have moved well beyond ax and saw, well beyond horses pulling 
logs down a mountain.  Now they have robot-like machines that 
grasp and slice off trees like stalks of corn, along with huge 
mechanical grapplers and loaders.  Now, as well as big tractors 
that knock down trees and tear up the ground, timber companies 
deploy gigantic 'yarders,' which squat on ridgetops and send 
tentacles of steel down forested slopes; these steel cables, 
pulled slowly over the land, drag down everything in their path.
<p>
"Logging is still hard and dangerous work, but instead of hundreds 
of human beings working over one mountain slope -- and at least 
potentially able to select which trees to cut and which to save -- 
we have a few dozen people pushing buttons, hitching chains, 
marking butt ends to indicate whether the logs are from private or 
public land.  The more automated the logging, the fewer the jobs 
and the more devastated the land: denuded soils, streams silting 
up, trashed fisheries, piles of 'slash' (discarded limbs and 
branches, bushes and small trees) later to be torched, fewer 
living green things to take in carbon dioxide and breathe out 
oxygen, more and more ugliness..."  (Mr. Wood seems to blame the 
machines for creating environmental degradation and not the misuse of
machines.  There is a vast difference.)
<p>
In some areas of Oregon and Washington, helicopters lift the logs 
out of mountainous forests, upsetting some modern-day Luddites.  
Several years ago one of them punched out a National Geographic 
writer who was commissioned to get the facts regarding the logging 
industry in the Olympic National Forest near Port Angeles, 
Washington, for daring to bring up this controversial subject.  
"How do you feel about the helicopters?" asked the writer.  POW!  
Clearly the logging truck driver felt threatened by advancing 
technology.
<p>
In the case of the Spotted Owl versus old-growth trees, the 
loggers and timber companies feel threatened by scientific 
solutions in balancing nature.  A farmer's billboard in Chehalis, 
Washington reads:  "Support our loggers' right to keep their jobs; 
eat a Spotted Owl for lunch."  A restaurant just south of there 
sells soup cans that intimate "Campbell's Cream of Spotted Owl 
Soup."  Some lumber company employees are saying that the only 
good tree is a stump.  And you can be sure that every time that 
cute little fluffy owl is shown on TV, innocently blinking its 
eyes, the hackles on loggers' necks rise up and dance a jig.
<p>
Politicians try to straddle the political fence so as not to 
offend either industry or environmentalists, anything to save 
votes.  Virtually ignored in all this controversy is the Jack Ward 
Thomas factual report as environmentalists and politicians go out 
on a limb to find a way to save the Spotted Owl, log some patches 
of timber but save some and also save jobs, and our environmental 
president is shimmying up the same tree.
<p>
Over 50 years ago another man of science was vilified for daring 
to point out the truth.  The importance of the energy factor in 
social measurement was made by this scientist whose laboratory 
was a Continent.  Howard Scott and the team he led discovered that 
power machinery had become sufficiently efficient to produce more 
goods with less manpower and that we had reached the paradoxical 
situation where the more we could produce, the less we could 
consume.  So, if the sale of human hours could not provide 
sufficient purchasing power to buy lifes's necessities, it became 
evident that some other distributing method must be devised.
<p>
Technocracy's founder and his team, first known as the Technical 
Alliance, devised an energy accounting design that would use 
measurement instead of money (which is a measure of nothing) as a 
means to provide an equal distribution of goods and services to 
North American citizens as their birthright.  And since machines 
can do the work and do it better and faster, why do we continue to 
think we need a full-time job?  Work, even in 1929, could be 
divided up among all citizens with four-hour-days, four-day-weeks, 
167 days vacation a year and early retirement.  Perhaps in time 
those wonderful machines could cut the work time to two hours a 
day.  What is wrong with that?  For the first time we would have 
time to better ourselves by improving our creative skills.  But 
evidence seems to indicate that most people would rather go to 
their graves, living in the past, than embrace a new idea that 
just might let them learn how to live free and unencumbered by all 
the problems money creates.
<p>
It is interesting to note that Jack Ward Thomas was born two years 
after Technocracy Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the 
state of New York.  Although he has done a commendable job of 
research regarding the Spotted Owl/old-growth timber controversy, 
and although he laments <em>being blamed</em> for causing job dislocation, 
he has not, nor have any of his fellow scientists, touched on the 
concept of measurement in job and economic areas.  If measurement 
will work in conserving our valuable resources, why won't it work 
in other areas as well?
<p>
It is a sad commentary on the intelligence and initiative of the 
North American people that Technocracy's Energy Accounting design 
has been ready for implementation since 1933, yet our legislators, 
our technologists, and all the rest are still wondering what to do 
with our unemployed.
