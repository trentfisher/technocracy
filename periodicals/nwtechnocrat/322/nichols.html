Everyone likes a new idea if it proves to be significantly more 
efficient than previous methods.  However, if the new idea is not 
quite simple, or if it is not profitable, a considerable amount of 
proving may be required for it to be accepted.  There was a time 
when everyone thought the world was flat and the sun revolved 
around it.  Any expression of a contradictory belief was 
intolerable.  In the beginning of this century the driver of an 
automobile was considered a crackpot, or at best with amused 
tolerance.  It is an extremely rare phenomenon to find an 
individual who has the intelligence required to withhold judgement 
concerning a new idea until facts about its practicability have 
been obtained.  And it is even more rare that an individual may be 
found who can withhold judgement and is also willing to make some 
effort to investigate the facts involved.  The mental requirements 
are beyond the capability of many, and the intelligence required, 
the courage necessary to differ from popular prejudice is seldon 
found outside the field of science, and not often even there.
<p>
As technological change has occurred, slowly at first, then with 
ever-increasing speed, changes came so fast that, in spite of the 
traditional reluctance to accept change, humans have become more 
accustomed to it and therefore demonstrate less resistance to it 
except where major prejudice is present.  The increasing 
acceptance of change is fortunate indeed since this trend is 
preparing mankind for the far greater changes to come.  If one 
considers the changes in the means whereby we have lived during 
the past 100 years and the increasing speed with which those means 
have been presented, he should realize that fifty years hence life 
may be far different from anything known before.  And, if we are 
to survive, we must adapt ourselves to those changes.
<p>
Consider the present increase in population.  With oil, iron, 
lead, tin and many other non-recurring resources already 
approaching exhaustion, what will the living standard be with ten 
billion people in need of those resources?  If we lack the 
intelligence to limit population growth, nature will do it for us 
in a much more unpleasant manner.
<p>
Consider the ecological disaster ahead if we continue our present 
direction.  Landfills that leach poisons, incinerators that allow 
the worst poisons to disperse, ozone depletion, acid rain and a 
host of other environmental depredations result from the chase 
after the fast buck.
<p>
Consider the difficulty of using the political method in attempts 
to solve the highly complex technical problems of today.  Can 
anyone really believe this method can solve the problems existing 
50 years down the road?  A much more efficient method of social 
operations will be required if the human species is to survive.
<p>
Consider the economic system.  It is a system of trade and 
commerce based on commodity valuation which is determined by 
scarcity and financed by debt, a system which keeps millions of 
people living in poverty regardless of how much our technology can 
produce.  It takes lots of persistent disinformation to maintain 
the ignorance required to keep such a system in operation for even 
a little while; it is physically impossible to keep it going much 
longer.
<p>
Yes! There will be changes. Some of them will be greater in 
magnitude and in social significance than any before known in the 
entire history of man.  A demonstration of far more intelligence 
will be required than ever before.  Those who can understand the 
necessity for change must help those who can't.  Those who can 
overcome their own prejudice, realize their own need to increase 
their knowledge, and are willing to do something about increasing 
that knowledge must provide the leadership for tomorrow.  They 
must do so because no one else can.
<p>
We are heading into an entirely different kind of world.  The 
technological development of the North American Continent has only 
begun, and its use for the benefit of only a few cannot be 
continued.  The sheer volume of technologically produced goods and 
services with so few man-hours of human labor has already 
antiquated past and present methods of distribution, and North 
Americans have no choice but to allow themselves, including all 
the rest of North Americans, the benefit of this production of 
plenty.  It is a simple matter of survival.  We can't maintain the 
scarcity required to keep prices up, we can't afford the wars and 
debt necessary, and it is doubtful whether the belief that it's 
one's patriotic duty to die for the system can be maintained.
<p>
When one has fought and clawed his way to the top of the social 
heap, it is doubtful that he can ever allow himself to risk all he 
has gained, plus the advantage he has over others, to make a mad 
rush to change anything.  He is much more likely to refuse to 
admit that any other way of doing things is possible.  As a 
result, the leadership of tomorrow will likely not evolve from the 
leadership of today.  The people of this Continent may as well 
resign themselves to the present conditions that provide the 
incentive for crime, drugs, ecological deterioration and war, 
unless they become willing to take the profit out of such 
activities.  The profit cannot be removed within the framework of 
the present Price System of social operations, whether it leans to 
the right or to the left.  An entirely new method is required.  
That new method has been researched by Technocracy Inc. and its 
predecessor, The Technical Alliance, since 1918, a total of 70 
years.  When you have had enough of this Price System and its war, 
crime and pollution, with its poverty in the midst of plenty, then 
try an investigation of Technocracy's blueprint for a society 
scientifically designed for an age of intelligence.
