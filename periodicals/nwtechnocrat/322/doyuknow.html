...The S&L scandal has received a great deal of publicity, as well 
it should; the complicity reaches high into the echelons of 
government, and they are all scrambling to cover their tracks or 
at least downplay their responsibility.  In the meantime the 
general economic picture worsens.  The national debt is climbing, 
and the amount of this debt owed by every man, woman and child in 
the U.S.A. has grown from $3,989 in 1980 to $12,409 in 1990, a 
staggering increase of over 300%.  The federal deficit is now $300 
billion, and, to put this in perspective, if the entire amount 
allocated for defense ($289 billion) was eliminated, the budget 
would not balance.  As a result of poor economic performance many 
U.S. companies are cutting costs, and when companies cut costs 
that means layoffs.  Chase Manhattan Bank, the country's second 
largest, is terminating 5,000 employees.  McDonnell Douglas, the 
big defense contractor, is cutting 17,000 from its workforce.  
General Electric is laying off 500 of its workers from their plant 
in Louisville, Kentucky.  Compounding all of this is the situation 
in the Middle East.  Since that crisis erupted, the price of oil 
has nearly doubled; therefore, the monthly oil bill for the U.S.A. 
has risen accordingly.  This will have a marked effect on 
everything; prices will rise; the economy will weaken; more jobs 
will be lost.  A cold winter, coupled with rising prices for 
heating oil, will impose severe hardships for many people.
<p>
...The situation in Canada is probably worse: a huge deficit, 
major firms tending to relocate south of the border, the 
imposition of a Goods and Services tax of 7% January 1, 1991, 
Constitutional problems, and a very unpopular government -- all add 
up to a loss of confidence that does not augur well for the 
economy.  The Gross Domestic Product has been stalled since May, 
which makes it an "official" recession.  With the winter doldrums 
just beginning it could be a hard winter ahead, with no signs of 
any improvement.
<p>
...Every day, 40,000 children under the age of five die in 
developing countries.  Most of them could be saved; the problem is 
insufficient funds, not the inability of medical science.  The 
U.S.A. has a poor record when compared to other industrial nations 
in preventing childhood disease and injury.  25% of preschoolers 
and 33% of poor children under 5 are not immunized.  14% of 
children under 5 in the U.S.A. are considered to be malnourished, 
though they will no doubt survive many will suffer permanent 
damage to their health and their learning ability will impaired.  
It is not surprising therefore to find that 60% of the households 
that receive foodstamps contain children; the average amount 
received in constant dollars has not changed since 1980.  The 
number of pediatric AIDS cases in the U.S.A. is rising rapidly, 
particularly in poorer neighborhoods; it is estimated that by 
1991, 20,000 children may be infected.
<p>
...All of the above, and for that matter all of our present day 
social problems, are the direct result of attempting to maintain 
an obsolescent social system, a Price System.  All of these 
problems are directly attributable to the inefficiency of money as 
a means of social administration and to the inability of this 
system to care for the needs of people in a technological age.  We 
offer the following quote from the U.S. News & World Report of 
October 8, 1990:  "Everyone knows that the political system is 
broken, and it is increasingly clear that the only cure is a 
sledgehammer.  Removing the poison of money from politics must be 
the first step toward reform."  To this we add:  Why stop at 
politics?  Let us remove the poison of money from everything and 
install a government of function as advocated by Technocracy for 
over fifty years.
