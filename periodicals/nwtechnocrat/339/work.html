<hr>
Fifty years ago Howard Scott stated that American business was exporting the
tools of social change (Technology) all over the world. Jeremy Rifkin's book
<cite>The End of Work</cite> just published, is an excellent
description of what fifty years of Price System "freedom" has left in
the wake of the free-for-all quest for profits.
<p>
CHQ recommends this book to any one who is interested to learn what has
happened while the public was preoccupied with sports, TV trivia, political
wrangling and other such diversions while the "big boys" did their serious work
of looting, raping and generally cutting up the world for their own benefit.
<p>
Bribery, blackmail, coercion and intimidation were honed to a fine art.
Governments were suborned; officials were bought and sold; no holds barred in
the quest to make the world safe for free enterprise. They succeeded only too
well. The book, <cite>The End of Work</cite>
is a graphic example and expose of the
aftermath of a "success" in the Price System.  Mr. Rifkin does not put it quite
as badly as we have but he has described the results very well. The technology
installed all over the world, although not as complete as here in the U.S.,
still is enough to upset and shatter age-old traditions and the way of life
everywhere -- wherever there were resources to exploit.  Mr. Rifkin mentions
Technocracy in several chapters; his extensive bibliography includes references
to Technocracy Literature. Needless to say he does not treat Technocracy very
kindly, but then that is to be expected.  The march of events is proving
Technocracy all too correct, so it is to be expected that some "sour grapes"
will sprout.
<p>
Rifkin is not the only one who has suddenly become aware of  "something" being
terribly wrong with the way the world is drifting. Many newspapers and
periodicals carry articles and stories of the same theme, but Technocracy is
the only Organization that has called it for what it is -- Social Change -- and
has presented the only viable solution.
