It is impossible to scan the media today and not be aware of the importance
attached to the issues involving women's rights. Also well known as feminism,
equal opportunity, sexual equality and minority rights to name a few, the
outcome of the actions taken and the policies supported by these different
groups, is of considerable interest and importance to approximately half the
population of North America. One may ask why these groups are necessary in the
first place. Has their formation advanced the position of women in any
significant manner? More importantly, if it has, what are the prospects for
further progress?
<p>
The role of women in the history of the human raced is fairly well documented.
Aside from the minor deviations, the need for long term nurturing of the young
has been the principal force in determining the position assigned to women
throughout history. Even the change from the hunting and gathering to a more
stable agricultural society made no measurable difference, and the lack of any
significant change in the manner in which the needs of society were met through
the following centuries, allowed only minor variations in their
position.
<p>
The reinforcing of these assigned roles was further solidified by the
incorporation into the mores of society of a number of beliefs, prohibitions,
superstitions and laws.  The various religions also played their part in
ensuring that male dominance was the foundation on which the power structure
was based. It must also be kept in mind that male dominance was the foundation
which the power structure was based. It must also be kept in mind, that what
relief woman may have had from time to time, was restricted to those very few
that lived  at the top. What then, given the fact that there was no progress of
significance for women through the countless centuries, is now allowing  this
explosion in feminine activity? What is so different today compared with the
past?
<p>
Although superior in social position in every level of society for centuries,
humans, except for a privileged few, had not escaped the hardship and drudgery
of a low energy civilization. It was the industrial revolution that first
brought into play the use of energy other than human or animal in the
production of goods. It was this change in society, this application of other
sources of energy, that allowed humans their first real taste of the fruits of
their own labour.
<p>
The resulting distribution of goods, although inadequate and uneven, also
allowed for a somewhat modest increase in women's living standards as well.
However the power structure remained intact, and aside from certain occupations
reserved for women, such as nursing, teaching, and cleaning, women's lives
droned on as usual.
<p>
Except for a brief time during World War II, when the productive capabilities
of women were trumpeted from every radio and movie screen, little has changed.
But the legacy of wartime work did not go unnoticed. Women with more time
available started to look for additional sources of income and to pursue
interests other than those traditionally assigned to them. The massive entry of
women into the occupations traditionally assigned to men  was difficult, if not
impossible, and although some progress has been made, gender representation is
still typically unbalanced in man's favor.
<p>
The various women's groups that have been formed in the last 20 years or so,
have had a definite , even if some what limited on the progress of women in
society. They have brought to the forefront the need to address the issue of
mail dominance in all aspects of society, but have failed to achieve
significant progress in attempting  to combat the mores that have been built up
over centuries, they have found that sacred cows die hard.  witness the anti
feminist backlash  that has found support not only among men, but women as
well. Can we expect further process  - significant  progress - as a result of
the actions of these diverse groups of people  attempting to influence those
that have the most to lose? The answer to this lies in examining the
circumstances that exist today, for only in understanding the physical
realities that govern todays society, can we begin to see the direction women
must take if they are to achieve their position next to men as equal partners
in a changing world.
<p>
Today's world is one of declining recourses, environmental degradation,
exploding population, and what many consider to be the most important problem,
the lack of not only new employment opportunities, but the continuing
disappearance of those positions that gave rise to and maintaining the "middle
class", the heart of North American democratic society. this economic system,
dominated by its massive debt, is rapidly reaching the point of maximum
expansion. The division of "Wealth" in a static economic climate is
insufficient to support the type of social progress that is necessary if the
aspirations of women are to be met. Further, a declining or imploding economic
condition, will mean a retreat from present policies, as the social aspects of
government legislation are sacrificed in a vain attempt to maintain the status
quo by cutting spending. The division of this shrinking pie will have its most
immediate impact on those already existing on the outer edge of society. As a
result a significant number of women will be drastically effected by the
inability of this economic system or "price system", to deal with this
escalating problem. As the situation worsens, the pain will be shared among the
ever increasing segment  of the population until the level of social tolerance
is reached, and social change takes place.
<p>
The only logical choice for women is Technocracy. Technocracy's program of
equal distribution of the abundance available in North America today, its
replacement of money, or debt as it should really be known, with
non-transferable consuming rights issue to every man, woman, and child, will
usher in the final chapter in women's long struggle to attain equality. With
the economic stranglehold  finally broken, women will be free to follow their
own agenda, no longer dependent upon the whims of their mate. They will also be
free from the violence inflicted upon them by the necessity of maintaining
abusive relationships in order to keep body and soul together. And finally,
they will be free from inadequate remuneration of humbling occupations or the
meagre handouts resentfully given by an overtaxed public purse.
<p>
The time has passed for the tactical approaches of the various coalitions of
women's movements. Only by understanding that all of the problems that we face
today are totally interrelated, and that solve one, you must solve them all,
can we move ahead to the next step in social evolution. Investigate the only
organization that has designed a system of social operation that effectively
brings women into the mainstream of society. Only through a Technocracy can the
individual and collective intellect of women finally be released to attain its
full potential. Society has been denied this asset too long.
