Jobs, Jobs, Jobs, is the rallying cry of those unhappy people who have lost
their jobs, to strike is not the answer, except
temporarily and for a declining minority. Wherever possible, employers have
resorted to an end run and have installed labor-saving machinery. In fact, some
corporations have suffered business losses at the same time that improvements
in technology appeared. In several cases we know of, the CEO, Chief Executive
Officer, of such corporations were given ultimatums - either de-job thousands
of people - or be fired yourself.
<p>
"The End of Jobs", an article in FORTUNE magazine by William Bridges, starts by
pointing out the declining number of jobs. It then points out the type of
"work" people will be doing in the future. However, it doesn't point out that
the increased efficiency resulting from the new type of work methods, plus  the
continuing increase in efficiency of technology, equals an even more rapid
decline in the total work (the man hours) that will be needed as a basis for
distribution. So, therefore, purchasing power can no longer be distributed
sufficiently. The need is for the distribution of purchasing power to be a
reward for citizenship rather than as a reward for man hours of work, whether
that work is done as in the past or as it will be done in the future. These
points are not discussed in this article.
<p>
We have excerpted a few lines from the article in FORTUNE magazine that
describes well a phenomenon that is now taking place, that has ramifications
that are not seen, even by the people who study and write about what they are
looking at.
<p>
The modern world is on the verge of another huge leap in creativity and
productivity, but the job is not going to be a part of tomorrow's economic
reality.  There still is, and will always be, enormous amounts of work to do,
but it is not going to be contained in the familiar envelopes we call jobs. In
fact many organizations are today well along the path toward being
`de-jobbed.'
<p>
"The job is a social artifact, though it is so deeply embedded in our
consciousness that most of us have forgotten its artificiality or the fact that
most societies since the beginning of time have done just fine without jobs.
The job is an idea that emerged early in the 19th century to package the work
that needed doing in the growing factories and bureaucracies of the
industrializing nations. Before people had jobs, they worked just as hard but
on shifting clusters of tasks, in a variety of locations, on a schedule set by
the sun and the weather and the needs of the day. The modern job was a
startling new idea --  and to many, an unpleasant and perhaps socially
dangerous one. Critics claimed it was an unnatural and even inhuman way to
work. They believed most people wouldn't be able to live with its demands. It
is ironic that what started out as a controversial concept ended up becoming
the ultimate orthodoxy -- and that we're  hooked on jobs.
<p>
"Now the world of work is changing again: The conditions that created jobs 200
years ago -- mass production and large organization -- are disappearing.
Technology enables us to automate the production line, where all those job
holders used to do their repetitive tasks. Instead of long production runs
where the same thing has to be done again and again, we are increasingly
customizing production. Big firms, where most of the good jobs used to be, are
unbundling activities and farming them out to little firms, which have created
or taken over profitable niches. Public services are starting to be privatized,
and government bureaucracy, the ultimate bastion of job security, is being
thinned. With the disappearance of the conditions that created jobs, we are
losing the need to package work in that way. No wonder jobs are disappearing.
<p>
"The reason U.S. production has increased more than 40 times that of the
pretechnological age is not because humans worked 40 times as fast, or 40 times
as hard, or 40 times  as many hours. The simple fact is, we do produce over 40
times as much per capita as we did some 200 years ago. Humans work much less;
they work shorter hours and certainly not as hard as before. These conditions
are so obvious that they can't be disputed. To some it has been obvious for
over half a century that it was technology that made the difference.
This technological change has occurred in a comparatively short time and at an
accelerating rate. Knowing these things it should then be obvious that the
ability to produce would out-pace the ability to consume or the ability to
maintain prices, or both. And that sooner or later a new method of distribution
would be required, one which could operate with far more efficiency. These
events antiquate the whole system of trade and commerce on this Continent. We
have now reached the point at which these trends can no longer be denied. An
entirely new social method is required. The fact is, a major social change is
due, if not past due, and we had better prepare for it. An alternative method
of distribution must be made and Technocracy's technological Social Design is
the only one available.
