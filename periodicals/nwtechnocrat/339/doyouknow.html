...More than 60 years ago, Technocracy explained how technology would replace
humans in the production of goods and the supplying of services. it was pointed
out that, as more efficient technology became available, the use of
person-hours of labour would diminish; then problems of distributing goods and
supplying services would become more increasingly more difficult to accomplish.
When what Technocracy was talking about (see Hotel Pierre Address, 1st quarter,
1995 the Northwest Technocrat) the whole idea was labeled as ridiculous.
Machines make work was the cry; technology will create and open up many more
jobs.
<p>
But Technocracy persisted, pointing out that money as a medium of exchange was
no longer valid and would need to be replaced by a method of distribution based
on energy accounting. This was also sneered at as being impractical. "Money
could never be replaced," people said. "How would people work?" They completely
missed the point that eventually they wouldn't work -- not as they once did.
Now, however, a glimmer of realization is beginning to appear. Mention is being
made of energy- accounting as a distribution system that needs to be installed.
More and more we read and hear that people are being replaced my machines - and
that many of the unemployed will never work again. Concern is being expressed
as to the future well-being of our society; there is belated recognition that
the debt-spiral is out of control and that no amount of money is capable of
solving our horrendous social problems. Jeremy Rifkin, in his book.
<cite>The End Of Work</cite>
states the case clearly. But, except for a few inaccurate lines, he
gives no credit to Technocracy, who said it all so many years ago. Not only
did we point all this out, but we came up with a practical solution: something
Rifkin fails to do. But people weren't listening. Or if they did listen, it was
forgotten in the mindless attempt to prop up an obsolescent system. The
attempts by Technocracy to inform people have been largely ignored; as leaders
of the status quo, over the years, have assured everyone that all is well and
that the system was working as it should.
<p>
Now, the voices of alarm and warning are appearing from other sources than
Technocracy, and the lateness of the hour is being stressed by more and more
concerned citizens and groups. The one realization that has not yet come to
people is that the organization of Technocracy is still the only one to offer a
practical solution to the dilemma of modern day technology and its tendency to
replace human muscle.
<p>
...This mindless attempt to perpetuate a system that for all practical
purposes, should have been discarded years ago has and will continue to have
serious monetary problems. These,  however, can be easily remedied with a
change to a better social system.
<p>
Far more serious and less easily remedied is the enormous damage being done to
this planet, in the blind pursuit of money, jobs and profit. We are doing to
this planet what no bird would ever do to its nest. And if it continues, all
life forms, including us, will suffer the consequences. The rate of extinction
of species is greater now than at any time since dinosaurs. We should ask: How
long before it is our turn?
<p>
...The industrial countries account for only about 20% of the world's
population. They consume 86% of the worlds aluminum, 81% of the paper, 80% of
the worlds of iron and steel, and 76% of the timber. The developing countries,
notably China and India, now are attempting to emulate us and are using the
same wasteful procedures.
<p>
The world's population is expanding; resources are dwindling;  sources of water
are drying up; atmospheric pollution is worsening; soil is being eroded; trees
are being destroyed at an alarming rate and the climate is changing. In 1990,
the highest global average temperature was recorded. In 1991, the eruption of
Mount Pinatubo gave the world a brief respite from global warming. That
explosion sent vast amounts of sulfate aerosols into the upper atmosphere, that
quickly spread around the globe. Once there, the aerosols reflected a minute
amount of incoming sunlight back into space, but enough to exert a cooling
effect. by early 1994, almost all aerosols had settled out, clearing the way
for a resumption of the warming trend.
<p>
New temperature highs were soon forthcoming. A heat wave in central India
lasted several weeks with temperatures up to 46 degrees Celsius or 115 degrees
Fahrenheit. In the western U.S.A., hundreds of new records were set, creating
hot dry conditions that led to a near record number of forest fires. Japan had
the hottest summer on record. Other parts of the world  suffered through
similar high temperatures. Oceanic fisheries are being seriously depleted. Cod
stocks in the Atlantic have virtually disappeared; concern is being expressed
about the future of Pacific Salmon, and the United Nations Food and
Agricultural Organization recently reported that all 17 oceanic fisheries are
now being fished at or near capacity. So it goes on. Food, resources and
potable water, all are being depleted, and the very ability of the planet to
sustain life is being threatened.
<p>
...In spite of the mounting evidence, now freely available, and in spite of the
disastrous consequences of the insane pursuit of continuing expansion, the even
more insane pursuit of profit continues. The attempts to prop up a moribund
system, is leading to ever increasing problems. and is growing more serious and
complex almost daily. If we look around, we can see that evidence is mounting
that we can no longer depend upon a social system that effects its distribution
of goods and services by means of commodity valuation, employing any form of
debt token or money. It is time; it is well past time in fact, to organize our
society on functional lines, giving responsibility to those having the training
and knowledge to understand modern technology - its potential and its
limitations. Only this, coupled with an energy-accounting system to accurately
record production, inventory and distribution will suffice. Anything less will
lead to chaos, violence and eventual extinction.
