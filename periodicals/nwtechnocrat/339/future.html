On September 6, 1994 at the International Conference on Population and
Development in Cairo. Captain Jacques-Yves Cousteau said ``that from 900 A.D.
to 1900 A.D., population remained relatively stable. but during his single
lifetime population has tripled and has set a hyperbolic growth curve. New
facts show that world population will reach 9 to 10 Billion in the year 2035.''
There is no way that such a population can be sustained. Famines will become
more widespread before we reach such a level of population.<p>
<p>
Mr. Cousteau states ``That we in the West have reached our remarkable state of
well-being by systematically underpaying for resources we acquired from the
poor. This economic weapon born from the concept of market economy, has reduced
three quarters of the world to misery, hunger and even deadly thirst.'' Mr.
Cousteau visualizes a changed world of brotherhood and mutual respect during
the next thirty years if we start now. He also says, ``That by the year 2030,
the world's resources will be difficult to share. Their fullness can be
evaluated today, using the most sophisticated science and technology to obtain
the best yield from them while using our sense of justice to assure equitable
access.''
<p>
Despite Mr. Cousteau's apparent confusion in the preceding paragraph, saying
that we have been systematically underpaying for the resources and then to say
that we use our sense of justice to assure equitable access, is apparently a
contradiction. He then states that "Energy will be the money of the future,
determining the real value of goods instead of basing the economy on the desire
of artificially tempted customers.
<p>
Mr. Cousteau seems to have a dim realization that energy is somehow the key.
But because of Price System concepts that cloud his vision he doesn't see
clearly that maintaining any vestige of the Price system concepts will prevent
realization of the future that he visualizes with a solution to all current
problems: proper stewardship of the environment, population control through
education and proper use of technology for the benefit of people.
<p>
A completely new social structure in North America using energy as the base of
a new production and distribution system will provide what Mr. Cousteau
visualizes, but only with a complete break with the Price System.
