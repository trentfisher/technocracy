<p>
For centuries people have dreamed of an age of peace and plenty, an age
without crime, debt, hunger -- or war!  A great dream indeed, but how
could such a dream be actually achieved in a real world in which these
things are traditional and profitable?  If such an age became possible,
what would be its operating characteristics, and where is the human
intelligence required for its installation?  Who would be willing to
make an effort to understand the physical requirements, or to accept the
drastic changes necessary to turn this dream into reality?
<p>
The ideal, or desire, for peace and plenty is not enough, the physical
requirements must be considered; an operating mechanism for the
distribution of plenty must be designed.  And until it is, such an
age will remain just that, an ideal, or desire, without substance in
this real world of matter and energy.  The installation of such a
mechanism would require the greatest social change in recorded human
history.
<p>
If humans are ever to achieve such a great goal, they must first prepare
for it, not only in the physical characteristics required, but also with
the necessary mental concepts as well.  Could it be done with the
present state of human intelligence?  Unfortunately, that is extremely
doubtful.  About the only chance of overcoming society's present mental
blocks is the pressure resulting from a complete economic collapse and the
greatest economic depression ever known by the human species.  And, in
addition, it must occur before a point-of-no-return has been reached in
the environmental degradation now in progress.  When that point has been
reached an economy of plenty will be made impossible by the shortage of
natural resources left on this finite earth.
<p>
The first requirement for an age of peace and plenty will be to find a
method to produce plenty of everything required for everyone in the
area.  This, is in addition to the area concerned having the necessary
quantity and quality of natural resources to supply the population.  It
would require the intelligence to design, construct, and operate an
automatic, computer controlled technology, and to achieve this
conversion to a compatible social system.  The location for starting
such an age must be determined by the area which has the resources to
make it possible, the iron, aluminum, wood, etc.  Further the area must
not be overpopulated.  WOULD YOU BELIEVE THAT THIS NORTH AMERICAN
CONTINENT ALREADY HAS THE ABOVE REQUIREMENTS?
<p>
When the above conditions are made possible, it would then be necessary,
for the first time in history, to design an economic system which could
effect the distribution of this plenty to all the people in the area.
Since human muscles are not powerful enough to produce so much,
technology must do the job.  Methods must be found to allow more people
to work less and still have access to the plenty produced by technology.
The most important jobs for humans will be to design and control, to
maintain and direct, the computers that control the technology until
computers can be trained to do this also.
<p>
It is a major mental problem to understand that an abundance, like the
air we breathe, can't be distributed at a price.  Therefore an entirely
new economic system, a non-price, non-profit system will be required.
How could one expect this requirement to be accepted by the owners of
big corporations whose chief concern is profit?  It can't be expected!
How could it be acceptable to politicians whose campaign expenses are
paid by corporations, or their owners?  Did the producers of wagons and
buggies cheer the early success of the automobile?  Without a major
miracle, this greatest dream will not be easy to achieve.  Certainly it
would require more intelligence than has, so far, been demonstrated by
the human species.
<p>
In spite of all the difficulties, an entirely new social order is
clamoring at the gate with a new method of social organization --
that can provide an equitable method of distribution that will eliminate
the poverty, and near poverty, now existing in the midst of plenty on
this Continent -- one which will eliminate politics, financial and
business manipulations, debt, and all crime for profit.  This new method
is already in process and is demanding to be completed and admitted onto
the North American scene as a replacement for the present scarcity
methods and concepts of the past.  Technology is forcing this issue and
will make possible that age of peace and plenty that we humans have
dreamed about for centuries.  The factors that are making all this
possible are the same factors that are making it impossible to continue
the ancient methods of the past; methods that do not allow the
distribution of the plenty our technology can already produce.  If the
citizens of this Continent are to make these changes it will be because
there is no other alternative to avoid chaos and the probable extinction
of the human species.
<p>
It is, unfortunately, highly improbable that we would ever make it into
an intelligently operated society if there was any other choice.  Even
so, it has been postponed for more than a half century.  People were
taught to believe in this system of scarcity, that it was the best, the
only system possible, that our country and the system are one and the
same thing and that we should be patriotic to it.  So, it is likely that
the pressure of events must drag many, kicking and screaming, into a
future actually so much better that it is without comparison.
Furthermore, it is most unlikely that those people will be able to
recognize the new society as being the one proposed by Technocracy Inc.
for the past 60 years.
<p>
The greatest changes in social operations in recorded history have been
in process for more than two centuries.  The technological development
during this time has rendered all scarcity concepts of the past
ineffective, antiquated and unworkable; the developing technological
ability reached the point of being able to produce a plenty about 1920,
but the inability of our ancient Price System to distribute this plenty
has condemned millions of this Continent's citizens to a life of poverty
and near poverty ever since.  It has caused the deliberate destruction
of food at the same time people were hungry.  Its maintenance has
required the greatest amplification of the debt structure of all time,
far greater than in 1929.  How could these things be tolerated? -- By
a concerted program of maintaining ignorance!
<p>
Without a drastic change from the mental concepts that support the
abominable scarcity methods of the past -- new concepts developed which
are compatible with and able to control a technological society in a far
more efficient manner, poverty will continue to increase at an ever more
rapid rate in spite of the increasing ability to produce.  The waste
required to maintain a scarcity economy will continue to increase at the
same time that it becomes ever more obvious that the continued waste of
the earth's natural resources will render this planet uninhabitable.
With 5.8 billion-plus people, the earth can no longer afford a waste of
its resources in the production of inferior products to increase sales
and profits.  Shipping abroad resources to assist in increasing the
overpopulation already existing in many areas can no longer be
tolerated, nor can an economic system which rewards such waste.
<p>
Technocracy Inc. has been trying to inform the citizens of this
Continent concerning these trends for the past 60 years, including the
environmental warning "The Ecology of Man", published in 1948.
Technocracy has had little assistance and much opposition from the Price
System leadership and its press.  Nevertheless, these trends continue as
predicted and the only solution remains Technocracy's Technological
Social Design.  Further, these trends are developing to the danger point
and any continued attempt to maintain public ignorance of these facts
must be considered social treason.
<p>
Unfortunately, the political leadership is so confused and stupid that
they believe they can balance the budget by decreasing the $130 billion
in yearly public assistance for the poor without decreasing the $448
billion in welfare for the rich.  Many strange behavior patterns may be
expected as this system of price continues its deterioration.  A
technological society is entirely too complex to be administered by the
political methods of any political party regardless of its position from
right to left.  One shouldn't be surprised to observe an increasing
number of citizens who are less confident in the political leadership.
As society becomes more complex, political mistakes become more obvious
and dangerous.
<p>
North Americans have been taught many things, for example, that they
should have political equality.  They have NOT been taught that they
should, or could, have economic equality, or that an economy of scarcity
can never tolerate the distribution of plenty regardless of the ability
to produce.  They haven't been taught that an abundance can't be
distributed at a price, or that North America has the technology, the
resources and the trained technologists required to produce plenty for
every citizen on this continent.  They haven't been taught what the
physical requirements are for an economy of plenty.  And, in fact, they
haven't been taught to understand the economic system in which they have
lived all their lives.  What more can one expect from educational
institutions that are politically controlled?  The citizens of this
Continent need to know these things, their survival depends on it.
<p>
The whole financial "system" is a system of debt.  Debt is a promise to
pay.  The total national debt is more than $20 trillion and increasing
at a trillion per year.  The federal debt alone is $5.1 trillion (1996).
To whom is this debt owed?  No one, it is an illusion!
<p>
Distribution is affected (more or less) by a system of trade, or
commerce, based on COMMODITY VALUES that are determined by the relative
scarcity and desirability of the commodity involved.  And, for the sake
of convenience, money, a token of debt is used.  This is a system made
entirely by man sometime in the distant past, and which can be changed
anytime we have the intelligence to do so.
<p>
There is no physical law that requires one horse to be in debt to another
horse.  And there is no physical law that requires one human to be in debt
to another human.  This whole thing is an illusionary mess that grew
haphazardly through the centuries from the old barter system devised by
the most cunning before recorded history.  Such unmeasurable methods are
not efficient enough, and are far too restrictive to affect the
distribution of the plenty modern technology can produce.  If the people
of this Continent are ever to expect an intelligent distribution of the
production, they must do far better than this.
<p>
The plenty everyone wants, the plenty our technology can already
produce, must be distributed to this Continent's citizens WITHOUT PRICE.
That is the only way it can be done.  Some may think they don't like the
idea of a non-price system.  Some didn't like the automobile, the
telephone, or the computer, but they are here just the same.  Progress
has a way of continuing whether some like it or not.  An economy of
plenty is the next major step in human progress, and any old antiquated
method (such as politics) that interferes will be rejected when that
interference is understood.  Political nonsense is just not good enough
to survive, since it cannot control technology.  It wasn't good enough to
build the greatest technological mechanism on earth right here on this
continent, and it is not good enough to balance production with
consumption, or conserve the earth's natural resources so that human
survival can be made possible.  These things require a scientific
solution, and a non-price system is it.
<p>
So, an entirely new type of social system is required, one that, for
the first time in history, is intelligently designed.  One that will
engineer out stupid nonsense such as poverty when plenty can be
provided.  A waste of the resources is not required to encourage people
to cooperate rather than compete.  The march of technological events,
population growth and environmental deterioration are demanding better
methods of social and economic operations.  People are already beginning
to demand that the problems of joblessness, homelessness, poverty and
crime be solved, but they can't be solved under the dictates of a system
based on scarcity.  They can only be solved be demanding an entirely new
social order.  Anything less is only an exercise in futility.
<p>
The only scientifically designed social mechanism is that designed by
Technocracy Inc.  Technocracy's Technological Social Design is the only
one available or likely to become available.  No one is asking anyone
to believe in it, we only ask that it be carefully investigated to
determine its correctness, as any intelligent person would do before
reaching a conclusion.
