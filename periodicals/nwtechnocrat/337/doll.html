<p>
Did you ever notice that the crew members of the starship Enterprise
have no wallet bulges, no purses to lug around?  Space-age technology
and phasers on stun may seem far removed from old growth forests and
Florida scrub jays, but in a steadily deteriorating world, often traded
off for financial expediency, the moneyless scenarios Trekkies and
science fiction prognosticators portray may not be flights of fancy
for some future date, but an immediate must for survival of life forms
on the Blue Planet (Earth).
<p>
The evidences are compelling.  Devastation for dollars takes on ominous
proportions.  Roman ringmasters decimated territorial animal populations
for theater games.  Today's technologies have us doing it globally
to propitiate the god of accumulating purchasing power.  Entrepreneurs
peddle everything from saguaro cactuses to soup made from tiger's
sex organs.  Rats devour crops in Southeast Asia, because the snakes
have been sold for their skins.  To pay their debts, nations savage
resources from their own populations.  The simple Mayans of Guatemala,
who got along fine for hundreds of years without money, have sold
off their heritage to vacation-home developers, leaving them landless
and destitute, dependent on the droppings of quirksome turistas.
<p>
How did we arrive at such a state that even efforts to save the planet
must await the requisite of money?  How has the economic social mechanism
we use to distribute the products of the earth become so removed from
the physical nature of the earth?
<p>
Once we lived more with nature.  Then as crop cultivation enabled
humans to produce more than immediately needed, human enterprise became
too cumbersome for simple barter.  A medium, money, was selected,
desirable because of its scarcity.  The medium wasn't the tangible
goods being distributed, but it was something one could touch and
feel.  Each progressive change in the financial mechanism -- from
tangibles to paper tokens to plastic credit -- has further removed
the money system from the physical world.  The mechanism is now based
on confidence in the capability of the medium to compound upon itself.  Debt
fueling the fires of consumption, is created at a computer keyboard.  This
expansionist quality of money runs directly counter to earth's
processes.  While
no one would consider a bank account that doesn't draw interest, we
adhere to a paradigm (a pattern or example) of growth and consumption
that is no longer appropriate.
<p>
Technology, driven by a synthesized reward system, has prompted a
steady withdrawal from awareness of the source of our physical
existence.  Radical
changes in the time-rate of converting energy have effectively decoupled
us from the rhythms of the natural world.  The fate of resources that
took eons to develop is being negotiated at speeds now measured in
quadrillionths of a second.
<p>
The magic of buy-now, pay-later has accelerated consumption far beyond
pay-as-you-go budgets.  Lotteries and big-win sweepstakes promise
to condense lifetimes of purchasing power into one big grab.  Retailers
clear land to erect huge buildings and parking lots to hawk their
wares, then close up shop and do it again a couple of miles away to
engage in "competition" with another retailer offering the same merchandise
across the street.  Duplications, redundancy and waste abound.
<p>
In our arrogant disassociation from our roots, nature is ignored,
not cohabited with.  The language that speaks to the economic human
in seductive terms of revenue generated speaks not of the sedate silence
of the redwood forest, but of the picnic tables and lawn furniture
to be drawn from it.  If it can't be sold, what good is it?
<p>
<h3>A New Way Of Thinking</h3>
<p>
The imperative of planetary survival calls for
the human species to adopt a new way of thinking that requires a careful
stewardship of nature that we have denied being a part of.
<p>
Modern suggestions for redefining economics in physical terms go back
at least to the thirties, when a social movement known as Technocracy
proposed replacing money with an energy accounting system, that would
guarantee every citizen an equal share of a bountiful, but resource-
conscious, production.  This was not mere Depression-era whimsy.  It
followed an exhaustive fourteen-year study of the resource and industrial
potential of North America.  This new social design had the potential
of lifting the nation out of the Depression and husbanding resources
for future generations.  But the pressures of reactionary influences
were too powerful, so, opting for status quo-saving measures like
New Deals and wars, FDR and big business rejected it.
<p>
But how about compromise?  In 1978, the accounting firm of Seidman
and Seidman advised its clients to adopt a dual accounting system
in both money and BTU's.  Like the Technocrats' proposal, it never
became public policy.  It's too hard to fudge with measurable quantities,
too easy with hoardable currency.
<p>
Another attempt at compromise was the most recent foray into tangible
accounting, the BTU tax measure, but this too was foiled by pressure
from the American Energy Alliance, an oil-fired "grass roots" movement
of some 2000 small businesses who eagerly lapped up all Big Oil had
to say about job losses if the tax went through.
<p>
While nature's laws are immutable, social systems are not.  They must
change with the conditions or the system dies.  If debt overload does
not force the issue (budgetary shortfalls already account for many
doable things left undone), nature surely will.  We will then have
a return to reality forced on us.
<p>
How may the transition be made?  How will we literally turn our thinking
from dollars to doughnuts?
<p>
It is happening, however haltingly.  The Clinton administration's
proposed biodiversity survey is one step.  It will surely be watered
down by parochial and political deal-cutting, but it is a step.
<p>
Sparked by the oil crunch of the Seventies, energy management is now
a growth industry, the thrust being energy not used is dollars saved.  It
doesn't always apply, however, or even work, particularly in the all-
you-can-eat, volume-pricing marketry that is the apotheosis of affordability.
<p>
For example, at a recent summer convocation of energy engineers held
in a convention center in Atlanta, participants remarked at the frigid
temperature in the huge building.  The reason: a ratcheting rate structure
that charges high-volume users less per kilowatt hour.  This "the
more you buy, the more you save" philosophy -- the incentive to shop
'til one drops -- permeates every phase of our economic structure.  This
is an absolute failure of conventional economics to conserve resources.
<p>
<h3>A Radical Change</h3>
<p>
Converting to a resource-based economy will require
a monumental change in our thinking.  In the new, resource-oriented
system, concern with durability, not return sales of shoddy goods,
will be the economic paradigm.  Maximization of benefit with MINIMUM
IMPACT ON NATURAL SYSTEMS will be the criteria for all human enterprise
-- not more bang for the buck, but more utility from the erg.  In
a resource-based economy, old value systems based on material reward
for investment of time and capital will give way to a new incentive
of achievement.  Even the vaunted job as a source of income becomes
an anachronism, particularly the paradox of rewarding people for consuming
resources in needless, redundant production with tokens to consume
more resources.  From a resource standpoint, we'd be far better off
paying people to stay home.
<p>
Tree huggers and technologists will have to come to terms on a common
direction.  Earth scientists will not be mere hirelings to bottom-line,
business-run government.  They will be the government, the shapers
of policy.  Everything will be recycled, from concrete to plate scrapings
for the generation of gases to be used for fuel.
<p>
With automated production directed toward efficient use rather than
showy sale, the human work load will be restructured to reduced work
schedules.  A uniformly high standard of living will require incomes
in the form of energy credits, to all, without regard to interpretations
of contribution, or moral judgments, but as a basic human right.  Obviously,
everyone can't have everything.  This does not mean that people can't
have access to everything we can produce.  We don't have to dispense
with the comforts we now enjoy, rather, we must develop and apportion
them with an eye toward a measured abundance.  Free access, not mortgaged
acquisition, is the new consumerism.  To anyone who has ever rented
a car or used a public library or park, it shouldn't be hard to adjust
to.  The main difference would be that the car rental would be in
the form of a charge against one's energy account -- a bookkeeping
chore, not an interference or a prohibition.
<p>
The social and environmental ramifications will be enormous.  No longer
will any living thing, human or otherwise, be relegated to the status
of a cash crop.  Not a single tree will be cut, a single river dammed,
a single building, automobile, or missile produced for the sake of
sales or job creation.
<p>
Cities, housing, transportation, production of goods -- all will be
restructured to synch with natural constraints, not with the demands
of motivation for material gain.  Technology will no longer be an
instrument of human domination, but of management.  Computers now
used to monitor the flow of debt and one-up-manship will be turned
to monitoring the flow of energy and resources.  Consumption will
be instantly recorded, and production set accordingly, eliminating
the need for excessive warehousing.  Instead of monitoring people,
devices will keep electronic fingers on the earth's pulse.
<p>
Ironically, the same labor-saving technologies that led to the rise
of the monetary system may well consign it to oblivion.  Technological
abundance will drive prices down while technological production eliminates
wage earners and taxpayers.  It's chancy, though.  There is the very
real danger that accelerated resource depletion will leave us with
a great deal of manufactured money but little to spend it on.
<p>
Even now, free trade agreements to enable debtor nations to satisfy
their creditors, portend environmental chaos.  The Great Global Swap
Meet promises to open new vistas of plunder, both in resources drawn
to produce trade goods and in the energy it will take to transport
redundancy around the globe.
<p>
If the practices that now prevail in market economics does not leave
vast populations warring over dwindling resources, it is probable
that with a heightened awareness of our oneness with nature, a corresponding
awareness of fellowship with others of the same species will follow.  With
an objective and impartial system for distributing the products of
nature, we would not be so prone to regard others, human or otherwise,
as threats to our own economic well-being.  No longer would we behave
as competitive predators, but as mutual guardians.
<p>
Whatever the form social institutions take, measuring, developing
and distributing the products of the earth with concern for social
consequences merits consideration right now.  The reclamation and
stewardship of the earth must no longer be subjected to the delaying
tactics of reward-oriented market economics, but directed to the higher
goal of common survival.
<p>
Perhaps, if and when we arrive at some future date, scholars of a
post- monetary era will view our lumbering garbage trucks and sprawling
population centers much as we view stone axes and chamber pots.  Even
more amazing to them, probably, will be how we survived so long trading
off our real wealth -- our natural heritage -- in diehard subjection
to something as insubstantial as the flow of imaginary I.O.U.'s.
