How many North Americans have seriously asked themselves or their
leaders why we should have poverty in the midst of plenty?  If we can
produce plenty, why should we have poverty?  Why do we destroy our
abundance to keep prices up, and if so many people are not needed in the
workforce, why should anyone have to work so hard?  North Americans need
answers to these questions, and there is no school anywhere in the
country that teaches students to understand these things.
<p>
The graduating classes from today's institutions of higher learning are
entering the most depressed economic conditions since the "great"
depression of the 1930s.  In addition, many are in debt by thousands of
dollars that they borrowed to finance their education.  The days when
a student could "work" his way through college have all but disappeared
since tuition fees have dramatically increased along with the cost of
living.
<p>
Universities have failed to provide their students with the information
required to solve economic problems.  With all the talk about political
democracy, freedom of speech and human rights, it would seem that
someone should suggest economic democracy, economic equality and freedom
from poverty.
<p>
Traditional beliefs haven't solved these problems, therefore
untraditional thinking is required.  It should be obvious that the
welfare of the country and its people is more important than traditions.
<p>
If the problems of poverty are solved, as a consequence many other very
important problems will be solved also.  We have poverty either because
we are not doing something correctly, or there is something we are doing
that is incorrect.  Shouldn't that be obvious?  So -- which is it?
<p>
Since we can produce plenty, the problem isn't in the production
process.  Then the only place it could be is in distribution.  How do we
effect the distribution of goods and services at the present time?
After living with it all our lives, we certainly should be able to
answer that.  How many can?
<p>
We effect the distribution of goods and services by a system of trade
or commerce, based on commodity valuation.  Some buy as cheaply as
possible and sell for as much as they can get.  So, what is wrong with
that?  If we look up the word "value" in Encyclopedia Americana, we find
that for any commodity to have value, it must not only be desirable, it
must also be scarce.  Well, nothing can be scarce if we produce plenty
of it, unless we destroy some if it to keep it scarce.  Any commodity
that is plentiful, including the air we breathe, is not scarce and
therefore has no value in trade.  It can't be bought and sold for a
price with or without a profit.
<p>
This little bit of information explains why our whole system of trade
and commerce cannot operate in a condition of abundance.  Further, it
explains why we have poverty in the U.S. and Canada.  It explains why
farmers have been paid to produce less and farm products destroyed to
keep prices up.  It explains why we destroy vast quantities of non-
replaceable natural resources and pollute the only environment in which
we can live.  It explains the production of shoddy products, products
made shoddy so that they will wear out quickly and need replacing to
increase sales and profits.  It explains why we can't eliminate crime
unless we remove the profits made from it.
<p>
If we can't see those things, even when they have become so obvious,
then we can't solve the major problems that exist as a result of North
America's enormous ability to produce with the most advanced technology
the world has ever known.  If we can't change our way of thinking from
the scarcity concepts of all past history, then it will be impossible to
take the next most probable step in human progress.  If we can't
overcome our own misconceptions about the world in which we live, the
problems resulting will continue to accelerate.  The debt, unemployment,
ill health, crime, riots, wars and an exploding population will render
this planet uninhabitable.  It will then be too late to be sorry.  If
anything useful is done, it must be done before a state of chaos has been
reached.  We must change our way of thinking and consider more effective
methods.
<p>
As Albert Einstein once said, "Now everything has changed except our
manner of thinking.  If we don't change, mankind will suffer an
incalculable catastrophe."
<p>
We hunt for ways to provide jobs, jobs, and more jobs.  We should be
examining the economic system itself to determine why so many jobs no
longer exist, and why they should be needed in this technological
society in the first place.
<p>
We have entered a period of increasing social dissatisfaction made
notable by its violence and crime.  Unemployment and underemployment
increase the social dissatisfaction still further.  These are conditions
which precede a major social change.
<p>
Our society has yet to demonstrate the intelligence required to change
social operations as they are needed.  We still require the pressure of
increasing social distress to provide the incentive.  We allow social
leadership to be provided by the very people who need social change the
least.  As a result there is much suffering by those on the bottom of
the heap, and a real threat of rebellion is often resorted to preceding
any important social change.
<p>
The educational process, including schools, news media, political and
business leaders, have failed to provide North Americans with the
information required to solve the problems of poverty. That is entirely
too obvious to be questioned.  The 1929 breakdown and the following
economic distress of the 1930s should have been warning enough.  Since
then the "recessions", the increasing debt, the declining jobs in
industry and social unrest, should have been enough for any intelligent
leadership to be totally convinced that the economic system was in need
of major changes or a complete redesign.
<p>
What is an economic system?  No economic system exists in nature; none
of the earth's animals have found it necessary to use one.  Only man has
designed a plan, or method, to "simplify" the distribution process.
What man has designed, he can redesign, if and when he has the
intelligence to do so.
<p>
When an economic system is so designed that its chief motivating
characteristic is greed, one must expect greed.  This must be the same
regardless of who is in power, or who owns the earth, or who is trying to
become its owner.  If the only method for becoming wealthy is at the
expense of others, then those with a talent for theft will take more
than their "fair" share.  Society follows the rules of the social
system, and encourages politicians to do the same.  Everyone, even
scientists must live according to society's rules.  So why blame any
individual, or group, for conforming.
<p>
Our society has become entirely too complex, too technical, to be
efficiently operated by political methods.  Isn't that obvious?
Unfortunately, the only people who have the training to operate a highly
technical society are the technical people who developed it, scientists,
engineers, technologists.  And even they can't operate a high-energy,
highly technical society by a set of rules which were handed down from
the dark ages.
<p>
Only an entirely new set of rules, an entirely new economic system
designed for a modern technological age, will suffice.  Since it must
control the world's most sophisticated technological mechanism, it must
have the direction of the most highly trained technologists available.
What other choice do we have except chaos?
<p>
For the past sixty years there has been a scientifically designed
economic system ready for use when the present system can no longer
operate -- and when North Americans become willing to investigate it.
That scientific design is Technocracy.   May we have the intelligence
to realize that it is necessary while there is still time.
