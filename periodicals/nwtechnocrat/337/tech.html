Technocracy is without a like or equal on the face of the globe.  It
may be defined as the application of science to the social order.  A
moment's thought will reveal the fact that no other system of social
control in all history has applied science to the problems of society
in any land.  Politics is not science.  Hence, Technocracy cannot
be compared to politics of any kind.  They are basically dissimilar.  Politics
approaches social problems from the standpoint of the opinions of
men, while Technocracy proceeds from the basis of known facts.  The
former is uncertain in the extreme; the latter is as certain as science
itself.
<p>
Every thinking North American today realizes that all is not well.  Those
same North Americans also realize that something must be done to correct
the increasing difficulties, but they are not in agreement as to what
should be done or how.  Here confusion enters the picture, and politics
only adds to the bewilderment by its everlasting outpour of words,
words, words, and its accomplishment of nothing concrete towards the
correct solution of our most pressing problems.
<p>
<EM>BUSINESS ON RELIEF</EM> Now, suppose we take note of some rather
upsetting facts (that is, upsetting to the idea of good government
as entertained by the average North American), and see if we can arrive
at some definite and helpful conclusions, thereby clearing the air
so that we can begin to see the actual picture instead of the mirage.
<p>
Did it ever occur to you that business has not been able to support
itself since 1929?  Stop spending and see how long business could
last.  In the early years of the "Great Depression" the cry went up
over the length and breadth of the land "Balance the Budget!"  Then,
in 1937, when the government (due to tremendous pressure from business)
tried to curtail relief expenditures, business took a nose-dive, and
in four months reached a "low" that it took twenty months to reach
after the 1929 crash.  Do you realize that today, every bank, every
corporation, every man, woman and child in North America is on relief?  Again,
stop spending and how long would any of us last?  Suppose your income
were cut off at this hour, how long could you last on your savings?  Thirty,
sixty, ninety days?  Whatever it might be, do you realize that you
are just that close to starvation?  A nice kettle of fish we are in
today, don't you think?  Not much social control in such a picture,
is there?
<p>
Now, let us make another observation.  Politics has had years in which
to find the solution to our pressing social problems, and it is more
confounded today than ever before.  If politics can solve the problem,
yet has not brought forth the solution, or, if it simply does not
know the answer, then, you must agree that it is incompetent to serve
this Continent in this mounting crisis.  Add to this the fact that
neither business nor finance has been able to bring forth a solution.
<p>
<EM>APPLYING SCIENCE</EM> Here is where Technocracy steps into the picture
and points the way.  Our attention is directed to the fact that due
to the unprecedented increase in our technology, we are now capable
of producing more than we can possibly consume.  Science has made
this possible, not business nor politics.  Business and politics may
interfere with its arrival for a while, but stop it they cannot!
<p>
<EM>WE CAN PRODUCE</EM> Automaticity has been developed to such a stage
that millions of jobs no longer exist, and this trend will continue
until the limits of social tolerance have been reached.  This accounts
for the unemployment problem already looming on the horizon.
<p>
So here we are, in this wealthiest land on the globe, capable of producing
an abundance for all, but without a system to distribute that abundance.  That
is what makes Technocracy's plan unique.  Technocracy is the application
of the knowledge of science and the methods of technology to social
management.  Among other things, it has been determined that since
a technological method of production is in use a technological method
of distribution must accompany it.  This, too, is unique.  It has
never been done before.
