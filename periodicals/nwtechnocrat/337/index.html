<h1>The Northwest Technocrat, 4th quarter 1994, No. 337, Vol. 56</h1>

<blockquote>
In the passing of the old and the instituting of the
new, human conflict will become the bitterest in history. Science
is hated and feared by ecclesiastical institutionalism, by corporate
enterprise and political parties. The fear and hatred that will be
directed by these against science and its technological application
will be far greater than those the Inquisition hurled against all
the accumulated heresies. Only science and its technological application
to the means whereby we live can produce for mankind the control of
our social destiny here on this earth. -- Howard Scott
