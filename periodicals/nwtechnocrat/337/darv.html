...The unemployed, politicians preaching make-work programs, and others
suggesting this method of solving social ills, should read, learn, and
carefully digest the following.  K Mart recently added 50,000 barcode
scanners to their system, at a cost of some $300 million.  This cut the
time cashiers needed to record sales by 25%.  Information from this
scanner goes through a local area network to a computer in the back of
the store that keeps track of sales and inventory.  Nine times a day,
the computer sends the latest data to the company's Troy, Michigan Head
Office via a private satellite.  The next morning, K Mart buyers from
any part of the country can view national sales data from the day
before.

American Airlines has a vast database of airline schedules, fares, hotel
rooms, rental cars, and the expertise to use this information to its
best advantage.  Its Sabre reservation system is used by 26,000
subscribers in 70 countries to handle more than 500,000 passenger
records every day.  American Airlines' computer system also performs the
crucial task of scheduling flights.  When a flight is adjusted, changes
ripple through the system to make sure crews, food and other related
elements are synchronized.  In the first quarter of this year, the
company's airline operations lost money, but the Information
Technologies Group posted a $103 million profit.  More North Americans
than ever are performing transactions without the actual use of cash --
coinless toll booths, bank machines, riding token-less subways, and
paying for everything from taxi rides to mortgages, with the swipe of a
card or the blip of an electronic transfer.  Such transactions accounted
for 18% of the $55 trillion total that U.S. consumers, corporation and
governments spent last year.  The number of electronic transfers has
increased nearly 200% since 1986 in contrast to a 17% rise in the number
of check and cash transactions.  The volume of household bills paid
through automated systems has doubled since 1991 to 800 million last
year.  20% of utility bills, 16% of auto loans, and 17% of mortgage
installments are now paid electronically.  Where have all the people
gone?  If collectively, we had the intelligence to take this to its
logical conclusion, a truly cashless society, with a distribution and
inventory system based on energy accounting, we would then be a long way
towards solving our many and complex social problems.  Jobs are going
the way of the dodo bird, and so are we if we don't soon recognize the
root cause of our problem.  Technocracy's design outlines a distribution
system based on energy accounting.

...As you often sit in your car behind hundreds of others waiting to
move a few more feet, have you ever wondered what it is you may be
breathing?  Each year the average car spews out: 60 kg of nitrogen
oxides, 35 kg of hydrocarbons, 4,064 kg of carbon dioxides.  And that's
when they are well tuned.
<p>
...In October 1993 the American Public Health Association unanimously
passed a resolution urging American industry to stop using the chemical
chlorine.  We don't understand all the mechanisms by which chlorine is
harming ecosystems, wildlife, and humans.  But, from what is known, it
seems clear that if we wait for conclusive scientific proof, the
destruction, which is already vast, may well become irreversible.
<p>
The International Joint Commission on the Great Lakes, has called toxic
contamination the most critical and urgent problem facing the lakes.
Despite a $5 million chemical industry campaign, a new report criticizes
both U.S. and Canadian governments, calling for a phase-out of the
production and use of chlorine-based compounds and many other chemicals
and proposes a prohibition on waste incineration.
<p>
...Coming to a supermarket near you in the not too distant future:  A
store chain in Holland has installed a system whereby shoppers scan
every item they put into their basket as they go along.  The total bill
is deducted automatically from the customers account.  NO CHECKOUTS!
<p>
...Next time some politician, or some equally deranged person talks of
JOBS, JOBS, JOBS.  Ask them how a person capable of performing at the
rate of one-tenth of a horsepower in an eight hour day (if they are in
the peak of physical condition) is going to compete with today's high
speed technology.  As more and more high speed technology is introduced,
there is less need for human muscle power.  Technology is faster, more
efficient, with none of the labour problems associated with human
labour.  Machines are very efficient producers, but consume none of that
which they produce nor use any of the services they supply.  And there
is the rub.  As efficiency increases and more is produced with less and
less human aid, who then consumes, pays the taxes, and how is purchasing
power to be placed into enough hands to keep society operating.  When
that economic impasse is reached, do we close everything down, or do we
realize that all we are lacking is an efficient method of distribution,
a system of accounting based on the energy it took to produce the goods
and services in the first place.  Energy accounting is a method of
distribution more in keeping with the technological, high-energy
civilization in which we now live.  Money is the means of exchanging a
scarcity based on concepts of human labour, but such concepts as
scarcity, exchange and labour are not germane and do not apply in the
age we now live in, fast approaching the 21st century.  Let us bring our
methods of operation into line with the 21st century and discard the
outmoded ideas of our forefathers -- if we expect our species to survive
another century.
