The brouhaha over Murphy Brown (a fictional character) having a baby out
of wedlock was the nadir of silliness.  The Vice-President of the United
States (!) in his zeal to defend the values of "family" life, embroiled
himself in the antics of a fictional TV program!  This in the
"enlightened" 1990s!
<p>
During many centuries any female having a baby out of wedlock was
ostracized.  The rules were very strict: no sex before marriage! -- For
women!  Virginity was a virtue prized above all else.  The fear of
pregnancy kept the girls "nice."  For the males?  That was different.
After all it was the males who made the rule in the first place -- back
in the Middle Ages.  During the sexual revolution of the 1960s and 1970s
this rule has been shattered.  Teenage pregnancies are now out of
control.  Millions of babies are being born who will never know who
their father is.  But diehard conservatives, clergy, politicians (such
as the former Vice-President of the United States) are still longing for
that supposedly ideal of the "nuclear family" consisting of the husband,
the "breadwinner," the wife who stayed home and took care of the house
and children.  This was depicted in commercials and TV "sitcoms" of
various types.  Ads portrayed the "ideal family" as a man and woman, two
children -- a boy (older), with a baseball glove on one hand, and a
girl, clutching a doll in her arms.  This depicted very graphically the
different conditioning the two children received.  The boy was taught
the usual "manly" things, while the girl was conditioned from childhood
that her place would be "in the home."  The focus was on the dominant
white middle-class population; all others were ignored.  The African-
American, the Asian-American, the Native Indian-American, the Mexican-
American were not portrayed.
<p>
The concept of the "nuclear family" took centuries to evolve.  It wasn't
until the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries that paintings,
sculptures, etc., depicting "family scenes" -- men, women and "small
people," presumably children, began to circulate.  Even the concept of
"childhood" had to wait centuries before children were allowed to be
"children."  It is only in recent times that childhood has been extended
into the late teens and early twenties.  During the middle ages,
children were thrust into adult life almost as soon as they could walk.
They were required to do certain chores and participated in the adult
life around them.  Social stratification was very strict; clothes were a
symbol of your station in life.  Children of the well-to-do were sent
to other households to be "educated" and in turn accepted other
families' children for education in their homes.
<p>
The heyday of the "nuclear" family -- man, wife and their children
probably occurred in the 18th and 19th centuries.  The man was the
"head" of the family; this was supported by the mores and folkways of
the time.  The clergy, business men and the politicians all supported
it.  There was a very good reason why this concept of "family" was
supported -- the concept of property ownership.  There was a time back
in the Middle Ages when men and women could hold property separately --
each could buy and sell without consulting any one.  But as the "family"
concept evolved, it became easier to handle if property were to be under
the control of the "man of the house."  This concept of ownership
eventually extended to wife and children -- all owned by the man.  "The
man of the house" was the breadwinner; mother stayed home -- full time,
taking care of the children and home.  The man, as the "breadwinner,"
was free to mingle and be in contact with outside influences; the wife
was necessarily confined to the four walls of the "home."  This
arrangement was not questioned until extraneous energy reared its head
in the form of Watts' steam engine (1776).  Other technological
innovations followed beginning in the 18th century.  Electricity brought
a major revolution into the concept of "home."  The vacuum cleaner, the
electric stove, the automatic washer and dryer, and the dishwasher was a
boon to housewives.  But, it left them with time on their hands, and the
exodus into the workplace began.  They too could work outside the home.
Thus began the disintegration of the "ideal family."  This was not done
by any conscious effort on anybody's part, but the steady decline of the
time rate of doing work by the use of extraneous energy applied to the
means whereby people made their living pushed social change so
inexorably that these changes seemed to take place without anyone being
aware of what was happening.
<p>
Divorces were beginning to become commonplace as early as 1840 and have
increased ever since.  The number of households consisting of husband,
wife and children had fallen from 40% to 26% in two decades.  Today, in
most households, both parents work; "latch-key" children are almost the
norm.  During the 1950s we witnessed the last gasp of the Victorian
ideal of "family values."  With the development of the "Pill" (medical
technology) women no longer feared pregnancies, and the "sexual
revolution" of the 1960s and 1970s was launched which knocked the
concept of "virginity" into a cocked hat.  With millions of children
being born without a "father," how is the concept of "property" going to
be maintained?
<p>
The people who are advocating a return to the old-fashioned values of
the Victorian "family" are blind to the reality of today's social
conditions.  The physical conditions that permitted the development of
the "nuclear family" no longer exist.  The use of extraneous energy has
changed the environment to such an extent that it has made the concept
irrelevant and obsolete.  Divorce and remarriages have spawned an
entirely different combination  of "family" life:  As the divorced
couples re-marry, they each bring their own children into the household,
plus their former in-laws, new in-laws and their offspring and other
relatives of various kinds and genders.  This kind of "extended" family
never existed before.  And there are other combinations that are vying
for attention and acceptance into the concept of "family:"   Homosexual
couples; lesbian couples; single individuals with "live-in" partners and
other combinations with people of similar tastes, et cetera, et cetera!
<p>
The above recombination of what constitutes "family" is keeping social
historians and economic sociologists scratching their heads to attach a
label to this new kind of "family."  Some call it "postindustrial,"
some call it "postmodern," and others have much less flattering terms to
describe the ferment of what is going on.  Whether we like it or not, it
has happened:  social change is here -- now.  The end is not yet in sight
and we cannot go back.  The concept of "family values" has gone the way
of the small family farm, the slide rules, soda fountains in drug stores
and wedding night virginity.
<p>
But -- we haven't "seen nothin' yet!"  Wait until the computer age hits
us with full force.  Already its effects are being felt in every phase
of our society.  Technocracy's technological design is the only concept
that has kept pace with the fast changing social climate that has been
brought in by the use of extraneous energy.
