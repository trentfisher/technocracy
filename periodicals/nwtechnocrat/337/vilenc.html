Shamefully, violence is the hallmark of contemporary times.  Given we
have a highly developed society, where are the roots of such primitive
and destructive behavior?  In their book, Beyond Language; Social and
Cultural Factors in Schooling Language Minority Students, John U. Ogbu,
University of California at Berkeley, and Maria Eugenia Matute-Bianchi,
U. of C. at Santa Cruz address the subject:
<p>
"Deviant behavior is a reflection of the destructiveness of enduring
subordination and relegation in a perpetual caste-like status in
society.  Pervasive and enduring social and economic deprivation have
transformed traditional values into negative, embittered self-
destructive behavioral patterns, frequently of a violent nature."
<p>
In discussing how society might change sufficiently to eliminate the
violence that plagues us, they say:
<p>
"Another prerequisite is to recognize that real change depends on
opening up decent youth and adult futures, not just patching up the
deficiencies of individuals."
<p>
While these sentiments might be read as a call for radical and dramatic
change, they are well buried inside hundreds of pages of scholarly
research.
<p>
So great is violence today that it finds its way into writings that are
intended to be essentially devoted to other social issues.  Issues such
as abortion and health care, are hotly debated, and right now reams of
legislation about immigration are being battled over, and documented and
undocumented immigrants are being alternately frightened, defended, and
targeted.  But research indicates, as the above quotes support, that
society needs to be restructured to provide meaningful futures for human
beings.  Unless we do this, it doesn't matter enough what method we use
to teach English as a Second Language, to support minorities' native
languages, to validate individual cultures. All the ethnic food
festivals and folk dances in the world are not going to change the
poverty, abuse, illiteracy, and lack of opportunity that many of all
races and sexes suffer from on our continent.
<p>
We need a healthy environment to substantially reduce violence.  Many
doing the research may be trying not to make serious waves because their
own careers as professors and researchers provide them with a reasonable
income and intellectual work.  Yet many of their observations are
earnest and the data convincing.  The language may be esoteric at times,
but still their work shows that we need to change our system
fundamentally if we aren't going to ignore and waste the lives of
millions of people.  Otherwise, society's loss is -- and will continue
to be, huge.  The number of people living in disadvantageous conditions
is frightfully large.  We put ourselves at great peril if we choose a
road of denial.
<p>
The hope is that we can move to a social structure proposed by
Technocracy Inc.  We live in a technological age, and this design is
planned and laid out to be compatible with this new age.  This plan for
a new social structure is not dogmatic but simply a framework for how
efficiently goods, services, education, entertainment, etc. could be
provided, distributed and supported.  Our technological age calls for
this down-to-earth method; just "patching up deficiencies" isn't going
to work.
<p>
This design is a method of social operation in which violence would tend
towards zero.  Ogbu and Bianchi must be credited for addressing the
violence problem.  They do not, however, propose enough of a solution.
On the other hand, Technocracy does.  Literature describing Technocracy
can be obtained through the address listed on this publication.  One can
do his or her own study and check out the viability of Technocracy's
conclusions.
