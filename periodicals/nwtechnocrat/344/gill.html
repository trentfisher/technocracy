In a recent science fiction movie, TWELVE MONKEYS, the hero is forced
to live physically underground because the surface of the earth is
too contaminated, and he is trapped in a totalitarian society in which
the vast majority of humans have already died of a deadly virus.  Immediate
survival has taken precedence, as it does in so many Hollywood movies.  Having
traveled back in time to 1996 for a short research assignment, our
hero waxes nostalgic about this time when the streets were crime ridden,
there was no place to park, and homelessness and unemployment plagued
the citizens.  We could easily extend this list of contemporary complaints...and
agree that to some extent suffering is relative.  (Unless your loved
one was just a statistic in the wake of some ugly social breakdown).
<p>
I am a high school teacher on a spring break, one of the vacations
for which teachers are envied.  Going to the movies is a small luxury,
a way most of us get to emulate the idle rich for a couple of hours.  The
truth is, that even with a break, I won't have much ``discretionary''
time or income to fool around with.  For several weeks up to vacation,
we teachers are anxiously awaiting time off.  Our work isn't the back
breaking, dawn to dusk labor of most people living a hundred years
ago, but our work is outrageous.  I often feel like I am on a unicycle
and I can't look around me or I'll crash down.  I must focus on the
next trick which I control with my two hands and my rapidly pedalling
feet.  I am vaguely aware of things I see in my peripheral vision...the
students who only show up once a week, the boy who doesn't eat all
day because his mother's been locked in a mental institution and his
father is raising three kids on a full time job which pays $600 a
month, the incessant false fire alarms set off by wandering students
and ignored entirely by everyone (God forbid there should ever be
a fire,)  the abysmally low level of basic skills, the threat that
teachers will at any minute be held responsible for this lack of basic
skills (beating our heads against the wall as it is to make enough
noise to even get many students' attention.)
<p>
At home I have stacks of papers to grade.  I am proud that I got my
honors class to do research papers, but now I have to grade them.  My
garage needs cleaning, my yard needs work, my child needs help.  I
am a single parent.  There is very little community for support if
anything goes wrong.  I hate being sick as it reminds me of how vulnerable
I am.  There is so much which if I don't do it, doesn't get done.  This
is at home and at school.
<p>
Within an hour of starting my vacation, I walked by a coffee shop
and because I saw two men I know, I sat down on the bench in the sun.  I
have never done this although they do for hours at a stretch.  I watched
them, as if programmed, make cracks about driving skills of people
parking their cars.  They said in unison, "That's right, back up till
you hit something!"  I listened to them express admiration for Ronald
Reagan and George Bush.  I joked that they had chosen some mighty
dull heroes.  We didn't discuss these politicians' attacks on human
rights of women.  Five minutes of this "leisure" sent me scurrying
off the streets for cover.  Male supremacy is alive and well.
<p>
Rather than imagining how much worse things could be, as TWELVE MONKEYS
does, I can envision how much better things could be.  If the school
building weren't collapsing, if I taught two or three courses instead
of five (actually six at the moment,) if the students weren't suffering
from gross inequalities of access to basic necessities.  (My modest
living circumstances put me in a class way above and beyond most of
my students...and this is true of almost all teachers versus students
in inner-city public schools.  The opposite situation prevails in
many private schools, with teachers living much more humble existences
than the wealthy families of their students.  Both these extremes
are not truly healthy if social and intellectual well-being and progress
are primary goals of education.)
<p>
In so many other ways I can picture things better.  What if I didn't
have to spend most of my time anxious that I might forget some of
the dozens of niggling details that comprise contemporary schools
and modern life?  Each day I get home from work and hop on the phone
(if it is not too late) with the insurance company, the rain gutter
man, the dentist, some mutual fund agent, tax accountant, bank employee,
librarian and so on.  I recently had no less than six conversations
with my home insurance company; they had almost doubled my premium.  I
was told, "If you do this (smoke detectors, alarms, extinguishers)
and if you have that (sheer walling, bolting, earthquake proofing)
then we'll give you a 10% discount on this premium and a blah, blah
reduction on that.  Plus we need to come and take pictures and measurements
because of new regulations instituted due to the Oakland fire."
<p>
I accommodated all those demands, made appointments; we took pictures
and I helped measure.  Then a month later an entirely different agent,
same insurance, calls to tell me he is coming to do all the measuring
and photographing.  I say "No!  It has been done."  He said, "Well,
I don't see the paper work here so let's do it again."  "No!"  I persisted,
"That is the stupidest thing I've ever heard.  I have the name of
the person who came, the date, the time!  You track it down!"  He
insisted it would be easier if he just came out and did it all again.  Was
he trying to pad his job?  So many people are worried their jobs will
disappear.  Still I held my ground.  Maybe my house insurance is invalid
now?  What do I know?  After a long day at work, I can't tolerate
some of the waste and inefficiency this system spews out, even if
it resembles some I spew out myself in my job.
<p>
If I do get a few minutes to relax, I'm really lucky if one of my
friends has the same time available.  They are just as swamped with
work, schools, kids and chores as I am.
<p>
And I ask myself, do we really have to live like this?  Technocracy
says we don't.  I have a suspicion Technocracy is right.  I thought
so even before crossing paths with Technocracy.  We have a major distribution
problem.  Technocracy shows how to solve it by giving all North American
citizens equal access to all goods and services.
<p>
Maybe the hero in TWELVE MONKEYS had it wrong, but we'd better not
be grateful for a crime ridden present when the present may be the
precursor to a  nightmarish future.  I don't want to be an alarmist,
but how much more niggling can things get?
