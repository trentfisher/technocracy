... This is an era of great technological development, a time
when a high standard of education is almost a necessity if one is
to have any hope of succeeding or even understanding the many complexities
of life in a modern technological society.  Yet, we find that the
cost of obtaining a higher education is becoming prohibitive.  The
better colleges now carry a price tag of $1,000.00 a week.  (Divide
the annual cost of a school like BRANDIES by the number of weeks (28)
in the college year and you get $1,000.00 a week which is more than
the weekly income of about 70% of the nation's households -- according
to NEWSWEEK magazine.)  In the ten-year period from 1984 to 1994,
the total cost of going to college has nearly doubled, a 95% increase
for private 4 year colleges and 81.7% for public 4 year colleges.  In
the same period of time the median income has increased 46.6% and
the consumer price index 42.6%.  At the same time that tuition costs
are rising, the number of days spent in school have declined.  In
1939-40, schools were in session 195 days a year; in 1993-
94 only 157 days a year were spent in classes.  The cost of attending
college in that same time frame has gone from $3,207 to $15,978 in
inflation adjusted dollars.  A well educated citizenry is essential
for success today, but our social system is certainly making this
accomplishment difficult to obtain.
<p>
... A popular song title of the 1940s ``Someone to watch over
me'' is now taking on a new meaning.  Even George Orwell, in his book
1984, could not visualize the impact that modern technological advances
would have on the ability of people or groups to place others under
surveillance.  Seat sensors to enable your employer to check if you
are occupying your chair, video cameras, drug tests, e-mail monitoring,
badges to track worker's movements, and soon to appear, genetic testing,
to scrutinize the genetically programmed traits of potential or current
employees.  Not going to happen?  In these days of a declining workforce,
the employer or whomever, will set the standards, and compliance will
be the order of the time.
<p>
... In the last issue of this magazine, global warming was discussed.  The
U.N. announced early in May that 1995 was the hottest year ever recorded;
the Antarctic ozone hole lasted longer than ever before.  In the North
Atlantic around the Azores, sea surface temperatures were more than
one degree above normal.
<p>
... Air pollution hampers the development of lung tissue in
children.  A joint U.S.-Canadian study looking at almost 17,000 children
across North America, in the early 1990s found close to 10% of children
were showing reduced lung capacity by the end of the study, which
took place over a three year period.  The most dramatic increase was
in young children up to age five.
<p>
... More than two years after the North American Free Trade
Agreement took effect making available billions of dollars for toxic
clean-up along the border with Mexico, not one environmental project
has been launched.  In Juarez, up to ten people live in single-room
shacks made of cardboard and wood.  These abodes are situated beside
blackened canals oozing with the wastes of teeming slums and industrial
parks.  Foreign-owned factories continue to multiply along the environmentally
besieged frontier, although the trade pact was supposed to push industry
into the Mexican interior.  In Juarez, six open canals absorb the
raw sewage of this city of 1.2 million and its more than 350 industrial
operations.  More than 200,000 litres of untreated waste are dumped
into the Rio Grande every day.  The river is so contaminated with
human waste that experts said skin contact threatens cholera, hepatitis
and dysentery.  Hepatitis rates on the border are two to five times
the U.S. national average.  The number of workers employed by foreign-owned
factories has increased more than 25% since the introduction of NAFTA
just over two years ago -- from 546,000 in 1993 to 689,000 by September
1995.  In the first 11 months of 1995, 400 new factories opened up
along the border.  If NAFTA were to be evaluated by the state of the
water, air and public health in the U.S.-Mexico border area, then
it would appear to be an abject failure.    How absurd!  Human health
being ignored for a profitable bottom line.
<p>
... According to the sixth biennial report 1994-95 of the
World Resources Institute, trends are still accelerating in the wrong
direction.  Twenty ``megacities'' have unhealthy air and violate World
Health Organization guidelines for at least one pollutant.  Mexico
City is the worst with serious levels of sulphur dioxide suspended
particulate matter, carbon monoxide and ozone, plus heavy levels of
lead and nitrogen oxides.  Tropical deforestation averaged 0.8% a
year in the 1980s, which means that an area three times the size of
France was converted to other uses.  Toxic emissions are enormous
in all countries with significant industrialized sectors, with the
U.S. the largest polluter.  Industrialized countries also account
for the largest emissions of ``greenhouse'' gases.  The U.S. and former
Soviet Union, together, contribute 32.8%; and European Community nations
contribute 12.4%
<p>
... World fisheries have declined steadily since 1989.  An equally
disturbing trend is that many overfished species such as cod, haddock
and west Atlantic bluefish tuna are being replaced by less valuable
species.
<p>
... More and more surveys are showing that people in general
are becoming increasingly dissatisfied and want a change.  A recent
survey found that 61% of Americans said it is not enough to change
the faces in Washington; we have to change the system.  Now, we are
getting somewhere -- or are we?  If by change those people mean
a new political party or a different approach by business, then their
conclusion is meaningless and will accomplish nothing.  The fault
lies with a system that was borne in antiquity, is scarcity-based
on person- hours of labour, and is dependent on selling one's time
in exchange for debt tokens or money.  It is a system that exchanges
its goods and services on a basis of commodity valuation and uses
any form of debt tokens or money.  It cannot function in a society
with an installed capacity of 35 billion horsepower (U.S.); and that
is the energy equivalent of 350 billion people working at a rate of
1/10th horsepower.  Not only is this an impossible situation when
concerning the creation or supplying of jobs; it is also wreaking
havoc on the environment -- as we continue to produce material
exclusively for profit without any consideration for the impact it
is having on this planet on which we must survive.  Time is fast running
out; this planet cannot for much longer absorb the punishment we are
inflicting on it.  The land, the water, the atmosphere, all are being
subjected to immense pressure.  We, as a species, are threatened.
Over-population,
a declining resource base, lack of potable water, mounting pollution,
soil erosion, are just some of the problems threatening our existence.  A
recent survey of population growth and food supply, as pointed out
on the cover, ended with the comment ``Humanity's greatest challenge
may soon be just making it to the next harvest.''  We must change the
system -- but tinkering is not change; a real basic fundamental
change is mandatory.  An old, outmoded system of exchange, based on
commodity valuation, must be replaced by one based on energy accounting,
using technology to serve our needs and enhance our lives, rather
than as a means of obtaining short term monetary advantage.  That
has resulted in all of the problems we now see confronting us.  We
must have a complete break with the concepts of scarcity, with the
installation of a social system more in keeping with the technological
age in which we live -- nothing less will suffice.
