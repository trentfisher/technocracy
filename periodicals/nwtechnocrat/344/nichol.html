<p>
For the first time in the history of mankind, human knowledge has
become sufficient to determine the physical characteristics required
to implement the world's first intelligently directed society.  History
will record this event as the greatest human achievement of the 20th
century.  Always in the past, society has been led by the strong man,
the witch doctor, medicine man, petty chiefs, kings, emperors and
presidents or prime ministers -- all using what has come to be
called, the political method.
<p>
The political method is a social decision-making process determined
by beliefs and opinions, superstitions and traditions of the time,
many of which were more or less dictated by the political leaders
as a self appointed task, and have, therefore been susceptible to
the many inaccuracies therefrom.  In recent times, this method has
become quite obsolete in many areas of human activity.  Society has
outgrown many of the above types of leadership, with only a president
and congress or a prime minister and parliament, nominated by a few
and elected by many, remaining to provide significant political control.
<p>
The economic methods ``designed'' by the cunning and the greedy have
supported such ``leaders'' since the development of the ``Barter System''
at some time in the distant past.  In today's world, politics is
inappropriate.  The
decision making processes required in a high energy, highly complex,
computer controlled technological world are different.  This modern
technological world has outmoded the economic control techniques that
are part of the political method.
<p>
Human education has been a slow and often difficult task with political
and economic interference all the way.  It has certainly not been
easy to replace the political and economic superstitions of the past
with the factual information of the present.  The self-satisfying
beliefs that one's opinions are correct cannot be overcome without
resistance.  Only with the development of the scientific method did
humans begin to realize that only factual information, determined
by careful study and measurement and verifiable by others, could be
considered accurate.  As this technique gained acceptance, there has
been a rapidly increasing understanding of that real world of matter
and energy, and even of humans themselves.  New ideas, if factual,
became easier to accept.  It was only after the background in scientific
knowledge had reached sufficient heights was mankind prepared for
phenomenal technological growth.
<p>
To illustrate graphically the explosive growth of the technological
world in recent times, a review of the number of patents issued by
the U.S. Patent Office may suffice.  In 1790, the number of patents
issued was 3.  In 1850, 60 years later, the number was 823.  In 1929,
it was 45,267 and in 1992, the number reached 106,800.  Since these
statistics show no decline in the rate of growth, we assume that this
progression will continue at an increasing rate.
<p>
And now, the technologists are preparing to make accessible almost
any recorded information: movies, video games, VCR and TV shows, whole
libraries of information, home shopping by TV, banking, educational
programs for children and adults -- information to all citizens
who can pay for the service.  From a technical standpoint it can probably
be done.  However, it will require many billions of dollars to design,
produce and install the necessary equipment to allow 264 million Americans
and 30 million Canadians to participate in such a complex project.
<p>
There are many important and highly technical projects which should
be given a higher priority and that are also possible from a technical
standpoint -- producing equipment to make automobiles crash-proof,
for example.  But it is doubtful if the economic system can distribute
sufficient purchasing power to make it possible for North Americans
to enjoy them.  In the U.S. we already have 38 million Americans living
in poverty with a federal debt of $5 trillion.  With the interest
on this debt the second highest of all government expenditures and
with politicians trying to avoid bankruptcy, the economic system is
extended about as far as possible.
<p>
As technologists continue to make possible many new technological
marvels, the politico-economic ``knowledge'' available continues to
become further antiquated by comparison.  Already technology has resulted
in great changes in our lifestyles -- the trend is ongoing at an
ever faster pace.  Consider the steam-engine which made power available
to start the greatest technological development of all time.  Consider
the electrical generator and power grid, the telephone, the automobile,
and now the computer which can supply the control technique for all
the other technology so that it can operate without human hands.
<p>
Not only will this vast, and increasing, technology require overall
control methods which are appropriate, but the very nature of the
job to be done will demand far more intelligence than can be supplied
by any control technique based on beliefs, opinions, tradition, prejudice,
superstition, or the concepts of the market place.  Therefore the
political method, in all its various forms, must be discarded and
consigned to the Museum of Political Nonsense to assist future generations
in understanding what shouldn't be done.  Impossible?  That is what
the witch doctor thought, but he survived only by updating his approach
to that of a ``modern'' politician.
<p>
The role that a political government plays in a technological society
is to referee the inequities created by a defective economic system.  An
intelligently designed economic system would have the defects engineered
out and wouldn't need such an ineffective political method as a referee.  The
first requirement for an intelligently directed society would therefore,
require a completely redesigned economic system, one which wouldn't
allow 38 million Americans, more than the total population of Canada
and Alaska combined, to live in poverty when a technologically produced
plenty is available.  It would require a completely redesigned social
control technique capable of smoothing out the oscillations in the
productive process and match total production with total consumption.  It
would be necessary for the people who administer such a control to
understand the physical requirements -- technologists, not politicians.  Very
few laws would be needed to keep people from stealing that which they
already have plenty of, so humans could be free to do almost anything
they wanted to do -- if it were physically possible and didn't
interfere with other peoples' freedom to do the same.
<p>
Unfortunately, there is no intelligently directed society now existing
that could be used as an example for studying its operating
characteristics.  We
are on our own, and it will be necessary to investigate the possibilities
ourselves. To do so we must reaffirm the factual and discard the non-factual
information.  This is the last roadblock to the installation of the
world's first intelligently directed society.  Difficult yes, but
not impossible.  The knowledge is available; the motivation should
be sufficient when one considers the unmitigated mess we are now in,
with millions living in poverty and near poverty in a land of plenty,
with overall purchasing power decreasing as underemployment is increased
-- with environmental degradation, crime and an overall public
and private debt of more than $20 trillion.  It is obvious that the
continuation of present trends will dump us into an impossible situation
in the near future.
<p>
Will a revolution be required?  Of course a revolution will be required,
and a major one at that.  We, on this Continent, are already well
into the greatest revolution in all of recorded history.  According
to Webster, a revolution is, ``a sudden and violent change of the government
or the political constitution of a country, usually by internal instigation;
a radical change of circumstances in a scientific social, or industrial
system.  The latter part of this definition is a fitting definition
of our progression that has taken place for more than a century.
<p>
The word ``revolution'' is usually thought to mean an uprising of the
population resulting in a new set of political leaders.  Such a revolution
usually is comparatively unimportant except to those few individuals
who are directly concerned with the change in leadership.  Changing
political leaders, whether by vote or by force, accomplishes very
little for society as a whole.  The majority must still work at the
same type of tasks with the same living standards as before.  The
type of revolution we are now in, and have been in, is a technological
revolution which changes the means whereby we live, increases the
ability to produce and could increase living standards drastically.  However,
before everyone can enjoy the potential plenty technology can now
produce, changes are required that have so far been unknown.  Changes
that reduce political actions to near irrelevance, changes in environmental
conditions, and changes in social control techniques to match the
physical requirements of the new conditions.
<p>
The physical revolution of this technological age is in a process
of forcing North American citizens to seriously consider the changes
required in their methods of social and economic control.  The increasing
crime, both legal and illegal, underemployment, homelessness, poverty
in the midst of plenty, war, ecological deterioration, greed, so-
called moral deterioration, loss of confidence in political leaders,
debt, inflation and a general feeling of insecurity -- all on a Continent
with an impending major social change.  This social turbulence will
continue to increase as technology continues to outgrow social control
techniques.  Social disturbances will smooth out and disappear when
control techniques are brought into balance with the technological
age in which we now live.
<p>
In spite of all human efforts in the past, or present, to force the
physical world in which we must live to conform to our desires, wishes
and opinions, it just continues to refuse to operate except according
to natural laws.  The sun continues to rise in the east, and the plenty
our technology can produce increasingly can't be bought and sold despite
the manipulations of man-made economic customs.  The solutions to
poverty cannot be solved by the destruction of farm products to maintain
scarcity and price, or by building obsolescence into our products
to increase sales.  No system can distribute the plenty our technology
can produce for a price, either with or without a profit -- 38
million Americans living in poverty and a $5 trillion federal debt
should be ample proof that a Price System cannot work in a technological
era.
<p>
The only effective method by which plenty can be distributed, like
the air we breathe, is without price.   As long as an economy based
on price, a Price System, is continued, an intelligently directed
society cannot exist.  To maintain price requires the destruction
of a  technological abundance.  People who support such a system regard
money as being more important than people.  That is greed, not
intelligence.  In
the meantime our technology becomes ever more efficient and is able
to produce an ever increasing amount with an ever declining total
number of man-hours of human labor per unit of production.  Those
trends have accelerated to the point that it is eliminating the need
for millions of workers and underemployment is the result.  An intelligently
operated society would have no poverty in the midst of plenty.  And
it would not ruin the physical environment to produce an ever greater
quantity of shoddy products.
<p>
The physical revolution has already occurred; the revolution remaining
before us to complete the long journey into an intelligently operated
society is a revolution of the ``mind.''  Unfortunately this is the
most difficult of all, it requires a mental housecleaning to trash
all the old antiquated political and economic superstitions passed
on from the past.  North Americans already have the necessary physical
resources and technology to provide every citizen with plenty of everything
produced.  Now we need an engineered method of distribution.
<p>
It will accomplish nothing useful to waste time blaming those responsible
for interfering with the widespread dissemination of this knowledge
to the public.  Call it an act of social treason, if you must, and
then proceed with the act of learning and teaching the factual information
provided by Technocracy Inc.  After this is done; after the social
and economic problems of an antiquated economic and political system
have been replaced with an intelligent social mechanism capable of
functioning in a high energy, computer controlled technological society;
history will then record what has happened while we enjoy a thousand
years of peace and plenty made possible by this vast technological
mechanism that has forced us into making the mental changes necessary
to reach that goal.
