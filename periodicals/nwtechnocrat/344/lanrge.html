<hr>
The story of humanity is best characterized by the almost total lack
of social progress throughout our history.  We have, since our appearance
on this planet, moved from small groups of individuals living predominantly
on whatever was close at hand and sheltering in whatever was available,
into larger groups sharing dwellings and a food supply made more stable
by the utilization of cereal grains and domesticated animals.
<p>
This close proximity necessitated the development of both spoken and
written communications.  As communications became more universal,
the collective experience of humankind became accessible to more and
more of the populace.  The written word, or pictographic representation
of the human experience, was now available to future generations.  Much
of what we now know of past civilizations is based upon this historical
record.
<p>
As humankind gradually expanded outward from different areas of habitation,
knowledge was interchanged between the various groups.  This expansion,
although slow, was persistent enough to see most of the world populated
to a greater or lesser degree by the late 1700s.
<p>
However, neither the life expectancy nor the standard of living had
changed much for the average person.  Life was still a day-to-day
struggle for the necessities, and the small amount of extra production
that could be managed by the individual was expropriated by those
in power.  However, a new era was dawning.  The scientific method
gradually took hold.  Logical thought, powered by intuitive insight,
brought new understanding to life processes.  Every field of endeavour
saw a blossoming of knowledge followed by the application of this
knowledge to productive activities.  The energy inherent in fossil
fuels was released in a controlled manner allowing the building of
prime movers harnessing hundreds and then thousands of horsepower.  The
industrial revolution had begun.
<p>
The resulting increase in the technological ability to produce had
the potential of destroying scarcity and made it necessary to allow
individuals to partake in this abundance.  For the first time in history,
a major shift in the consumption of goods had taken place, and although
very uneven, an increase in the standard of living had arrived.  This
ability to substitute extraneous energy for human energy, is the only
reason for our increased standard of living.
<p>
Unfortunately however, our method of distributing this increase in
production has not seen the same progress.  Born in the dark recesses
of our ancient past, this monetary-debt system that we are still using
to distribute today's abundance, is about as functional and makes
about the same amount of sense as it would be to use the pony express
to move our daily communications instead of with the integrated high-speed
voice and data links now in service.  No one will argue against the
benefits that have accrued to civilization since the dawn of the industrial
revolution.  Our education system has been available to a larger percentage
of the population than in any previous time, as has health care, housing,
transportation, food and entertainment.
<p>
But, the other side of the coin is much darker.  As with any quest
for knowledge, you cannot restrict your research to areas or directions
that allow only benevolent results.  The negative aspects of any research,
particularly when corrupted by economic and political considerations,
can be used to develop both programs and hardware that are not only
unnecessary, but socially destructive.  Past and current weapons development
is part of this equation.  The current problems with both chemical
and nuclear waste, is also a result of this interference.
<p>
As we continue to amass knowledge at an exponential rate, the industrial
revolution, now called the information revolution is providing an
acceleration of our ability to substitute extraneous energy for human
energy.  If we carefully examine the implications of this knowledge
explosion with an eye to past trends, we discover that what we are
facing is not new at all, but simply an acceleration of a unidirectional
series of events that will lead to a state of chaos.
<p>
The economic ramifications of the increased substitution of extraneous
energy for human energy; the continuous introduction of new technology
with its increase in output and concurrent decrease in man-hours required
for each unit produced, was well documented in the early 1900s.  The
Wall Street debacle of 1929 and the consequent depression of the "dirty
thirties" was a result of those factors acting in concert with an
economic system that demands continuous expansion of investment or
debt in order to function.  This operative condition of our economic
system has not changed.
<p>
The price, or monetary system that is currently in place in North
America, cannot distribute the production of our industrial plant.  This
trend was slowed somewhat by the non-productive (i.e. consumer goods)
war years and the subsequent expansion of our industrial plant during
that period when we rebuilt a badly damaged world at the expense of
our resources.  But the trend did not stop, and what we are now witnessing
is an acceleration of the same circumstances that first arose earlier
in this century.
<p>
The current unemployment, underemployment, and more significantly,
disemployment problems, foreshadow dislocations unheard of even during
the great depression.  As the powers-that-be attempt to hold on to
the system to maintain their position of privilege, the distribution
of goods and services will become fractionalized and spasmodic for
an ever greater number of dislocated Techno-peasants; and while the
peasant of the pre-industrial revolution at least had the land to
provide their food, even that possibility will be denied the unemployed
today on our overpopulated and denuded continent.
<p>
There is no economic answer to the problems of today.  The problems
are inherent in the system itself.  If we are to move into the future
with any hope of maintaining a high standard of living, we must do
it now.  Every day that we procrastinate we reduce our chances that
we will have the resources and environment to ensure a standard of
living that we will be able to enjoy for a long period of time.  Only
Technocracy with its functional design for production and distribution
based on energy accounting, has the blueprint for the future.  Your
support for Technocracy is your ticket to the future.
