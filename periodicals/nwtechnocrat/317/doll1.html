<p>
In 1818, Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley wrote a book.  As noisome as this
was to a society in which female writers frequently had to use
pseudonyms in order to get published, Mary had earlier tweaked
puritanical noses by capturing the affections of poet Percy Bysshe
Shelley who, unfortunately, already had a wife.  (Mary and Percy were
finally married when his first wife died in 1816.)
<p>
What concerns us is not Mary Shelley's seeming knack for flaunting the
status quo of the early 1800s.  What is more important to us is her
book, Frankenstein, and how we may relate it to the present mess in
which we find ourselves.
<p>
As any literary buff or moviegoer knows, the Frankenstein story is a
tale of the archetypal mad scientist (a legacy for which Mrs. Shelley
may be forgiven), Baron von Frankenstein, who manages to assemble a
number of various and sundry body parts and, with a jolt from his
electrodes, revivifies this melange of metatarsals, creating a
hulking, muddled monster.  Naturally, Dr. Frankenstein's creation
eventually goes out of control and terrorizes the countryside.
<p>
Dr. Frankenstein had his human-made monster to deal with.  We have our
own monster, just as muddled, but far more dangerous.  The greatest
danger is that this monster is also a creation of humankind but has
been around so long that its creators allowed the monster to become
the master and will go to any lengths to protect their creation.
<p>
The monster is, of course, the Price System, that outmoded, hulking
misanthrope of antiquity  that dictates that men and women must work
by the sweat of their brow in order to secure a certain amount of a
medium of exchange that they in turn trade in for things they need.  A
fallacy that springs forth at the outset is the placing of a
philosophical value on people's services and on the goods they
purchase, subject to the whims of the bargaining parties.  It is
inconceivable to think that in a high-energy, technological age, we
still use this system of fish-market haggling to control the
consumption of our resources, but of course we do.  It is the only
means by which those who control the medium of exchange may exercise
their dominance over the population as a whole.
<p>
The Price System monster is a smiling, deceptive one that tells us
that if we work hard, diligently and honestly, we will accomplish much
in the way of securing the things we need for a comfortable life.  Of
course, such assurances ring as false as a politician's promise when
one enters the real world of debt and competition for money.  There
are simply too many hustlers, too many winners, too many drug dealers,
too many fellows being paid millions for beating each other up, and,
just to make ends meet to believe in the so-called work ethic, a
concept that the monster uses to perpetuate itself.
<p>
The Price System monster is also an accomplished hypnotist, a talent
that it has used effectively to manipulate its own creators.  For
thousands of years it has succeeded in mesmerizing people into
believing that they cannot exist without paying due homage to the
monster.
<p>
But as time went on and superstition fell to science and reason,
something went wrong with the monster as it did in Shelley's story.
The masters that it had perversely held in abeyance for so many years
started driving tractors.  They devised ways to make more things
faster and better in order to distribute them to a wider field of
consumers.  And finally they started realizing that the physical
planet, Earth, could not support the monster forever.
<p>
In desperation the monster, adaptable as it had become through
millenia of experience, fought back.  It created shortages.  It plowed
surplus food under to keep prices up.  When the factory output
overwhelmed the ability of the people to pay for the goods, it snapped
its fingers, and credit appeared.  When people could not continue to
feed the monster because they couldn't afford increasing medical
bills, and also were convinced that when a loved one died so did their
means of livelihood, the monster created insurance companies and
lawsuits.
<p>
That's not all the Price System monster has done in its all-out,
life-or-death struggle to save itself.  As it has used its power over
humankind to assure its continued existence, it has used its
human-made cousin, technology -- which threatened to destroy it -- to
revivify itself, much as Dr. Frankenstein used his electrodes to zap
his monster to life.  The Price System monster directs its slaves to
use their machines to level forests, to pollute rivers, to deal death
and destruction, even to withhold things that would benefit humankind
until they promise to inject an adequate transfusion of green blood
into the veins of the monster.
<p>
Even children are not spared. From toddler to teen, the child's
loyalty to the monster is ingrained.  Children, for whom we claim such
a high regard, spend a lot of time on doorsteps, clutching either a
housekey or, Willy Loman-like, overpriced boxes of candy they are
coerced into selling because, somehow, their school or club's budget
always seems to fall short.  Laughing clowns, ever at the monster's
beck and call, lure them into fast food outlets, while cartoon figures
coax them into the snack food aisles where the next generation of
heart attacks are nurtured.  The monster even lurks in the halls of
the places where children are supposed to learn the things they need
to grow into useful, worthwhile adults.  It smiles and tells the
children that other children won't like them unless they wear the
latest name brand clothes or demand that their parents pay 30 or 40
dollars so that they can advertise a soft drink across their little
chests.  Worst of all, it uses their schools to teach them that their
prime purpose in learning is to go out and slave to feed the monster.
<p>
The Price System's hold on humankind is so tenacious that intelligent
people still look to the monster to deliver them from the problems
that the monster itself created.  Medical technology has advanced
phenomenally over the last 50 years, yet it remains unavailable to
many who must resort to public begging to satisfy the demands of Price
System medicine.  With all the things technology has provided to make
life easier and more comfortable, we find ourselves working more jobs
and longer hours and having less time to enjoy the benefits of our
prosperity.  We suffer indignity and abuse on our jobs and turn our
heads when we see something wrong in order to maintain our tenuous
hold on security.  And to top it all off, we lie back in mute
complacency and take whatever the Price System dishes out -- poor
quality goods, child pornography, higher taxes, inflation, rampant
drug use, ruination of the environment, et al -- in the silly belief
that the Price System monster will make everything all right in the
end if we just feed it enough.
<p>
In Mary Shelley's time there were those opposed to mechanized travel
on the grounds that they believed dire consequences would result if
people were to travel faster than they could physically move.  And in
a Price System mode they would be right.  Therein lies the root cause
for our social distress.
<p>
Humankind is caught up in a hell-bent-for-leather scramble to keep up
with the technologies they have created.  Rather than sitting back and
letting their creations work for them, they are stubbornly lashed
astride their mount, vainly striking their rowels into the faltering
flanks of the Price System monster upon which they have depended for
so long.  And their mount is falling ever farther behind.
<p>
This, then, is why we are setting records in teen suicides, why we
immerse ourselves in drugs and pickle ourselves in alcohol to escape
the maddening pace that the Price System demands of us.  We hustle.
We bustle.  We curse when the line doesn't move fast enough.  We rail
at the computer that takes a full five seconds to give us the mail
when five years ago we were happy to get a letter back in five days.
We attempt to utilize our technologies in a silly beat-the-clock race
while the monster bellows, "Time is Money!"
<p>
A classic case in point of the Price System monster's modus operandi
is the booming business in drug and alcohol treatment centers.
Nowhere can be seen a better example of a self-feeding Price System
situation, in which the Price System generates sufficient stress to
create a social problem, then comes up with a high-priced palliative
that, in truth, does nothing more than feed the ever-grumbling maw of
the monster, thus strengthening its power over society.  And all the
while it is being fed more and more of its life-sustaining currency by
promoting and advertising anti-drug campaigns to divert attention from
the real culprit.
<p>
Any organism, amoeba or politico-economic system will fight its
hardest when it is struggling for its life.  And it won't care whom it
hurts in the process.  This is what we are witnessing at present:  the
Price-System organism's desperate, reckless attempt at
self-preservation.
<p>
Technocracy presents a reasonable, scientific approach to the social
disruption that the Price System monster is creating in its death
throes.  It is a planned social structure that would guarantee a
maximum standard of living for each and every citizen of North
America, an equal, irrevocable share in the bounty of our continent
with minimal output of physical effort.  It is only our blind fealty
to the Price System monster, born of fear, of want, and of a nebulous
notion of individual freedom (which, of course, is something the
monster will never allow) that keeps us from achieving this end.
<p>
Frankenstein is a classic horror story, a tragedy of misdirected
technology.  More tragic still is the fact that Mary Shelley's own
story is a classic account of the tribute the Price System demands of
so many talented people.  Frankenstein turned out to be Mary Shelley's
only work of note, not for lack of writing skill, but for the fact
that, following the death of her husband in 1822, she was forced into
a life of writing hack material to keep food on the table.
<p>
It is a pity that a Technocratic society was not available to Mary
Shelley and her contemporaries.  Who knows what masterpieces she may
have produced had she been freed of the necessity of putting food on
the table?
<p>
Such freedom is available now, to us.  More the pity will it be if we
choose to exercise a deceptive freedom and let the Price System
monster take us with it when it goes.
