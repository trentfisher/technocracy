``Smoking May be Hazardous to Your Health'' is a warning that is
printed on every pack of cigarettes.  This small statement was printed
on boxes of cigarettes after years of crusading by a few dedicated
scientists, civic leaders, citizens and physicians.  A crusade was
also launched against saccharin, a suspected carcinogen; cyclomates
have been barred from retail store shelves.  There have been other
crusades against some chemical or other, some activity or other, all
taken very seriously and pursued to some degree with righteousness and
an aura of serving the ``public good.''  The press devotes a great deal
of time and space to these campaigns as news items.  A great deal of
research goes into these activities.
But the one crusade, the one campaign that deserves banner headlines
in every newspaper, day after day, the one thing that is truly
hazardous to <em>everybody's</em> health is never mentioned -- the
<strong>Price System</strong>.
<p>
Cigarette smoking is hazardous to one's health -- if one smokes them.
Cyclomates and saccharin are perhaps harmful to those who use them.
But there are substances that are being inhaled, imbibed, and ingested
by the public (without its knowledge) that will prove far more harmful
than cigarettes or saccharin -- not only to the immediate victims but
to unborn generations to come (radiation is only one example).  Not
even the trees, grass and animals in the world are immune from the
environmental pollution that rains down on the earth from chemical
substances and particulates that are spewed forth from smokestacks.
Industrial wastes are dumped and buried in the ground or poured into
rivers and oceans.  These practices by industry are destroying the
environment.  Not much is done about it because it would ``cost too
much'' to devise technology or techniques of prevention.  Legislation
is being devised in an attempt to control future dumping, but that
which is already dumped and fouling up the environment is hardly
touched.
<p>
The Price System has one inflexible rule:  Does it pay (in terms of
money, of course)?  Every product must show a profit; every endeavor
must prove its money making capabilities; otherwise it ceases to exist.
<p>
The chemical age, which was ushered in after World War II, has been
proven to be the biggest bonanza of all time.  The magic of chemistry
was hailed as a panacea to end humankind's ills.  A headline in a
Cleveland, Ohio newspaper in March of 1948 reads:  ``Sees Chemistry's
Age of Abundance End War.''  The prognosticator was William J. Hale,
research consultant at that time for the Dow Chemical Company.  He
went on to say, ``For the next 1,000 years, our civilization will be
based on three great new industries -- plastics, alcohol and light
metals, in that order...''  He went on to explain how plastics could be
made from a variety of plants.  ``Plant life breaks down into lignum,
starch, gums, vegetable oils, fats and alcohol that the chemist simply
puts together in different ways.  Then we come to alcohol.  There
you've got something.  Ethyl Hydroxide is the most diverse chemical
compound known to man.''  He warned then that gasoline is the worst
fuel for automobiles.  Speaking of the nonrenewable resources such as
coal and hydrocarbons, he stated that he hoped ``we would not continue
to exploit and destroy these nonrenewable resources...''  He said he
hoped some would be left for the future when ``man had become
intelligent enough to use them properly.''  This highly optimistic
picture of the future was never given a chance.  The nonrenewable
resource, petroleum, was exploited to the hilt.  In just a few short
decades our dependence on oil and its byproducts is nearly complete:
plastics, synthetics, detergents, sprays, paints, medicines, cloth and
other materials too numerous to list -- all made chemically from oil
(petrochemicals).  The plastic wrap (pliofilm) that we bring our
groceries home in is the least of the products that is made from
petroleum by-products.  From the time that the ``chemical age'' burst
open at the close of World War II until now, the waste products, the
residues from the manufacture of all the plastics, synthetics,
herbicides and pesticides were buried in area that were deemed
unsuitable for anything else.  Haulers were contracted who disposed of
the wastes as cheaply as possible.  The producers of the wastes were
thus freed of obligation to the community or to the public in general.
They paid for the haulage as good business practice under the Price
System and there ended their obligation. 
<p>
Billion of dollars were spent by business to advertise their wares;
the public bought, used and then threw away all those pretty plastic
converings, those ``convenience'' products that are supposed to make
life so wonderful in this modern day and age.  Do you have mosquitoes
in your yard?  Get a spray can of good ol' something or other and
spray them away.  The list is endless, generating billions of tons of
waste cans, plastics, foils, bottles and other throwaway wonders --
products of the laboratories of the new ``chemical age.''
<p>
Out of the front door of these laboratories poured synthetic materials
that rivaled the richest silks and brocades of ancient times.
Synthetic materials imitated fur, velvet, satin or the sheerest
gossamer fabrics of incredible tensile strength.  Weed killers enabled
farmers to increase the yields of their acreage ten-fold and at the
same time freed them from back breaking toil. The preservation of food
was merely another miracle of the laboratories.
<p>
There is no denying that chemistry has created an easier world, a
victory over nature, as one scientist put it.  But it could very well
be a Pyrrhic victory because of the effluent that flows out the back
door of these same laboratories.  Unimaginable chemical combinations
were disposed of in the most careless fashion (and still are).  It was
cheaper just to dump the residues than to apply scientific means to
detoxify or render neutral the waste at the source; it can be done but
it would ``cost too much.''  At present count, it is estimated that
there exists some 50,000 waste disposal sites around the United
States, seeping noxious fumes into the air or seeping deadly chemicals
into the ground waters.
<p>
It took humankind centuries to climb out of an ignorance and
superstition that we find quaint; that diseases were caused by germs
was scoffed at by the most learned men and women of ages past.  It
took much trial and error to arrive at what now seems simple
precautions against illness.  The wearing of clothing stopped many
diseases that were caused by skin contact from one individual to
another.  It took humankind centuries to come up with medicines and
procedures to cure the sick.  Vaccines have been developed to the
point where, it is possible, the last case of smallpox has been
erased.  Humankind have found solutions to many ills that had plagued
them from the very beginning.  The simple procedure of replacing
thatched roofs with wood or tile prevented the spread of diseases by
removing the breeding places of vermin -- rats, mice and other rodents
-- that were carriers of disease.
<p>
But in just a few decades, humankind have foisted upon themselves a
kind of plague that no amount of medical skill will cure because there
is no known cure for chemical poisoning; there are no known vaccines
against it.  The ones who resisted the early medical doctors and
scientists with their vaccination and preventive medicine were
ignorant, unschooled people, still wallowing in some ancient
superstition of their own.  The people who developed the new chemicals
and this wonderful new world of throwaway junk are brilliant men and
women, well educated in their line of work.  The language they speak
is lime no language on earth.  This is a language learned in the
laboratories and class rooms of our most prestidious universities.
But the end result of their work will be worse than the devastation
wrought by the black death of the middle ages.  Down through the ages,
humankind did learn to live with their microbes and their viruses.
They developed a biological immunity to the microbes they had to live
with because they too were organic entities.  But there is not enough
time to develop immunological defenses against inorganic chemicals.
<p>
This is what Celso Bianco, immunologist at the State University of New
York, has to say:  ``The human system can vanquish the highly complex
flu virus, made of thousands of amino acids and nucleic acids.  But we
are susceptible to a simple chemical such as DDT, which is composed of
only 14 carbons, 9 hydrogen and 5 chlorine molecules.  An important
difference between flu virus and DDT, is that the latter was not
present in our environment until recently, and consequently was not a
selective pressure during the evolution of our immune system.  Had we
been exposed several million years ago to DDT and other recently
synthesized chemicals, our cells might have developed means of
breaking these substances into harmless byproducts.  Industrial
pollutants constitute a selective pressure that we are physiologically
unprepared to handle at present.  Since some of these new materials
affect our genetic material, they can cause mutations.  Theoretically,
over time, we could expect populations capable of resisting pollutants
to appear within the human species.  Unfortunately, there are
inarguable objections to allowing nature to take its course.  First,
we do not want to deliberately bring deformed beings into the world;
in any case, we have no guarantee that an immune population would
indeed appear.''  (Reported in <cite>Natural History Magazine</cite>, 1979.)
<p>
We have perhaps the highest education rate, the most schools, the best
universities in the world, but we have behaved like tribes of
primitives who look for signs in the slies for guidance when it comes
to our collective safety and survival.  Our quest for money has
over-shadowed our intelligence.  Every action is measured against what
is profitable and what is not.  The producers of the industrial wastes
are not alone to blame for the staggering number of waste dumps.
Peter Ibsen's <cite>An Enemy of the People</cite> (1882) is a classic depiction
of the greed of city fathers itching after wealth.  The locale is a
resort town dependent on tourists to come to the mineral baths located
there.  A doctor of the town discovers that the baths are polluted.
When he advised the town leaders of this fact, instead of welcoming
the news and doing something about it, they labeled him ``an enemy of
the people.''  The news of the pollution naturally would halt the
tourist influx asnd thereby the money they would bring.  A parallel
can be drawn in the case of the now notorious Love Canal.  The leaders
of the city of Niagara permitted the dumping of the waste.  They
wanted the business and the money that industry would bring in.  They
did not investigate; the dumpers of the chemicals did not explain what
went into the canal.  The developers and home builders around the area
either did not care or they didn't know.  It was not investigated --
``it would cost too much.''  Not until the situation literally blew up
in their faces was something done -- but not enough.  This is the
situation clear across the continent.  The Price System does not allow
for human or environmental consideration. 
<p>
Huge sums of money ($600 to $700 million) are being appropriated by
Congress for clean-up purposes.  This is not enough.  We must change
the entire structure of our society.  Then and only then will we be
able to stop the pollution at the source.  Without the consideration
of money, research can be done to PREVENT rather than cure, because
there really is no cure.  Unless we institute a system to halt the
spread of the chemical poisoning, we will be inundated by our own
effluent.
<p>
With the discontinuance of money, as proposed by Technocracy, will be
the elimination of the practice of putting a price tags on human
lives, the end of putting a price tag on whether or not the
environment is worth saving or not and how much of it is to be saved.
Technocracy embodies the concept of the conservation of resources,
both human and otherwise.
