... Rudyard Kipling wrote ``One of the few certainties of human 
progress is that the burnt fool's bandaged finger goes waggling 
back to the fire.''  How many times will we, as a species, get 
burned before we cry enough, or will we never learn to cry enough, 
and keep on repeating the same mistakes, until we, like many other 
species before us, disappear from this planet?  We are said to 
have the ability to reason, to learn and to project, there is 
little evidence of this; we keep on repeating the same old 
mistakes and adding new ones.  Our planet is slowly losing its 
ability to support life as we know it -- entirely due to our 
refusal to acknowledge that our actions are the main cause of the 
problem.  And that is our refusal to realize that in the name of 
economic expediency we are endangering the long-term survival of 
human and other life forms on this planet earth.
<p>
... The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released a report in 
February that provided the names of 75,000 firms which emit toxic 
wastes.  North Carolina is among the worst states; they spewed 100 
million pounds of toxic chemicals into the surrounding environment 
in 1987.  The goverment of the province of Quebec has drawn up a 
list of the 600 worst polluters in that province, and Ontario's 
Hazardous Waste Generators directory now lists 20,250 corporate 
discharges and polluters.
<p>
... The ravaging of the fish resources off the coasts of North 
America will have serious long-term effects.  U.S. Congressman 
Gerry Studds of Massachusetts, head of the Subcommittee on 
Fisheries of the House of Representatives, states ``Fishermen from 
Provincetown to New Bedford are fishing twice as long and twice as 
hard to catch half as many fish as they did at the start of the 
1980s, and according to scientists the prospects for the future 
are worse.''
<p>
This has occurred in this short space of time as a result of 
overfishing.  U.S. officials estimate that on Georges Bank, off 
the New England coast, overfishing has reduced the biomass of 
commercial groundfish, including, cod, haddock and flounder, more 
than 65% since 1977.
<p>
Canadian government scientists issued figures to show that 
fishermen were taking 45% of available Northern Cod every year rather 
than the 20% considered proper for maintenance of stock.  The 
scientists wanted a cut from 293,000 tons to 137,500 tons this 
year.  The Canadian government rolled this back to 258,000 tons.  
However, even this meagre cut resulted in scale-downs and plant-
closures which could effect 8,000 jobs this year in Newfoundland 
and Nova Scotia.  Again economic expediency was taking precedence 
over the long-term survival of a food-source fish -- and this kind 
of action is duplicated continually in Price System monetary 
consideration before action which would benefit the planet and 
those life forms inhabiting it, including us.
<p>
... In early August, 9,100 litres of a chemical, TCMTB, a highly 
toxic wood preservative, was spilled into the Fraser River in 
Surrey, B.C.  It coincided with the biggest sockey salmon run in 
76 years.  The river was closed to fishing while "tests" were 
carried out.  Next day it was re-opened, the tests were said to 
indicate that no damage had been done.  One wonders to what extent 
this decision was influenced by the large salmon run and the 
economic losses that would result from a lengthy closure.  Perhaps 
the level of contamination was small, but how much did it actually 
affect the fish, and, in turn, how much can be ingested by humans 
without affecting human health?  A little here, a bit more there -
- fruit, vegetables, meat, fish -- many of the foods we consume 
have some degree of contamination; add to this the contamination 
of the air we breathe and the water we drink, and this could cause 
a very insidious set of circumstances affecting the health of us 
all.
<p>
...We are rapidly destroying the ability of this planet to sustain 
life in its present form; this planet could well be unlivable in 
70 years if we continue on our present course.  In spite of all 
the warnings by people of knowledge in the community, we continue 
to give precedence to the <em>opinions</em> of politicians and 
businessmen, and allow our ``thinking'' to be influenced by the 
flashing of ``news'' on our T.V. sets and the often biased reporting 
as seen in our newspapers.
<p>
In 1758 David Hume wrote <cite>Of the First Principles of Government</cite>.
He said, ``Nothing appears more surprising to those who consider 
human affairs with a philosophical eye, than the easiness with 
which the many are governed by the few, and the implicit 
submission with which men resign their own sentiments and passions 
to those of their rulers.  When we inquire by what means this 
wonder is effected, we shall find that as Force is always on the 
side of the governed, the governors have nothing to support them 
but opinion.  It is therefore, on opinion only that government is 
founded, and this maxim extends to the most despotic and most 
military governments as well as to the free and most popular.''
<p>
This may have been nothing more than a philosophical excercise at 
the time it was written, and government by <cite>opinion</cite> did not cause 
any great harm.  In today's society it is extremely dangerous.  
Our highly complex technological civilization is capable of 
providing the high standard of life evident in North America, it 
is also quite capable of destroying all life if used incorrectly 
and if the present abuse of this technology continues for very 
much longer.  We need more than opinions -- we need highly 
informed rational decision, not based on what we think or would 
like.  We must administer our social mechanism on the basis of 
function, organizing our physical equipment in such a way as to 
bring the maximum benefit to all citizens, the greatest security 
commensurate with our present degree of knowledge, working toward 
the long-term survival of a high-energy civilization with the 
greatest protection to our environment.  All of this can be 
accomplished by the installation of Technocracy's design for 
functional governance.  Your investigation is welcome.
