<p>
Some 66 million years ago a planetesimal about 6 miles in diameter 
hit the earth with an awesome, stupendous force.  It was a 
disaster of trememdous magnitude.  Winds of 200 to 300 miles per 
hour raced over the surface of the earth, and some 90% of the 
forests burned.  The impact was probably accompanied by many 
erupting volcanoes, earthquakes and tidal waves of huge 
proportions.  Smoke filled the sky and the temperature plummeted.  
These physical changes created another great change:  They created 
one of the great mass extinctions of life on earth -- no animal 
weighing over 50 lbs. survived.
<p>
As far as can be determined, in terms of longevity, the dinosaurs 
were the most successful animal life-form ever to inhabit the 
earth; they had been on the earth for about 135 million years.  By 
comparison the human species is, at most, only about 4 million 
years old.
<p>
Today, a new disaster has hit the earth -- Man.
<p>
Technocracy Inc. has now been in existence long enough to see some 
of its worst fears comming to pass.  Technocracy warned that if we 
continued the attempt to maintain our Price System and its 
attendant social forms despite  the assault of technology and the 
application of the veritable tidal wave of energy necessary to run 
it, that we might very well be facing the very situation that we 
are facing today.
<p>
In 1980, a presidential commission in the U.S. estimated that in 
the following 20 years some 2 million species of plants and 
animals will become extinct, and 5 billion new acres of desert 
will have been created.
<p>
Man's mindless wasting of the Earth's bounty creates consequences 
not pleasant to contemplate.  6,000 sq. miles of forest are used 
up every year to furnish the Sunday edition of the New York Times; 
this requires 70 acres of trees.  At least 20.3 billion tons of 
topsoil per year was washed to the sea, mostly due to the 
destruction of ground cover.
<p>
Twenty years ago our worst fear was nuclear annihilation.  We 
knew that if the initial blast didn't kill us immediately, than we 
probably would face a slow and horrible death from radiation.  We 
now know that if we managed to escape both those terrors, then 
slow starvation from an ensuing nuclear winter would most surely 
be our fate.
<p>
Although most people in the world want peace and disarmament, we 
still do not have either peace or disarmament, and our generals 
still are planning and building for destruction:  The cost of the 
Trident II submarine and the F-18 fighter program equal the 
estimated cost of cleaning up the 10,000 worst hazardous-waste-
dumps in the U.S.  The cost of 6 month's outlay for nuclear 
warheads in fiscal year 1986 equaled all U.S. government 
expenditures for energy efficiency from 1980 to 1987.  Many such 
comparisons are possible; to try for any comfort in this 
ridiculous situation, we relax assuming that we will be safe as 
long as no one pulls the trigger!
<p>
But now -- we are confronted with a danger at least as big!  We 
are misusing our technology, and all we have to do to exceed past 
dangers is to continue doing what we have been doing in the past 
and our planet will become uninhabitable.  It is that serious.  
The ozone layer that surrounds the earth absorbs ultraviolet light 
from the sun.  It is this shield that makes life on earth 
possible. But the CFC (chlorofluorocarbon) compounds we are 
pumping into our atmosphere are destroying the earth's ozone 
layer.  The human species is, in effect, committing suicide!
<p>
25% of the CFC's (aerosol propellants) are used to pump material 
out of containers so that consumers won't have to open those 
containers or pump it out themselves.  The Price System's much 
vaunted "commercial competition" keeps business from stopping this 
practice.  The only really important function these compounds 
fullfill is in their use as refrigerants, and every single one of 
those compounds can be replaced by something not harmful.  This 
may happen as soon as business is sure of their competitive 
position.  The only reason those facts were not discovered earlier 
is becasuse no one cared to look.  Where is the profit in looking 
for danger?  But if we don't do something about this problem soon, 
no other problems will matter!  Most of the 70,000 toxins in 
commercial production are released into the environment without 
prior study.
<p>
Technocracy adopted the monad as its symbol, standing for a balance 
between man and his environment.  Today we are very far from any 
thing like balance.
<p>
Civilizations throughout history have collapsed for many reasons, 
and ignorance or simply ignoring the laws of nature is one very 
good reason.  They overshot the limits set by nature.
<p>
The civilization which occupied the valley of the Tigris and 
Euphrates Rivers was reputed to be the location of the Garden of 
Eden; it is now a desert.
<p>
The number of ways our civilization appears headed to its doom are 
almost too numerous to count, but let's try!
<ul>
  <li>1988 was the first year in history in which the U.S. did not 
      produce enough food for its own consumption.
  <li>Forest productivity in cubic meters per year per capita peaked 
      in 1967.
  <li>Fisheries productivity in kilograms of fish caught per year 
      per capita peaked in 1970.
  <li>Grasslands productivity is indicated by the figures for wool, 
      mutton and beef.  Wool production peaked in 1960, mutton in 1972 
      and beef in 1976.
  <li>Croplands productivity in kilograms of cereals per capita per 
      year peaked in 1976.
  <li>Annual world petroleum output per capita rose to an all time 
      high in 1977.
  <li>By burning huge amounts of carbon-based fuels in our cars, 
      airplanes and electric power plants, we are changing the 
      atmosphere's heat intake.
  <li>Between 1986 and 1988, production of food per capita fell 14% 
      dropping back to the level of 1970.
  <li>Much more will occur than a simple warming of climate.
</ul>
<p>
The Worldwatch Institute book, <cite>State of The World 1989</cite> states 
that:  ``Trees are adapted to a narrow range of temperature and 
moisture levels and cannot cope with rapid climate change. ...  
Vast numbers of trees are likely to die, and new trees adapted to 
warmer temperatures are unlikely to be able to replace them 
rapidly.  During such a disruption, huge areas of forest could 
die, and as they decay or burn, send large quantities of 
additional CO<sub>2</sub> into the atmosphere -- accelerating the greenhouse 
effect warming.''
<p>
What this means is that the cycle has positive feedback.  The 
warmer the climate becomes, the more trees will be destroyed, and 
they are the prime sources of oxygen and carbon fixation.
<p>
Exactly the same is true for the formation of deserts.  The causes 
of the formation of deserts is overgrazing, overcultivation, 
salinization and deforestation.  Once the ground cover is stripped 
off, the ground drys up and reflects much more of the sunlight 
back to the atmosphere.  This drys out the air so that less rain 
falls, and then the desert expands.
<p>
The five hottest years in this century were are all in the 1980s.  The 
greenhouse warming is well underway, and threatens to innundate 
much of the most productive agricultural land now in use and to 
turn much of what is left into desert.
<p>
As our population continues to grow exponentially, problems are 
magnified.  Annual growth currently adds 70 million to the earth's 
human population.  Something like a century ago Thomas Malthus 
predicted that population control would be by world-wide 
starvation.  He was called a merchant of gloom and doom or worse.  
American economist Daniel Raymond, in 1980, said of his ideas: 
``Although his (Malthus') theory is founded upon principles of 
nature, and although it is impossible to discover any flaws in his 
reasoning, yet the mind instinctively revolts at the conclusions 
to which he conducts it, and we are disposed to reject the theory, 
even though we are given no good reason.''  Today, ecomomists are 
rereading Malthus, not Raymond.
<p>
All the problems that we face today have solutions, or most of 
those solutions could be fairly quickly developed. For an example, 
in the field of energy:
<p>
Ecologically acceptable hydropower could quickly be developed
to replace coal and oil-burning plants.
<p>
The Continental Hydrology plan proposed by Technocracy over
50 years ago could be installed, slowing down and making
better use of our fresh water resources, recharging aquifers
and adding more plant life.
<p>
Geothermal power adds nothing to the atmosphere, and the
power potential is large.
<p>
Fuel cells can convert hydrocarbons to electricity much more
efficiently than the oil and coal-burning combustion systems
now in use.
<p>
There are many other ways to produce energy, all of them not as 
profitable to private enterprise as those presently used.
<p>
Problems have grown bigger and more unmanageable, problems that 
arose from living in a technologucal environment with methods of 
social control that did not fit the situation.  Examination of any 
of those problems can be gone into in greater depth than we have 
space for here, and, in every case, you will see that the 
influence on the problem by the Price System is negative.
<p>
None of those problems are likely to be met with more than token 
solutions as long as we have a Price System under which one's 
frantic interest is profit and the quarterly bottom line.  We, 
all of us, need Technocracy.
