FULL EMPLOYMENT has been widely ballyhooed as a corollary of 
prosperity and social well-being.  It is the hope of the 
politician, and almost full employment is the hope of the 
businessman and industrialist.  It is also a desirable social 
condition from the viewpoint of the moralist.  Furthermore, full 
employment is in agreement with the social objectives of the 
engineer, but not in the same sense as for the other three.
<p>
The politician in office wants full employment for his 
constituents. Full employment means that they are all getting an 
income and are thus able to pay taxes.  It also keeps them out of 
mischief, especially the kind of mischief that leads to social 
change or even to a change of political administrators.  
Employment stabilizes people in an area so they do not move around 
and learn as much about what is going on elsewhere.  There is 
nothing like full employment to tranquilize the people, and a 
placid population is highly desirable to the politician.
<p>
The businessman wants full employment, but not quite.  Employed 
people mean customers with money, and what good is business 
without customers with money?  But the businessman wants just 
enough unemployment so that he can be choosy about the employees 
he selects for his business.  In other words, if employees are 
relatively abundant, their price value goes down and there is a 
wider choice.  Few things irk a businessman more than to have a 
scarcity of available employees, which means that he has to take 
what he can get and has to pay them high wages.
<p>
The moralist wants full employment because full employment means 
that people are earning a "virtuous" living and have more money to 
contribute to the collection plate and to the charity drives.  But 
he does not want them to have a very high income, otherwise, they 
might begin to enjoy this life too much and not look forward with 
enough eagerness to the hereafter.
<p>
Politicians have promised the American people full employment -- 
in the near future and around some corner -- maybe.  This is not, 
however, an inconceivable goal considering the politician's 
capacity for creating boondoggling employment.  But, we ask, why 
should upwards of half the working population be employed at jobs 
that are not socially beneficial?  It matters little whether these 
created jobs are strictly make-work relief projects, whether they 
are in unnecessary government employment or whether they are in 
government subsidized enterprise.  They are, for the part, 
socially wasteful occupations financed by government credit.  
Boondoggling might be considered a socially useful activity only 
if the welfare of the society demanded that everyone be fully 
employed.  But, if work is considered merely as a means of 
production, and not as an end in itself, there is not much to be 
said in favor of boondoggling.
<p>
The engineer has a different concept of full employment.  To an 
engineer, full employment means the balanced-load operation of all 
energy-consuming devices in the area at a high load factor.  When 
the principal energy-consuming device employed to do man's work 
was the human engine, with a per capita rating of one-tenth 
horsepower or less, there was something to be said in favor of 
full employment for the human being.  In those days, the only way 
to produce more was to work more human beings longer.  Toil was 
essential to survival.
<p>
But there has been a fundamental change in the type of energy-
consuming device used in production and service.  The first shift 
away from the human engine was the employment of other kinds of 
animal engines, such as horses and oxen.  Even the dog came in for 
a share of this energy conversion.  But, so long as men and 
animals were employed to do the work, it was impossible to 
concentrate enough power in one place to do a really big job.  
When such a job was attempted, it usually bogged down in the face 
of the tremendous task of maintaining the engines, of which fuel 
(food) was the principal item.
<p>
<h3>Changes In Operation</h3>
<p>
With the successful development of the steam engine, the 
concentration of power was advanced.  Much bigger jobs could be 
contemplated.  The cost of maintenance went down.  The bulk or 
mass of the engine per horsepower became less, and the factor of 
fatigue that plagued the human engine was eliminated.
<p>
Something else also happened.  This was a change in the mode of 
production and management.  When the human being was the principal 
prime mover, only a small amount of work gravitated to him.  This 
meant that the typical enterprise was in or around the home.  When 
the steam engine was set up, a larger amount of work gravitated to 
the site of the engine.  As a consequence, factories came into 
being; and the human engine moved to the factory to serve merely 
as a secondary energy-consuming device to supplement the work of 
the principal prime mover, the steam engine.  When internal 
combustion engines and hydroelectric power entered the social 
scene, man became still less important as a prime mover.  Today, 
he is doing less than two percent of the work being done in 
manufacturing industries.
<p>
As power became concentrated into larger units, industrial 
enterprises became larger and tended toward monopoly controls.  
The free individual enterprise of the human-toil era gave way to 
corporate enterprise which soon began to sabotage free enterprise 
and individual initiative.  Corporate enterprise despised free 
competition and set out to abolish it.  If you doubt these 
statements, we challenge you to venture forth with the objective 
of starting up a new enterprise unit in competition with some 
established corporation.  Based on the testimony of numerous 
disillusioned free enterprisers, these are some of the 
interferences that you will encounter:
<p>
In the first place, the politicians who are in the pay of 
corporate enterprise, will stagnate you with license fees and 
permit requirements.  Then you will run up against the problem of 
getting materials, supplies and services, which will be almost 
impossible to obtain once your more powerful competitor learns of 
your ambition and uses his influence.  Then you will run into 
marketing difficulties.  Distributors will be warned by corporate 
enterprise not to handle your product.  But supposing you survive 
all these hazards and do threaten to become a successful 
competitor; you will be bought out by your competitor and thus 
cease to be competition.  That is the main purpose of cartel 
combines -- the abolition of competition.  This is, however, 
another story and does not concern us so much at this time.
<p>
Since the human being constitutes but a minor fraction of the 
energy-converting capacity of this Continent, he can be all but 
ignored in the technological design for full employment.  As a 
prime mover, his rating is so low, his cost so high, and his 
behavior so unreliable that every time he can be displaced by an 
electric motor or engine an advance in efficiency, productivity 
and quality follows.  So the technological design for full 
employment would reduce human toil to a minimum and employ more 
kilowatt-hours.
<p>
A high-energy, balanced load operation is the central idea in the 
technological design of social operations.  The engineer would see 
that energy is utilized in the most efficient way so as to meet 
the requirements of abundant living for the whole population.  
Then he would smooth out the oscillations to an even, balanced 
load, operating 24 hours per day and 365 day per year.  Surplus 
and inefficient equipment would be reconverted into scrap or 
something else more useful.  The human engine, in so far as is 
possible, would be retired from productive employment.
<p>
Thus, we would have full employment of the most efficient energy 
converters on the Continent.  This would result in a level of 
production which is impossible when a low-power, low-efficiency 
converter like the human engine is used.  More goods and services 
would be available to the population and the human being would 
have much more time and opportunity for self-expression and 
enjoyment of living.
<p>
Politicians will not like this form of full employment.  Their 
capacity for control of energy-consuming devices is limited to the 
control of inefficient human engines.  The control of a high-
horsepower engine calls for a technician, not a politician.  So, 
politicians would have to fade out of the social picture in fovor 
of those far more informed and far better qualified.
<p>
Businessmen will not like this form of full employment either 
since business is geared to the distribution of a scarcity.  More 
efficient production would mean the end of scarcity and, hence, of 
business.
<p>
The moralists may not like it, for they would have to develop a 
dynamic new philosophy of living and place less emphasis on an 
escapist philosophy based on the concept of misery in this life 
and abundance and leisure hereafter.
<p>
<h3>A New Leadership</h3>
<p>
These old leaders must give way to a new leadership which is 
already here.  The advance in science and technology during the 
past few decades has completely changed the conditions under which 
we live.  The scientists, the technologist and the engineer must 
come forth and take the responsibility which social change is 
thrusting upon them.  They must volunteer for this job or the 
march of events will require that they be drafted.
<p>
There are many people who cannot grasp this new concept of full 
employment, even after it has been carefully explained to them.  
Their thinking is still stifled with the superstition that man 
must work "to earn a living."  And these people will insist on 
asking this question:  "How will people be able to buy the 
abundance that is possible if they don't work to earn the money?"  
It is almost as futile to attempt an answer to this question -- 
one which the people who ask it can comprehend -- as it is to 
attempt teaching calculus to a moron.  But we shall make an 
effort.
<p>
<h3>Our Stake In North America</h3>
<p>
Work is done in order to provide goods and services for human 
beings.  There is little that can be said for work merely for 
work's sake.  So, work is necessary only that these goods and 
services may be produced.  The more work, the more goods and 
services available, everything else being essentially equal.  Man, 
himself, cannot do enough work with his one-tenth horsepower to 
provide more than a minimum standard of living.  So, in order to 
produce enough goods for a high standard of living, technology 
must be employed.  Since technology is so much more efficient than 
man, it is fitting that man be retired and other engines employed 
to do the work.  That accounts for the production end of the 
problem.
<p>
Since goods and services are of little use unless they are 
consumed by human beings, the next step is one of distribution to 
the consumer.  Manpower does so little of the work that it would 
be foolish to attempt dividing up the purchasing power on the 
basis of the human energy expended.  In any case, it would not be 
adequate to purchase the goods produced by machines, even if much 
higher wages were paid.  Furthermore, it would not provide a 
satisfactory means of getting purchasing power to all consumers.  
How about the children, the sick, the aged and the physically 
handicapped, for example?  Obviously, a new basis of distribution 
must be used.
<p>
As North American citizens, we all have a stake in the Continent.  
This stake entitles us as a right of citizenship to a share of 
what this Continent produces, in the same way as a stockholder in 
a corporation is now entitled to a share of what the corporation 
produces, not on a basis of ownership rights.  Things get out of 
balance when a few successful manipulators are able to accumulate 
ownership rights over most of the Continent and its produce, while 
the great majority of citizens are swindled out of their 
birthright.  Therefore, adequate distribution means that equitable 
ownersuip rights in this Continent must be reestablished for all 
of its citizens.  Then they will be able to draw upon the 
productive capacity for their respective shares of the produce.
<p>
The only problem then is to balance production and consumption -- 
produce what the people want to consume in the quantities that 
satisfy their wants -- and distribute it to the places where it is 
to be consumed.  Technocracy's Energy Accounting System is 
designed to to accomplish these functions.
<p>
Technocracy Inc. has produced the only design for full employment, 
full production and full consumption yet offered to the people of 
North America.  The politicians, the businessmen and the moralists 
cannot provide any of these.  The most they can do is provide full 
employment for human beings, that is, if boondoggling, waste-work 
expenditures of human energy can be called full employment.  But, 
they cannot provide full employment for the technology of this 
Continent.  If they attempted it, the productivity would be so 
great that it would completely ruin the Price System.
<p>
<h3>We Must Choose</h3>
<p>
One argument that always comes up is based on the erroneous 
assumption that "things have been as they are for hundreds of 
years; so, why don't we keep them that way and let well enough 
alone?"  It would hardly seem necessary to point out that things 
are not as they were for hundreds of years.  The large-scale use 
of technolopgy is scarcely a hundred years old, and most of it has 
been developed in the last 50 years.  It is this use of energy 
through technology that is producing social change.
<p>
Since Technocracy has the only blueprint for full employment in 
the only sense that makes any sense, it behooves all North 
Americans to investigate its program and to demand that it be 
installed.  We do not have the choice of going on as we are.  We 
must choose science and security or political compromise and 
chaos. The latter, of course, is not a choice but downright social 
suicide.  It is just that serious, and that is why Technocrats are 
so persistent in their effort to get this knowledge to the North 
American people.
