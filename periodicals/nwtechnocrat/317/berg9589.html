Different pairs of eyes can look at the same thing and see that 
thing differently depending on the level of education, experience 
or mental ability of the owner of those eyes.  The report to others 
of what was seen can vary too, depending on the viewer's emotional 
state and, then too, on his estimation of the ability of his 
audience to understand.  Not long ago, John Glenn said one vivid 
experience as an astronaut was his realization that the 
atmospheric envelope that surrounds the earth was so very thin.  
He might well have stayed on that topic, perhaps throwing a little 
light on society's desperate need to better understand a few 
physical facts about the precarious position of all life on earth.
<p>
Perhaps that revelation of John Glenn's came to him because, in his 
experience as an airplane pilot, he had grown accustomed to 
thinking of distance -- great distances that could be traversed in 
a very short time.  But here he was, as an astronaut, traversing a 
great distance in a vertical direction -- and quickly.  It didn't 
take but seconds to leave the blanket of our atmosphere and then 
to be in the sterile realm of space.
<p>
Fifteen or twenty miles horizontally is perceived by most of us as 
a small distance, but that same small distance vertically seems 
great. Perhaps that is why we have blindly assumed that our air 
is a great, endless, sewer-like receptacle into which we can safely 
continue to pour our noxious gasses forever.  But such is not 
correct; that receptacle is becoming plugged; it does have limits, 
and it is the same air that we must breathe to live.
<p>
Air is not brand-new, manufactured and guaranteed new and fresh 
for us to breathe.  Instead, it has been here for millions of 
years, recycled over and over by nature and given to us and to all 
life to use and enjoy, but there isn't the abundance of it that we 
first thought.  How we use it is up to us, and we must taste, 
smell and breathe the result of our management of that limited 
resource -- air.
<p>
Because we have gotten accustomed to the rules of the Price 
System, over the long centuries, we have not questioned those 
rules except to insist upon modifications and reforms that are 
really merely different applications of the same old thing.  
Communism, fascism, socialism and other brands of the ancient 
Price System have been tried with the same result -- they do not 
meet the new situation that is created by technology.  They were 
brought into existence to distribute a scarcity, but are incapable 
of operating technology satisfactorily in today's conditions.  We 
may have to learn this the hard way -- by literally choking on it.
<p>
We must awaken to the fact that the cause of what we choke on is 
created by the Price System, and no token reform by politics or 
business will be sufficient to avoid the dangers involved in its 
perpetuation; it will rob us of life itself if we let it.
<p>
We can abandon our inept handling of technology by adopting  
scientifically managed social system -- we can then live our lives 
with the enhanced opportunity for a better life, instead of in a 
foolish pursuit of profit.  We can do this, but only if we realize   
what it is that we must do to embark upon a course of action that 
intelligently manages those factors that give us life.  One of 
those factors is air!
