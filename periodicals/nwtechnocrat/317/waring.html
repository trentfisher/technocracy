<p>
The raw materials required to produce the volume of finished products
-- foods, clothes, housing and other buildings with everything in
them, transportation, communications, etc. -- for the average man,
woman and child, in North America every year adds up to nearly 19
tons.
<p>
The conversion of all these natural resources into consumer-usable
products in industrial North America is completely measurable at every
stage of production, and we should remember production is utterly
dependent on the efficient use of technologically produced energy and
not on such concepts as money, price and debt.  This is a fact of
vital importance to the people of this entire Continental area.
<p>
This is because our survival as living human beings, the direction of
our individual social way of life, and the Continental statesmanship
required for our future are all bound up in the functional
coordination of our resources with our technology on a dynamic and
balanced load basis.  People who understand how to measure with ergs
and kilogram-calories, horsepower-hours, kilowatt-hours of energy as
the prime planning and operational measurement unit for implementation
of Continental policy decisions must be the ones, considering the
essential needs of each and every individual citizen in North
America.
<p>
When it is realized that this functional order involves the balancing
of 10,500,000 sq. miles of area, with its renewable and non-renewable
resources to be conserved and processed with some 35,000,000,000
mechanical-electrical horsepower, the magnitude of this applied
science, engineering and agro-biological responsibility is not easily
envisioned.
<p>
That the preceding is wholly alien to any Price System training is
obvious.  The Price System demands that we consider money, price,
debt, economics, finance, banking, business, crime, philanthropy,
propaganda, advertising, government, political ideology and other
notions that are entirely useless and incompetent for the production
of anything, serving only to adroitly interfere with our human needs.
The system is now reaching for its ultimate misuse of science and
technology.  This is a concern that is vital to our security.
<p>
Considering per-capita averages, some people get inordinately more,
many somewhat less, of the benefits of this 19 ton and 330
horsepower-hour average, since our present social system
differentiates between human beings on the arbitrary and meaningless
basis of the number of little green rectangles of paper that each
person owns and controls.  The raw material figures given here
represent the amounts of natural resources required to keep an average
person at his or her present standard of living for one year.  These
are the basics, together with all that is wasted by the system. If we
multiply by 75, we can compute annual figures and obtain the tonnage
of mined and grown materials -- mainly from domestic sources (North
American), but some imported -- that would be required in order to
provide for a whole life-span, according to present expectancy (at
birth) estimates.
<p>
Some people assume that the mines and wells contain unlimited deposits
of minerals and that the farmland will replenish its bounty
unceasingly.  Such is plainly impossible.  Notwithstanding the facts
of nature, policy and planning through the entire 19th century
proceeded with such expectations.  Some Wall Street firms guilessly
issued industrial bonds with due dates in the early 2100s!
<p>
Expansion must be maintained at all costs, as the U.S. Price System
learned the hard way in the 1930s.
If the "costs" are in human lives wasted and mineral resources
blasted, as in World Wars I and II, Korea and Vietnam; but that cannot
concern the U.S. Price System -- the dollar dictates decision.
<p>
Political government, and not just a mere administration, is entirely
dependent on the financial stability of the system.  We give you an
example:  Upwards of a quarter billion cubic-feet of natural gas fuel
is legally flared, vented into the air, gone forever, for the
commercial reason that it is too cheap to conserve -- every
twenty-four hours year round.  In the 1930s, 40s and 50s, when the
retail and wholesale price of gas was much lower than now, the flaring
of gas at U.S. oil and gas fields averaged 1,500,000,000 cubic-feet
every twenty-four hours, year after year.  This was the Price System's
"law" as set by State and Federal politicians who were subservient to
the system's oil and gas lobbyists.  Natural gas is now the scarcest
of U.S. fuel energy resources in terms of years' supply remaining.
(All data from U.S. Bureau of Mines published reports.)
<p>
We have another example of waste:  A daily average of 232,500 tons
(1975-85 average) of dissolved solids, much of it topsoil that was
allowed to be washed and drained off midwest and prairie farms, flows
down the Mississippi River by Vicksburg, Miss. and out to the Gulf of
Mexico.  The daily average of dissolved solids going down the Columbia
River past the hydrologic station at The Dalles, near Warrendale,
Ore., averages 31,100 tons.
(All data from U.S. Geological Survey published reports).  These
figures amount to one ton per person every day for the U.S. and
Canada, a daily drain that is attributable to the Price System that we
foolishly allow to rule us.  The hamstrung U.S. Soil Conservation
Service and its Canadian counterpart are merely examples of Price
System bureaucratic fronts, like the Environmental Protection
Administration, giving the public the illusion of resource
conservation while their competent professionals are virtually
prevented from performing functionally.
<p>
In stark contrast to the massive unemployment and bankruptcies of the
1930s, the U.S. participation in World War II used up 5,000,000,000
tons of U.S. non-renewable minerals.
Those resources were mined and processed largely for military
destruction, and every ton was profitable.  So prosperous was this
stimulus to the U.S. Price System's financial health that it has been
continued for 41 years, nominally under the propaganda prop of a
pseudo "Cold War."  Close to $3 trillion dollars has been pump-primed
into the U.S. Gross National Product (G.N.P.) in these last four
decades through annual military budgets -- all under the profitably
conterfeit Cold War guise of bogus anti-communism.  What this means is
that the private enterprise "Free Market Economy" loudly proclaimed as
the ideal form of Price System ideology (what we are ostensibly arming
to "defend") actually became moribund in the North American scene
around the years 1932-33.
<p>
Some of North America's most vital resources are being diverted for
military use, wasted in Price System stupidity:  Very little is left
of the millions of tons of U.S. deposits of such as Antimony,
Beryllium, Bismuth, Cadmium, Germanium, Fluorspar, Mercury, Platinum,
Tantalum, ilmenite and rutile ores for Titanium, Tungsten and other
metals; to say nothing of the Copper, Lead, Zinc and Iron ore.
<p>
The foregoing, together with the chart that follows this article
should be considered when people discuss such topics as family
planning, population control and peace.
<p>
Technocracy spelled out the potential for an economy of abundance in
North America years ago.  What we had then has been plundered, wasted
and spoiled to a point where we now have less of a chance to make the
most of a wonderful continent.  We have been handed a social idea that
will enable us to shape a heritage to be proud of; let's get to it!

  <dd>Metals and Fuels are averages of 1983 thru 1985 figures
      from U.S. Bureau of Mines and U.S. Geological Survey.
      Organic Renecables are averages of 1982 and 1985 figures from
      Crop Reporting Services, Forest Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture.
      Approxemately equivalent figures equate Canada's per capita use
      of natural resources with those living in the United States,
      thus aggregating the average per capita standard of living
      currently in technological North America.
