Humans have in some cases been prone to create havoc on the Earth, 
and their tendency to desecrate and ruin things has been an 
occasional behaviorism throughout the long history of Man.  But it 
is only now in these last few years that the bad effects of Man's 
careless behavior toward the earth has become so rapacious that it 
is becoming a problem of actual survival of the human species and 
of other life as well.
<p>
When Man's numbers were few and his technology primitive, he could 
pretty much do as he pleased and the earth could repair the injury 
to natural systems.  Now, however, things are different -- Man has 
become numerous and has developed the effectiveness of his 
technology to the point where he endangers his own survival.  Let 
us cite a few examples.
<p>
The oceans are not an inexhaustible source of food for man to 
plunder.  They can be overfished and poisoned.  The oceans can be 
denied the part the wetlands play in their life; the oceans, too, 
can become a desert.  Indeed, the wetlands, according to what some 
biologists suspect, are the fountainhead of the life of the ocean.  
Those little organisms that grow in that mud could very well be 
the beginning of the food chain that ends with us.  Yet, we are 
paving, draining, dredging and destroying in every way what may 
very well be something of value to us.  Nature seems to be ``in the 
way of progress.''
<p>
Our plentiful supply of water isn't so plentiful any more.  It has 
been diverted to irrigating huge tracts of land, and salt, 
downstream draught and, perhaps, uncontrollable and irreversible 
land changes are the result.  Cities have been built expecting 
water to come from somewhere; and it has, so far, but in lots of 
cases, only with great difficulty.
<p>
The Aral sea, one of the largest landlocked bodies of water in the 
world, in southwestern U.S.S.R., has shrunk to less than two 
thirds its previous size, and the volume of water has been reduced 
by 60 percent.  The water level has dropped 377 feet and is 
falling over 3 feet per year.  The sea's coastline has receded 
about 120 statute miles.  And the salt content is now more than 
two and one-half times the previous nine grams per liter.  Soviet 
officials state that the ecological losses exceed several times 
over those resulting from the Chernobyl disaster.
<p>
The two rivers that fed into the Aral sea have been reduced to a 
trickle because the water which once irrigated only 2.9 million 
hectares of land now irrigate 7.2 million. [a hectare is equal to 
2.471 acres].  In addition, those rivers are polluted by soil 
salts, defoliants, insecticides, chemical fertilizers, industrial 
waste and sewage discharges.  The three million people who live in 
the area are consequently suffering health problems: increased 
infant mortality, cancer of the esophagus, hepatitis and stomach 
disorders.
<p>
Water is going to be a source of argument in the Near East.  Syria 
is upstream from Israel, and Turkey has already upped its use of 
the water needed by Iraq and Syria.  The increase in population 
causes a pressure that is increasing.  Egypt, whose only water is 
the Nile has an exploding population as well.  With water 
problems, a diminishing food-producing land area and that 
exploding population problem; there are grim prospects ahead, 
indeed.
<p>
The land areas of Earth have not had the careful stewardship they 
have needed.  Increases in population have pressed on nature -- 
perhaps past the point of no-return, and deserts now exist or are 
forming where they need not be.  The tonnage of top-soil that 
flows down rivers or is blown to where it cannot be used is 
astronomical.  Agro-biological decisions must not be made by 
farmers in pursuit of the dollar; a wider, better educated vision 
is required.
<p>
The San Joaquin and Imperial Valleys in California, whose farms 
are increasingly owned by corporations, are run largely by managers 
who must produce -- dollars.  The care of the land could be vastly 
improved, but techniques that could be implemented to save the 
land are prevented from being used by Price System factors.
<p>
Well meaning advisers to African people in some cases caused them 
to abandon their pastoral life-style and adopt agriculture, a poor 
idea.  Other western-world practices and influence was largely 
responsible for a poplation explosion that, in the Sahel, caused 
an increased need for firewood that was, in turn, responsible for 
denuding a forest, which then brought on desert.
<p>
An exploding population in Asia has brought on practices which 
result in famine, floods and pressure on the earth's ability to 
rejuvenate itself.
<p>
When we speak of plunder, the idea is implicit that there are some 
"goodies" taken,  Is that really the case?  Did the public enjoy a 
long-term benefit?  We think not.  One piece of plunder was 
nuclear-fission power-generation.  One would think that the 
consequences of our acts would occurr to someone.  But can you 
recall anyone even suggesting that the decommissioning of a 
nuclear power plant would involve such herculean effort and such 
danger?  Now we have 360 nuclear reactors to decommission in the 
next 25 years with no safe place to put the scrap.  Remember, that 
scrap is radioactive and will be deadly for a longer time than 
words can describe.
<p>
Meanwhile, we really aren't working very hard at developing a non-
polluting substitute; it must be profitable before we really get 
to it.
<p>
There are responsible people who are beginning to talk of a world-
wide control of those factors which threaten the survival of our 
species.  We are quite sure that such talk will increase and 
possibly have positive results.  But North Americans are in a 
unique position; they are in a position to take a step upward in 
their method of social operation and become an example for the 
rest of the world.  The problems of this planet are difficult 
problems; they seem to be insoluble problems.  But, no matter how 
well-intentioned people are, if they try to resolve difficult 
problems with a further application of what caused the problems in 
the first place, they will meet failure.
<p>
The Price System method of social operation is not compatible 
with technology, and the social problems we see today derive from 
attempts to solve such problems by innappropriate techniques.  A 
Technate may not save many of the World's people from a terrible 
fate; things may have gone too far, but it will be the best we can 
do -- for them and for ourselves.
