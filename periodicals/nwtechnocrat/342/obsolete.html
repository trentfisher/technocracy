Why would politicians and economists ask North Americans
to believe that technology makes more jobs for people when it so obviously
doesn't?  Don't they know any better, or do they deliberately distort
the facts?  The reality is that the facts concerning this subject
can be verified quite easily by anyone who can read and is willing
to do a small amount of research in the local public library.  Technology
displaces many of the man-hours of human labor required per unit of
production, and even in the service industry, typewriters, adding
machines, computers, etc. are reducing man-hours at an ever increasing
rate.
<p>
When one considers the thousands of items produced, the thousands
of services now available and the ability to produce them so much
faster then in pre-technological days, the only conclusion possible
is that much more can be produced per man-hour than ever before.  Such
an increase in efficiency could never have occurred except by the
use of technology.  What would be the point in using technology if
this wasn't so?
<p>
Anyone, even politicians and economists, can simply consult
the Statistical Abstract of the U.S. and the Historical Statistics
of the U.S. to find the trends showing the increasing efficiency of
man-hours and see the obvious difference between the ability to produce
in pre-technological days compared to that of today.  Anyone who
can't understand this subject certainly shouldn't try to be a source
of information for anyone.
<p>
Many North Americans are old enough to remember farmers working
from sun-up to sun-set then doing barnyard chores until full dark.  They
can remember working 66 hours per week at a payroll job before the
NRA required the 40 hour work-week in an attempt to "spread the work"
to reduce unemployment.  More technology was installed and unemployment
persisted until WWII took many out of the regular job market thus
allowing unemployment to decline, and still we produced more than
ever before.
<p>
According to Historical Statistics of the U.S., people working
for pay worked 12 hours per day in 1640, (72 hours for a 6 day week).  From
the same source one finds that, in 1934, the work-week was 34.6 hours;
this would be less than 1/2 the pre-technological level.  Since 1934,
(depression days) the average working hours per week for full-time
jobs has been kept at higher levels than necessary for some, creating
unemployment or part-time work for others.
<p>
Just when did the technological age begin anyway?  Few records
were kept in those days, so we must use what we have.  In 1790, only
3 patents were issued, so one must conclude that the technological
age  began after that -- perhaps in 1800 when 41 were issued.  In
1970, 64,427 were issued and, in 1992, the number was 107,400.  With
the widespread use of computer controlled technology, now in use and
increasing rapidly, working hours per unit of production will continue
to decline at a faster pace than ever before.  The "downsizing" will
continue as more efficient technology is applied.
<p>
In 1790, farming was the only industry that was widespread
across the Continent with an estimated 95 percent of the population
living on farms.  So, in order to compare present efficiency with
that of 1790, we must be concerned with farming efficiency.  Farm
productivity, or the number of persons who could be supplied by one
farmer, according to Historical Statistics was 4.1 persons in 1820.  By
1970, that number had increased to 47.1 persons supplied by one farmer.  By
1990, U.S. farm employment had dropped to 2,891,000 and the total
population had increased to 248.8 million.  Therefore, it would appear
that one farmer could, in 1990, supply 86 people (assuming that as
much was exported as was imported).  At this rate of increase, if
extended backward from 1820 to 1790 the number supplied by one farmer
would be about 2.  One can only conclude that the ability to produce
on the farm has increased by 40 times and this would seem to be a
conservative figure.  This idea is further authenticated by the population
increase from 3.9 million in 1790 to 248.8 million in 1990 at the
same time the number of farm workers decreased from 12,146,000 in
1910 to 2,891,000 in 1990.  To put it another way, the population
has INCREASED by 63.8 times since 1790 while the number of farmers
has DECREASED by 4.18 times since 1910.
<p>
Just where did all the people working in non-farm industries
come from when 71.8 percent of the labor force lived on farms in 1820?  They
came from farms by the thousand as technology eliminated the need
for them on farms.  That is why an industrial society became possible.  And
as industrial production became more efficient as a result of technology,
the service industry became possible.  Does one need the statistics
concerning the increased efficiency due to technology in the production
and service industries to understand that technology replaces human
labor per unit of production?  These statistics can also be found
in Historical Statistics and the Statistical Abstract of the U.S.  Help
yourself; they are in your local public library.
<p>
Statistics prove the increasing ability to produce was a
result of technology beyond even the smallest doubt.  For example:  The
total horsepower of all prime movers in the U.S. has increased from
8.5 million in 1950 to 34,958.0 million in 1990 -- an increase
of 4,115 times. (See Historical Statistics of the U.S. Colonial Times
to 1970, page 818 and the Statistical Abstract of the U.S. 1993 edition,
page 572).  With a 1995 total of more than 35 billion horsepower,
the U.S. has the extraneous energy available to produce as much as
350 billion people working at a rate of 1/10 horsepower.  This means
that 61.4 times the world's present population of 5.7 billion would
be required to produce as much as the U.S. alone.
<p>
For all practical purposes, no prime-movers existed before
the technological age except for farm animals, a few crude water wheels,
and humans themselves.  A strong man working several hours per day
could, at best, provide 1/10 horsepower.  Very few working farm animals
even exist today in the U.S. and the water wheels are certainly no
longer crude.
<p>
Since the population increased from 152.7 million in 1950
to 263.2 million in 1995, the per capita increase in the horsepower
of prime-movers was 38.46 times.  However, 1950 was long after the
beginning of the technological age, so the increase from colonial
times has to be far more than 40 times.
<p>
With 35 billion horsepower of prime-movers in the U.S., and
with 263.2 million people, the number of horsepower available per
capita would be 133.  That would be equal to 1,330 slaves working
for each U.S. citizen.  We note here that a study of Canadian statistics
would reveal a similar condition.
<p>
<EM>Note:</EM> A prime-mover, according to Webster, "is a machine, such
as a water-wheel or steam-engine, which receives and modifies energy
as supplied by some natural source."
<p>
Therefore, prime-movers are the "engines" which convert all
the energy that supplies all the power needed to operate all the
technology.  Prime-movers,
and the energy they convert, are the basis of all technological activity.
<p>
Very few modern industries even existed in pre-technological
days; the automobile, radio, TV, airplanes, computers, are examples.  So,
the totals produced in these industries are 100 percent greater than
before technology.  In fact, without technology they wouldn't have
been possible.
<p>
<h3>Just what is the significance of all this?</h3>
<p>
First: It means that with one-half the working hours and
with more than 40 times the ability to produce, the North American
social mechanism is capable of providing plenty of everything produced
to every citizen on this Continent.  We have omitted a discussion
of all the planned obsolescence and shoddy goods produced to increase
sales, the duplication of effort, loans and "gifts" to foreign countries,
payments to farmers to produce less, etc.  With all this ability to
produce, we must ask why more than 30 million Americans live in poverty
and at least another 30 million live only slightly better?  We, the
citizens of this Continent, have failed to educate ourselves concerning
our own ability to produce.  Poverty in the midst of plenty on this
Continent can only be the result of our unwillingness to do a little
research in order to understand our own condition.
<p>
Second: It means that people who say that technology makes
more jobs for people are passing out information which couldn't be
further from the facts.  The increase in jobs that has occurred in
the past century, or so, has been due to an expanding economy resulting
from an increase in population and debt -- plus having started this
expansion from a condition of extreme scarcity with an expanding economy
that could never have grown so fast, and so far, without the rapidly
increasing technology.
<p>
Third: As more and better technology is installed, an ever
faster growing economy is necessary to maintain employment, and working
hours must be reduced, or some combination of both are required.  In
today's economy, purchasing power is distributed chiefly as a reward
for human labor.  In recent history, unemployment insurance, welfare,
food stamps and subsidies of various kinds have been added as the
need for human labor per-unit-of-production has declined.  Otherwise,
enough purchasing power couldn't have been distributed to keep the
economy going, and a depression would have been the result.
<p>
Fourth: In order to maintain growth, an ever-increasing use
of natural resources with a resulting deterioration of the environment
must occur.  As resources decline, living standards will also decline
and the population will be reduced, or both.
<p>
Fifth: Since the population growth in the U.S. and Canada
is already slowing, and since we no longer have the extreme scarcity
of previous centuries, the expansion of the economy must slow down,
or a faster increase of the debt will be required to finance a faster
growth of the economy.
<p>
When we are willing, and able, to admit that all these things
can't be done, we must also then admit that we must make the necessary
effort to design and install an entirely new economic system, with
a new economic control technique.  This can't be done without the
research that should have been a major effort for at least the past
50 years.
<p>
The most notable aspect of this technological age is that
it allows us to produce the greatest quantity of goods and services
in all of human history.  But this creates an overwhelming problem,
the inability to distribute the plenty we can already produce with
an economic system designed for an age of scarcity.
<p>
We keep trying to maintain scarcity, because the Price System
demands that goods and services remain scarce.  Our vain efforts to
preserve this failing system can only result in social deterioration,
and these problems can only grow in intensity and danger until events
hurt us enough to force us to make a change.  When that time comes,
and if it's not too late to save the environment, we can then have
an age of both peace and plenty.
<p>
If, and as, economic problems are solved, we can learn to
live, with a reduction of man-hours to less than one-half of present
levels, rather than spending so much time learning to make a living
in a cruelly competitive system.
<p>
There are events which have and are occurring at an increasing
rate since technology became an important factor in our physical
operations.  They
are physical events, occurring in the physical world, and are subject
to the same laws of nature as any other physical event; they must
be understood and controlled as such.  They certainly can't be controlled
on the basis of a system of beliefs and opinions about things and
events which can't be understood and are unknowable.  Beliefs, opinions,
traditions and prejudice are irrelevant in the operation of
technology.  Technology
MUST be operated in a physical world by the use of factual information.  The
only alternative is chaos.  Our physical world is changing rapidly,
and if we can't change our economic world, which is based on beliefs
and opinions, then we must accept the results of our choice, a world
of unprecedented hardship.  If we are able to make the necessary mental
changes we can have a world of peace and plenty, at least on this
Continent -- and it is on this Continent that this change must
occur first.
<p>
Economic problems already developing are demanding a new
age, an age which can't exist with present political-economic methods.  Work,
human work, is becoming obsolete and we must change our methods of
distribution to match the new conditions.  We are not prepared for
such an age due to the misinformation being presented to this Continent's
citizens -- misinformation such as that stupid myth about technology
making more jobs for people.  To be prepared we must understand the
situation we face, and to understand it sufficiently we must be willing
to do the research required.  This new age will not be possible until
we make it possible.  The incentive to do so is being provided by
the increasing problems that are resulting from our inability to understand
them.  We suggest that the fastest method for understanding is a study
of Technocracy's Technological Social Design, a design resulting from
75 years of research and study of the subject.  It is long past the
time for the citizens of this Continent to do their own thinking;
and if we have the intelligence, then we should use it.  However,
the facts are needed for accurate thinking, and those facts can only
be obtained from research.  We can do it now, or wish we had later.
