<p>
In 1543 Copernicus, a Catholic priest,  produced a mathematical paper
disproving the crystal sphere theories of Ptolemy that had held sway for
hundreds of years.  Ptolemy's theory of how the heavens worked held that the
Earth was the center of the universe.  The church held fast to the teachings of
Ptolemy but, quietly, used Copernicus' theories because they produced a more
accurate measure of time.
<p>
In 1609 Galileo, using a telescope,  loudly proclaimed that Copernicus was
right and the proof was there for all to see.  The church accused him of
"vehement  suspicion of heresy",  locked him up, and banned his books.  It took
about four hundred years for the church to forgive him.
<p>
The question arises as to just why the church should care if an old theory is
proven incorrect?  At the time the church backed the world view of Aristotle, a
Greek philosopher of great wisdom, who lived in about 350 BC and had,
undoubtedly, never heard of the Catholic church let alone being a believer! 
<p>
In the eighteen hundreds Darwin proposed a theory of evolution that stated that
all forms of life evolved from lower forms over eons of time.  Churches of
every variety are still fighting this one.  The theory of evolution is no
longer a theory.  It is a fact that is observable in both the fossil record and
the genetic record both of creatures now extinct and in living people today.
One day the churches will have to give up the idea that they are the only
purveyors of truth and realize that the truths of two thousand years ago are
not quite good enough for today.
<p>
<h3>THE USES OF RELIGION</h3><p>
<p>
Humanity has a strong need for, and driving curiosity about, explanations of
where we came from, where we are going, and what the world around us is really
about.  The world as discovered by science is far more wonderful, amazing, and
incredible than the wildest of religious philosopher could ever have imagined.
As incredible as it is, it's provable and observable.
<p>
The real conflict is between the forces of belief and the forces of knowledge.
There should be no conflict here.  Both belief and knowledge are useful for
humanity but the territory of both is different. 
<p>
The field of belief belongs to religion and philosophy and is useful by the
human brain.  When a person believes in something strongly enough, no matter
how impossible it seems, very often one can find a way of making it happen.
Many, if not most, of humanities great forward strides came because someone
first believed in it.  Religion can give meaning, purpose and direction to
life.  It is not the only thing that can do so.  Members of Technocracy Inc.
most certainly know something about a life of meaning and purpose.
<p>
Religion has ceded much of the territory it should rightfully occupy to others
by, in effect, shouting at the sun not to rise in the morning.  In trying to
hold back new knowledge, religious institutions often generate great hatred and
fear trying to defend their territory. But if one goes back to the great
thinkers who founded these religions, it seems unlikely that they would support
such behavior.  Things that are subject to factual verification are not proper
subjects for religion.  Study of humanity's past indicates that technological
advance was followed by advances in human mental development.  Today one must
admit that it is badly needed.  Much of this need is being approached by what
is referred to as the self help movement.
<p>
The work done by people in this area is nearly exclusively empirical (whatever
works). There are many authors and books in this area.  The book stores are
full of them.  They discuss anything that people might want to change in their
lives.  They all have one major goal - to improve the performance of one's self
so as to gain greater satisfaction with one's self, or in other words, greater
self actualization. Tony Robbins discusses personal power (control of one's
behavior patterns).  Edward De Bono discusses how to improve your capability to
think clearly and creatively. Also, see Peak Learning by Ronald Gross.  From
this it is clear that improving human performance and more fully utilizing the
capacities of the human brain has become a priority for many.
<p>
<h3>ORIGINS</h3>
<p>
The human race has not been on the Earth for a very long time:<p>

  <tr><td>All of Recorded History:</td><td>7,000 years</td><h6></h6></tr>
</table>
The human race has gone through several major alterations to get where we are
today.  Genetics has always been the engine of change.  Genes are the blueprint
controlling the construction of anything living.  The blueprint can be altered
by mutation. Mutations are caused by radiation (usually a function of
elevation), higher than normal temperatures,  and chemical changes in the
environment. The immediate environment decides whether the new mutation is of
any value or not.  Usually they are not.  If the plant or animal survives and
prospers it leaves more offspring or perhaps is able to increase the territory
it occupies.
<p>
The human brain has a right and left hemisphere. The left brain controls
language, logical thinking, sequential events and so forth. The right controls
what are generally regarded as creative talents, art, music and so forth.  The
division between the two is not rigid. Each side is capable of doing things
that the other usually does but they are best at what they are specialized to
do.
<p>
The story of early humans is still far from unraveled but one of the early
sub-species of modern humans is referred to as Cro-Magnon.  They had larger
brains than modern humans! This being the case, why did they disappear?  They
left behind beautiful works of art on the cave walls in southern France.  The
art work was so sophisticated that many art critics refused to believe that it
was done by prehistoric humans. Is it possible that these people were so right
brained that they had difficulty developing and using language?
<p>
Learning a language is one of the most important functions of the human brain.
It appears that if a person does not learn a language of some kind by a certain
age they become something less than fully human.  Language, both written and
spoken, has created a whole new kind of evolution - cultural.  Humanity can
accumulate knowledge and pass it on to the next generation. While some other
species have some ability to learn (most mammals learn from their parents),
nowhere does it exist in anything like the extent in human beings.  Human
beings regularly learn powerful methods of manipulating symbols from people who
lived long ago.
<p>
At every stage of human development the species became better adapted to live
in a wider variety of conditions and climates by making intelligent use of the
materials in his environment.  With the development of modern humans the race
spread to every habitable corner of the globe.  In most areas man became a
hunter of large herbivores, quite probably driving many of them
extinct (<cite>Self Made Man</cite> by Kingdon). Mans' lack of concern
for his environment is not a new
thing.  But at that time he could just move somewhere else, away from the
problems he created.  Or he could change his taste and choice of food.  This
approach is proving not possible with the world full of people and food
everywhere in danger.
<p>
The development of agriculture, most likely by women, was a response to
population pressures or changing climatic conditions that could no longer be
ignored.  This occurred probably about 10,000 years ago. This most certainly
rates as one of humanities great breakthroughs.  Humanity no longer had to
scrounge for food since they could grow not only what they needed but what they
wanted.  If they had a surplus it could be stored, or traded for other goods.
It forced them to build better housing, leading eventually to cities.
<p>
Some seven thousand years ago humans invented what is sometimes called Urban
civilization (Man Makes Himself by V. Gordon Childe).  During a short period of
only about five hundred years virtually all the trappings of our modern
civilization were invented.  Nearly all the forms of social organization we are
familiar with today were invented.  Knowledge of ceramics, metals, mathematics,
written language was developed or consolidated.
<p>
<h3>THE VALUE OF MONEY</h3>
<p>
This development increased humanities share of the resources still further and
resulted in the development of an organized priesthood, military, and social
administration.  These forces put a stop to the innovation that was occurring.
Change threatens the social order and the established social structures.  This
is at the heart of the dilemma that we face today. The real  problem for the
social structure is that one of the things that has been institutionalized is
change and innovation!
<p>
It was at this time that money was invented.  This was a useful tool. Money is
a symbol that stands for wealth. Rather than having to deal with the actual
wealth (pigs, chicken, gem stones, wheat) they could carry one item that stood
for wealth in general.  This was a very big step.  Wealth became portable and
easily convertible into any kind of commodity.
<p>
Then the symbol, the tool, became a commodity itself. This happened the first
time someone allowed another person to use his wealth for some other purpose
and charged him money for the amount of time it was used - interest.  Then the
acquisition of money became an end in itself.  Money became the motivation for
human behavior.  When money is the motivation for doing something, a persons
behavior frequently becomes incomprehensibly dangerous because they are
responding only to a symbol and not physical information.  Why else would a
government pay farmers not to grow food when people are starving?  How many
unnecessary, wasteful, destructive projects have been constructed to provide
jobs?  Why do food producers load the food we eat with fat and salt when the
negative health impacts on the population is well known?  Could it be to make
more money?
<p>
<h3>POPULATION GROWTH</h3>
<p>
Each change in social state brings an increase in population density.  All
these population increases were preceded by technological innovations.  The
invention of agriculture accompanied a large increase which also required a new
social structure.  The inventions leading to urban civilization resulted in
another large increase followed by an entirely new social structure.  The
technological developments of the last two or three hundred years have been
nothing short of amazing and the pace of change continues to increase.  Not
only has the population increased dramatically but so has the standard of
living.  It most certainly follows that we will not escape an equally massive
social change.  This will be one of the greatest challenges for survival the
human race has ever faced.
<p>
<img src="popgrowth.gif" alt="[graph showing population growth over
the last million years]" WIDTH=476 HEIGHT=343>
<p>
When the Europeans came to North America they discovered a land that they
regarded as essentially uninhabited.  This is an apparently typical response
from people living at a higher level of social organization when moving into a
territory inhabited by people at a lower level. People living at a higher level
of social organization are, due to their mastery of the required technologies,
able to divert a higher fraction of the available energy from the environment
to their own uses.  At every point that humanity has achieved a new level of
technology the population density has increased and a new level of social
organization was required.  Our current social organization has been with us
for some seven thousand years.
<p>
The coming social evolution will be a major test of the ability of the human
race to survive.  That test is now coming to a head on the North American
Continent and the prospects do not appear promising.  The forces arrayed
against any kind of social change (except a reversion to unworkable fascism)
own and control all the mass media of communications, the economic structure,
and the government.
<p>
<h3>ORWELLIAN DEMOCRACY</h3>
<p>
In 1949 George Orwell wrote a novel titled "1984" . It was a chilling novel
about a future world order completely without hope.  The Ministry of Truth was
engaged in rewriting history as it happened so that the truth never reached the
populace.  Cameras watched everyone and anyone who showed any behavior the
system did not approve of was eliminated.  Essentially this is what we have
today, an Orwellian Democracy.
<p>
The, so called, democratic governments have been relegated to little more than
a hollow farce.  A small wealthy oligarchy can simply buy off the government
and most people have no real idea of what is really happening and most don't
care as long as they are not getting stepped on.  The fact that the government
is being bought off occurs in so subtle a manner that even those who are part
of it don't realize that it is happening.
<p>
People vote for a candidate because he sounds sincere and quite possibly he
really is.  He goes to congress and proposes very idealistic legislation.
Everyone is impressed.  Shortly thereafter he is visited by a numbers of people
(many high paid lawyers, maybe even old friends) who have some very persuasive
arguments as to why his wonderful legislation should be altered - just a little
bit.  Then others in congress come to him and say that if he really wants his
bill passed he will have to change it a little more. As the process proceeds
the bill looks less and less like anything of real value to the people it was
intended for.  But finally the bill passes. He tells his constituents - well,
at least it's a start.
<p>
Now it is the turn of the governmental apparatus to interpret what the bill
really means and how it will be enforced.  Now his wonderful legislation has
become a weapon against the very people it was initially supposed to help.
Some people wonder why participation in voting has declined so much. Many
people have learned how much it really matters.  Others vote because they are
afraid the bad guys will take over.  Technocracy Inc. has some bad news for
those of you who are afraid of the bad guys.  They are in charge.
<p>
Of course one can back this up a little further and take a look at that great
sounding, sincere, honest person running for office.  Occasionally a real
maverick ( translate someone who really is interested in the welfare of his
constituents) does get elected.  The system will glowingly point to these rare
commodities as wonderful examples of how free our system is.  The survival
chances of anyone who is sincerely not interested primarily in his own
interests either getting or staying in office without the "big money" very long
are slim indeed.
<p>
<h3>THE MASS MEDIA OF DISINFORMATION</h3>
<p>
The mass media of communications are owned and controlled by the wealthy
oligarchy.  They do not directly control  what goes out over the air, they
don't have to.  They hire the people who control the people who go out on the
air.  Anyone who does not have the proper point of view will never be hired.
The mass media of communication in the United States is more tightly controlled
than the censors of the old USSR could have ever dreamed (see Manufacturing
Consent by Noam Chomsky or any of his many excellent books).  The media seldom
tell lies, although they will if they feel it is necessary, they just don't
report what they don't want people to hear.
<p>
A major clue that the media is trying to cover up something occurs when the
media begins to slander someone or something.  Investigative writers who have
become adept at digging out the really rotten secrets our government is trying
to hide from its people are today referred to as "conspiracy theorists".
Recently an investigation was concluded, many years after the fact, on the Iran
- Contra cover-up conducted during the Reagan Administration. The conclusion
reached was that the President should have been impeached.  The media responded
to this by launching a personal attack on those who did the investigation.  The
actual facts were not discussed very much.
<p>
Public relations firms that mostly work out of Washington DC offer to
manufacture public opinion for sale to the highest bidder (see Flack Attack in
the Utne Reader Jan.-Feb. 94).  How many letters are sent to a congressman on
any side of any issue depends on how much money one is willing to spend.
<p>
<h3>DISINTEGRATION</h3>
<p>
It is in this whirlpool of decay, disintegration, and a near total lack of any
understanding of the forces impinging on their destiny that the people of North
America face one of the greatest, if not the greatest, challenge ever presented
to humanity.  The continuing and accelerating application of energy and
technology to the means of production continues the elimination of jobs in the
economy. As technology forces the collapse of the price system few have the
remotest idea not only of what is happening, or why, but where to go for
information.
<p>
Humanity is now involved in a basic high school biology experiment.  Conditions
inside a small glass dish are made ideal for bacteria growth, plenty of food,
ideal temperature and humidity.  A small group of bacteria are introduced into
the dish.  The bacteria will multiply exponentially until the mass reaches the
edge of the dish, consume all the food, and drowned in their own waste.  With
the price system social mode of control we now have that is where humanity is
headed.  Environmental scientists meeting in Wenatchee, Washington February 10,
1994 stated "some 34 percent of all fish species, 75 percent of the mussels and
65 percent of all crayfish species have become rare or extinct due to habitat
degradation and other human causes. .... Commercial fish harvest are down by
more than 80 percent from those of a few years ago."  Humanity will reach a
balance with the environment one way or the other.  Our social system is
driving us to extinction in the direction it is currently taking us.
<p>
Technocracy Inc. alone has an analysis of the conditions destroying the price
system and where that will take us.  The people of North America have a choice
between total social breakdown and moving forward in what has to be described
as the greatest step in human social evolution.  The futility of any action
that involves straightening out the current system should be obvious. Those
that have the power favor the status quo even if it means a near guarantee that
the human race will not survive.
<p>
The situation is certainly desperate but not entirely hopeless.  People have
banded together to form organizations to fight for causes they believe in.
These organizations have learned to fight with the same tools as the oligarchy
and even to invent a few of their own.  The vision of such organizations is
frequently narrow but that may contribute to some extent to their success.
People would never have formed such organizations if they did not realize that
governmental processes are hopelessly subverted.  Nonetheless, virtually all of
these organizations continue to work within the system and their basic premise
is that we just need to be vigilant and that the system needs perfecting.  This
is a forlorn cause.
<p>
As humanity moves into the next century, universal education, a very recent
innovation, becomes a given.  New methods of improving and more fully utilizing
our mental potential are being developed and exploited.  Humanity is on the
verge of being able to turn genes on and off.  The capability of changing the
genetic structure of the next generation is nearly within our grasp.  The
ability to change the genetic structure of people now living appears also to be
close at had.  Not only does humanity have control of cultural evolution but
also of genetic.
<p>
The collapse of the price system, invented some seven thousand years ago, to
deal with conditions far different from today, is inevitable. It is also
desirable. Because unless humanity is permitted to supersede the twisted view
that a price system forces on people, the chances of surviving the oncoming
technology would also be slim.  What sort of society would this have to be?
<p>
<h3>A NEW DESIGN</h3>
<p>
An old Chinese proverb states that government that governs best governs least.
That is just what is being proposed by Technocracy Inc.  The primary function
of government in a price system is to protect property rights.  Property rights
are nothing more than a code of behavior that is dependent on a price system
for existence.  Without a price system property rights disappear.  The only
thing this really leaves for a social organization is to operate all the
physical equipment we depend on for our lives.  Some behavioral codes will
still be needed.  Traffic lights will still be needed.  One could not move into
anothers' home uninvited.
<p>
We need structure, some sort of organization, to operate industries and provide
for lines of communication between suppliers and supplied.  Technocracy Inc.
proposed energy as the unit of measurement for social operations because it is
the most fundamental measure of anything physical.  It provides a feedback
mechanism to operate the social order.  That is say that when an item is
purchased in a store the amount of energy required for its manufacture and
transportation is recorded and reported to the warehouse it came from.  The
warehouse reports to the factory and a new item is produced. Recording the
energy used also gives accurate information for analyzing the social structure
to make it more efficient.
<p>
It is also necessary to devise a structure for dividing up the wealth of the
area.  A certain amount of the wealth must be re-invested to maintain the
physical plant and equipment of the area roads, hospital, schools, factories,
recreational facilities and so forth. The remainder is divided up between the
inhabitants. When one divides up the wealth of the area among the inhabitants
one must distribute the same amount of wealth, or at least consuming
privileges, to each. To do otherwise is to re-establish a price system.  Once
we have moved beyond a price system going back to one would involve
disenfanchisement of a large percentage of the population. Distinguishing
between individuals will have to be on the basis of what you are and what you
can do.
<p>
If problems of a continental nature surface, they would probably revolve around
prioritizing how the wealth of the area is to be used.  The environmental
impact statement might very well serve as a good model for this.  Setting up an
interactive electronic forum for discussion of national priorities is now
within our technological ability.  Such an operation would be a true democracy
not the fake republican governmental structure that exists today. When one does
all these things one arrives at the governmental structure outlined by
Technocracy Inc. 
<p>
Technocracy Inc. invites the citizens of North America to become involved in
one of humanities great forward movements to a new level of social existence.
This movement, Technocracy Inc., would permit humanity to move forward into a
future with hope of realistically achieving any goals we can envision.
