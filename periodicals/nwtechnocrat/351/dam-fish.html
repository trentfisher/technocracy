There are photographs from the early nineteen hundreds of salmon caught in the
Columbia River weighing over sixty pounds an nearly as long as a man is tall.
They are gone.  Arguments about the few survivors abound.  Some writers are
referring to the million dollar fish due to the amount of money being spent
with so little effect.  The Bonneville Power Administration, the Federal power
marketing agency for the Pacific Northwest, has spent more money on fish
restoration projects than any other governmental agency.
<p>
Many prefer to blame the many dams on the river as they are the most visible
blockades to fish passage.  It is obvious that some thought was given to fish
passage at the time the dams were constructed as fish ladders were provided.  A
little closer inspection reveals that only a little thought was given.  The
fish ladders provide passage upstream but little thought was given to
downstream passage.  The design of the fish ladders, in retrospect, appears to
have been initially designed more as a tourist attraction than to really help
the fish.  There were those who warned about this problem at the time but
little was done until the fish were on the brink of extinction.
<p>
When governmental agencies finally began to respond to the problem it was
discovered how little was known about the fish.  Also, when one does do
something to restore, it takes about five years before one knows what effect
one has had.  Salmon are born in quiet streams that feed the rivers.  They
travel down the river to the ocean and it will be several years before they
return to spawn and die.  A large number of theories appeared as to what was
the best course to follow but little hard data existed.  Some wanted to tear
down the dams which were blamed for the decimation of fish stocks.
<p>
As was pointed out, rivers that had no dams at all still had devastated fish
populations as well as those that had dams.  Typically, political solutions,
consist mostly of unsubstantiated opinions.  The real answers are far more
complex.  Loggers and farmers had destroyed the spawning beds.  Loggers
destroyed the stream side vegetation, and drove equipment through the streams.
Farmers permitted cattle herds access to the streams directly, and fertilizer
and pesticides run off into the streams.  The large reservoirs behind dams
served as an excellent environment for the growth of predators picking off the
salmon as they came down the river.  Some rivers had so much water withdrawn
from them for agriculture that they occasionally ran dry.
<p>
The tail race of dams, if not controlled, include enough dissolved nitrogen
that the fish can be killed by a disease similar to the bends suffered by
divers who dive too deep.  If reservoirs are allowed to rise and fall by too
large an amount, stream side vegetation does not develop so that it is possible
for the fish to starve to death on their way to the ocean.  Fish that go
through the turbines do not fair well.  A percentage of fish are killed by
passage at each dam.
<p>
Fish that do survive the return trip can get lost in irrigation canals so these
require fish screens.  If the design is improper or they are not properly
maintained they serve to kill fish as well as save them.
<p>
To avoid the hazards of the down stream trip the salmon are rounded up and
barged past the dams.  Some farmers, once they understood the problem, acted to
try to rectify the situation.  Some loggers likewise tried to cure some of the
damage that had been done.  Others simply regarded the whole problem as a
threat to their bottom line, financing political campaigns to silence those
complaining about the destruction of another species.
<p>
Hatcheries had been designed mostly to provide fish for sport and commercial
fishermen.  It was discovered that the hatchery fish were displacing the native
fish by the shear numbers produced.  But the hatchery fish were not anywhere
near as well adapted to their environment as the native fish and the lack of
genetic diversity made them vulnerable to disease.  Not only did new hatcheries
have to be designed and built but a whole new method of supplementing the
native runs had to be constructed.
<p>
The fish problem in the Pacific Northwest illustrates the price system approach
to physical problems.  The physical environment is regarded as a consumable
resource rather than seeing human beings as a part of a continuous fabric of
life on Earth.  Little attention was paid to fish when the dams were built
because people wanted power, flood control, and irrigation.  There was money in
that the fish were in the river at the time and available to all who wished to
fish for them.  The price of straightening out the problem was passed to the
next generation.
<p>
Had the problem been dealt with at the time, the cost in just about all terms
would have been far less.  It is money that determines decisions in a price
system.  Technological problems created by the installation of a new technology
usually are the result of failing to consider consequences due to the fact that
there is no money involved or the consequence has no political constituency.
It is also worth mentioning that by delaying a solution much more money can be
made trying to straighten it out later.
<p>
The destruction of most of the worlds major fisheries continues unabated.
Price system theory says that, as one resource becomes exhausted, others will
rise to take their place.  This may be true but as the resource becomes more
scarce the price rises, making it a more lucrative target.  Now policing
becomes necessary.  Watching this scenario unfold again and again only points
to the dangerous stupidity of price system operation.
<p>
The operation of price system warps the view of any problem.  The physical
consequences of any activity is considered only in the light of monetary gain.
In a price system the order of consideration is, first, financial, second,
political, last and definitely least, physical.  The installation of a
Technocracy would not simply reverse this order, it would eliminate the first
two.  Human survival would be moved to the top of the list.  The implications
of technological installations could be examined without the interferences
inherent in price system operation.  Technology could be optimized for human
benefit rather than devastating the planet for a paper symbol.
