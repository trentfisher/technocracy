magazine as this was converted directly from the author's word

In the deep dark days of the sixties computer memory was a scarce, rare
commodity.  Young programmers discovered another clever trick for using a
little less memory.  Each year consists of four numbers.  Only the last one
changes every year.  The one next to it changes once every ten years.  The next
one only changes every one hundred years and the next one only changes once
every thousand years.  The year 2000 seemed very far away.  This means that one
can save a lot of memory if only the last two digits are used.  When it is
necessary to print it out a nineteen is automatically tacked on for the first
two digits.  This became such a standard method of programming that it was an
automatic part of any program written.  Now the year 2000 is fast approaching.
On January one 2000, these computers will think that it is 1900.
<p>
No one is quite sure what will happen.  It will probably depend on each
individual case.  In some cases the computer will not work at all.  In other
cases it will give wrong answers or simply function erratically.  Others may
simply run slower.  Probably one of the first organizations to stumble over the
problem was the Social Security Administration of the U.S. government.  They
project earnings and payments on retirement accounts into the future.  An
article in the September issue of "Mechanical Engineering" estimates a world
wide cost of 600 billion dollars to fix the problem.  Some computers may just
be scrapped rather than try to find all the bugs.
<p>
The NASA, the U.S. space agency, has found that computers as new as 166 Mhz
pentium computers are not year 2000 compliant.  NASA has determined that 72
percent of their computers are not year 2000 compliant as reported in Federal
Computer Week.  The Mechanical Engineering article quoted professor Michael
Lutz saying that anything that compares times will be affected.  In one
reported year 2000 test by Hawaiian Electric the entire system shut down.  
<p>
Probably one of the most sinister impacts exists in what is called embedded
systems.  These are systems that have micro chips as an integral part of the
system.  The programming in such systems is essentially hard wired into the
chip and not easily accessible.  Federal Computer Week states that the Veterans
Administration of the U.S. government is concerned about sophisticated medical
equipment.  All modern automobiles use many computer chips embedded in the
engine system.
<p>
Computer software companies are busily writing programs designed to detect or
fix the problem but no one will know how well they work until January 1, 2000.
As the article in Mechanical Engineering stated, ``the end is near.''
