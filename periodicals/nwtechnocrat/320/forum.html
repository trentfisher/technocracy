The Letter to Ann Landers from a 23-year-old college graduate 
which appeared in the Thursday edition of the Times-Gazette was 
the most scathing indictment of our politico-economic system that 
has appeared anywhere.
<p>
The statement, "We just don't know where to start," reveals the 
frustration and despair that is felt by the youth of today.  Our 
present social system does not give youth a sense of direction 
that the exuberance and enthusiasm of youth demands.  The young 
man cited numerous world-wide problems that are growing and he 
knows that his generation will have these problems dumped in their 
lap.  That is the political way -- postpone any solutions until it 
becomes somebody else's problem.  Unfortunately, we are fast 
approaching the time when postponements will not do any more.
<p>
His letter should be read by every officeholder in the country -- 
starting with the president on down to the lowliest "dogcatcher."
<p>
One statement he makes, "There are enough weapons to blow up the 
world we live in 40 times!" should be underlined in red! Still we 
build more and more armaments and help arm other countries who are 
in conflict with their neighbors.
<p>
What kind of world is this for our youth to look forward to?  If 
they are not drafted to fight in the Army, then their livelihood 
is curtailed by the need to pay for all this useless armament.
<p>
Not only that, but the destruction and waste of irreplaceable 
resources that are thrown away on the arms buildup will 
impoverish their children if they live long enough to have any.
<p>
There are other signs and symptoms of youth's frustration and 
their lack of direction and that is the growing unrest in the 
large cities: gangs; gang warfare; and racial unrest.  All 
elements of a very serious explosion are just waiting to happen.
<p>
Unless a complete restructuring of our social system, as outlined 
in Technocracy Inc., is forthcoming soon, our youth will be 
sacrificed needlessly on the altar of greed and complacency of an 
obsolete social system.
