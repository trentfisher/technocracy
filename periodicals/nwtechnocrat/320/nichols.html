<p>
The stock market crash of 1929 was the spectacular beginning, not 
only of the most devastating depression in the nation's history, 
but it was also a very visible sign of breakdown of that ancient 
system of trade and commerce based on commodity valuation called a 
Price System.  Business, the banks, the whole financial structure, 
were all on their knees.  It was then decided that it would be 
necessary for the federal government to come to the rescue with 
massive injections of federal debt.
<p>
Since then there has been a steady acceleration of the federal 
debt. During the past 56 years there has been only 5 years when 
the debt hasn't increased, and none of those 5 years were during 
the past 30 years.  But all this increasing debt has only 
accomplished a postponement of the day when the Price System can 
no longer operate.  During those 56 years, the political, business 
and financial leaders could have instituted an educational program 
to prepare the citizens of this Continent for the vast changes 
which would be required when this Price System is replaced -- by a 
social design of functional control.  Unfortunately, and for their 
own reasons, those Price System leaders chose to withhold this 
information and, as a result, North Americans have so little 
knowledge concerning these developments that the collapse of the 
Price System may come as a complete surprise to many and be far 
more devastating than the depression of the 1930s.
<p>
Whatever action people may take concerning this fraud remains to 
be seen, but when one considers the dissatisfaction demonstrated 
with such minor affairs as Watergate and the Iran-Contra business, 
one must assume that much more than mere displeasure will 
inevitably occur.  However, that is for the future to determine; 
at present the important concern is whether or not there will be a 
future.
<p>
What is a country to do when it can't stop the growth of debt?  In 
all the history of the United States until 1915, a total of 139 
years, the federal debt had grown to $1.2 billion.  Since 1915 it 
grew at an ever faster pace.  In 1940 it was $42.9 billion, in 
1960 it was $286 billion, and by 1980 it had increased to $908 
billion.  From 1980 to 1990, in only 10 years, this debt has more 
than tripled to $3 TRILLION.  This debt is 2,500 times what it was 
in 1915.
<p>
The federal debt, great as it is, is not the total debt which the 
overburdened American taxpayers are expected to pay.  Add all the 
debts of the states, the counties, the municipal, the corporate 
and the consumer debt.  Add all these debts to the federal debt, 
and the grand total is now <cite>$11 TRILLION</cite>.  Explain all this debt in 
any way that may seem reasonable, but it is what has been 
necessary to keep this Price System alive, and the fact is that 
the American people can never pay it.
<p>
A refusal to face up to this problem only postpones the day of 
reckoning while the problem continues to grow.  Concealing the 
increase of the federal deficit behind the social security and 
other trust funds or placing billions "off budget" is only a 
temporary expediency.  The total debt is still increasing at more 
than $1 trillion per year and the rate of growth is increasing.  
There is no way that the U.S. can avoid a collapse of the debt 
structure, period.
<p>
Continental tinkering with the Price System may preserve people's 
faith in money for a time, but there is no way of predicting the 
tolerance of people.  The list of Price system failures is long 
and growing rapidly, but there is no way to tell when a stalemate 
occurs.
<p>
Consider the fact that as the debt continues to increase, the 
value of the dollar declines.  While the debt has gone up 2,500 
times since 1915, the value of the 1940 dollar has declined to 11 
cents in 1989.  If we are expecting to pay the debt with worthless 
dollars, disillusion will be our reward.  It will be interesting 
to see how we try to operate our society with a declining 
confidence in the dollar.
<p>
These trends are and have been occurring, and anyone who is 
interested enough to visit any public library should be able to 
verify them in the Statistical Abstract of the U.S.
<p>
If the problem were simple it would have been solved long ago.  If 
it could be explained in a few simple words, everyone would have 
those answers.  And, if the answers could fit with the ideas of 
the past, the problem could have been solved without the need for 
new concepts.
<p>
The difference between our society today and that of the past is 
due chiefly to the application of the scientific method to the 
problems of production.  Throughout the 7,000 years of 
inaccurately recorded human history, the political method has 
never made a major contribution to man's ability to produce.  
Without that ability, the means whereby humans lived changed very 
little and very slowly.  When the Declaration of Independence was 
signed by the founding fathers, the horse was still the greatest 
provider of energy outside the human body.  Ninety-eight percent 
of the energy available for the production process was supplied by 
the muscles of humans, and the living standard was limited to that 
ability.  Since then, and chiefly during the 20th century, this 
condition has changed, until now, in 1990, less than two percent 
is supplied by humans.  Over ninety-eight percent is now provided 
by burning coal, oil or gas, by falling water, etc.  The knowledge 
required for this change was provided by the scientific method.
<p>
The political and business operators that have been dominant for 
centuries in the control of human affairs and in the distribution 
of goods were quick to seize control of the results of scientific 
knowledge for their own benefit.  More goods could be produced 
with fewer man-hours of human labor to sell to more people for 
greater profits than ever before.
<p>
This was great!  But -- the decreasing need for human labor per-
unit-of-production and the resulting decline in purchasing power 
per-unit-produced began to catch up with the ability to buy the 
amount produced around the early '20s.  Consumer debt was devised 
to allow the "customers" to buy more than they could pay for.  As 
long as we could sell all we could produce at a profit, we could 
continue to increase production and maintain employment with ever 
more efficient equipment.  When the quantity of production became 
too great to maintain prices, we bought up farm products (on 
credit, of course) and destroyed them; we paid farmers to produce 
less, and business soon learned about planned obsolescence.
<p>
A great time was had by all, except for those who couldn't find 
good paying jobs, and it was all done by increasing the debt.  We 
borrowed the money from those who made the most profits from the 
increasing debt structure, and they now make profits from the 
interest on the debt which we incurred to increase their profits 
in the first place.  Simple?
<p>
How are we to operate our society with a dollar which has no 
value?  Our society is controlled by people who have vast 
quantities of dollars (a form of debt).  They own the mortgages on 
our homes, on our cars, and often the shirts on our backs.  They 
control the distribution networks, the news networks, the 
department stores, the banks, insurance companies -- and they 
control the politicians.  They control the flow of money which we 
use to buy groceries, to pay our taxes and to pay our debts.  When 
the owners of all this debt can only be paid with worthless 
dollars, what can they then do with a control mechanism which is 
no longer effective?
<p>
The white man's society on this Continent has never known a social 
control technique which didn't include money.  The dollar has 
become man's god, and that god is being destroyed by the massive 
growth of technology.  The North American Continent now has the 
greatest technological mechanism on earth.  This technology can 
produce so much that it can supply the needs of every citizen on 
the Continent, and it is destroying the value of money.  The 
politicians don't know what to do about it, the bankers don't know 
and don't want to know.  The American people have never heard of 
such a thing and wouldn't believe it if they had.  And this, the 
biggest news story since 1492, doesn't even make the evening news 
on TV.
<p>
It is in the best interest of every North American citizen, 
including those who own the debt, that plans be made to overcome 
the chaotic conditions likely to occur when we must default on the 
debt and money becomes worthless.  An alternate method of social 
operation must be available without delay.  It is unfair and it is 
unpatriotic to withhold information concerning this subject.
<p>
This is what has been happening in the U.S. and Canada for more 
than a half century.  The only solution is the installation of an 
entirely new economic system which is designed to operate without 
either money or debt.  Technocracy has the design, all we need is 
the intelligence to use it.
