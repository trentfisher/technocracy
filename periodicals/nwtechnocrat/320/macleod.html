Technocracy had its beginning just after the conclusion of the 
First World War with a group of people who helped direct the war 
industries of World War I.  Some fifteen men and one woman, in the 
winter of 1918-19 in New York city, were led by Howard Scott, a 
young engineering scientist in his 20's, into organizing what 
became known as the Technical Alliance.  Those engineers, 
mathematicians, architects, foresters, statisticians, educators, 
physicists, chemists, physicians and others, had been working  in 
their professional capacities directly or indirectly, for the 
federal government during World War I.  To name a few: Dr. Charles 
P. Steinmetz, the wizard of the General Electric company; Dr. 
Richard Tolman, physicist, and during World War II, chairman of 
the National Research Board.  Leland Olds, who President Roosevelt 
made chairman of the Federal Power Commission during the 1930s and 
1940s.  There was the president of the American Institute of 
Architects, the Chief of the Bureau of Chemistry of the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture, Dr. Alice Barrows Fernandes, who became 
Chief of the Division of Design of school buildings for the United 
States for the office of Education, and Professor Thorstein 
Veblen, an economist.  Those people, and others who worked with 
them, were not a group of wishful thinking philosophers, but, 
instead, were a nucleus of trained professionals.  Those trained 
professionals had recognized what could be accomplished in 
coordinating the nation's resources for war, and under Howard 
Scott's leadership they set out to investigate the possibility and 
feasibility of coordinating the nation's resources in peace time.  
They wanted to understand what was needed in order to eliminate 
waste, increase technical efficiency, mechanize industry to reduce 
man-hours and multiply production so that a higher standard of 
living could be provided for everyone, not just the favored few.  
That was how the idea of Technocracy got its start.
<p>
From time immemorial, all the things that had to be done were 
accomplished by human muscle power plus a few domesticated 
animals. Meanwhile, a few innovative minds were thinking that 
there must be a better way, an easier way, to accomplish work.  
And, over a long period of time, those inventive minds produced 
the where-with-all that allowed man to elevate himself above the 
other animal species of the world.
<p>
Now, among the ecological associations of the world, man is the 
most dominant animal species, except in a few areas where he has not 
penetrated in large numbers.  Although man has been a component 
part of the balance of nature, it was not until quite recently in 
his history that he became a disturbing influence to that balance.  
Because of his greater innate intelligence and his inventiveness, 
as well as his social organization, man was able to tilt the 
dynamic balance more and more in his favor.
<p>
The invention of weapons and tools, the use of fire, the 
development of language as a means of communication and social 
memory gave man a decided advantage in the struggle for survival 
over other animals of comparable or even larger size.  The 
domestication of plants and animals and other technological 
developments accelerated this advantage through the centuries 
until, now, man has become almost everywhere the most dominant 
species in the environment, if not in numbers at least in the 
effect which he has produced.  During ninety-eight percent of 
man's seven thousand years of civilized existence on the earth, 
this technological process was so slow that the disturbance of the 
ecological balance was only of a minor magnitude and only local in 
its effect.  But the last two percent of that time, the last 140 
years, tells a far different story.
<p>
During this time man has become a plague upon the earth.  He has 
exterminated and exhausted many species which roamed the earth, 
flew the sky or swam the waters by the hundreds of millions.  He 
has ploughed up the sod and slashed away at the plant growth until 
many areas which were once verdant with forests and grasses are 
now desolate.  The ecological environment in which man as a 
species can flourish is now shrinking because of his own careless 
behaviour.  Man has also let his population increase to the point 
where it has become self-destructive.  He must not only combat the 
other elements of the environment in order to survive, he must 
battle within his own species to determine which individuals and 
which groups are to survive.
<p>
No matter how one tries to rationalize the value of human life, one 
cannot escape the conclusion there are just too many human beings 
on the earth.  As a result of this over-burden of population, the 
destruction of forests and other organic life which is consumed in 
the process of human living is, in many instances, greater than 
the replacement of the particular species involved.  For example, 
over-grazing of the rangeland in the western United States has so 
reduced the edible plants and so eroded the soil that the 
rangeland will not support more than a fraction of the livestock 
it did several decades ago, and the people of North America are 
cutting down the forests faster than they are being replenished.  
Even certain species of life in the ocean are becoming exhausted, 
not only the great whales, but certain species of shell-fish and 
true-fishes used for food.
<p>
It is not only organic factors of the environment that are being 
disturbed by man's recent activities on the earth, but the 
disturbance extends to the inorganic elements as well.  Through 
millions of years, the earth has been saturated with water below a 
certain level.  This level is known as the water table.  Man has 
disturbed this ground water in a great many places.  He has instituted 
drainage to remove surplus water from the surface which has 
resulted in a lowering of the water table.  He has destroyed the 
plant cover in many areas, and this permits a more rapid run-off; 
hence less water seeps into the ground.  He has drilled wells and 
pumped water out of the ground at a faster rate than it has been 
replaced by natural means.  He has diverted many lakes and streams 
and underground flows into the water mains of large cities and 
increased the population of the cities beyond the capacities of 
the water to supply their needs.  Thus, in many areas where there 
was adequate water to supply a moderate population on a long-term 
basis, there is now a deficiency of water because of the 
uncontrolled increase of the population and the short-sighted 
exploitation of the water resources.
<p>
Another inorganic factor which man is misusing is the arable soil 
of the earth.  It is estimated that about a fourth of the original 
area having arable soil has been ruined, with a large part 
of the remainder damaged.  On the basis of suitable land area 
alone there are already six hundred million more people on earth 
than the soil can feed with a decent diet -- but the population is 
increasing at the rate of more than 98 million per year.
<p>
During his industrial growth, and motivated by the wasteful 
practices of business exploitation, man has become profligate in 
the use of many minerals.  A number of these most critical 
minerals are nearing the state of deficiency and some are rapidly 
approaching exhaustion. For example, the United States can no 
longer meet its own internal consumption in some strategic 
minerals and must import, in some cases, from sources that may not 
remain friendly.  What was once the most handsomely endowed land 
area anywhere on this planet, is rapidly approaching the status of 
being a have-not area.  We have exported our know-how; we have 
exported our technology, and the developing world is now 
installing the most up-to-date technological equipment that is 
turning out finished products far cheaper than our own internal 
obsolescent equipment can even approach.
<p>
It is of little moment, in the long run, whether the human species 
of this Continent can maintain its present industrial pace for 
another ten years or another hundred.  The important thing that we 
are attempting here is a long-range projection of man's ecological 
trend, especially as it pertains to the North American Continent.  
This much we can say for sure: man will not be able to live on the 
North American Continent for the next generation as he has lived 
for the past generation.  He has been far too prodigal with his 
heritage; this has left him in the position of being repudiated by 
his environment.  The people of North America cannot continue for 
even a few more years at their present magnitude of free 
enterprise operation.  The environment will not supply the raw 
materials for this type of human onslaught for long.  What the 
future of the people living on the Continent will become is 
something fearful to contemplate, yet the North American citizen, 
instead of acknowledging the facts and recognizing the trend, is 
blindly and blatantly going ahead to increase the very factors 
which are contributing most to the downfall of this vaunted 
civilization.  Man, under his present mode of operation, may not 
long be the climax species in the environment.  He is a 
transitional species for he is taking more from the environment 
than is being replaced.  He is scheduled therefore, in the course 
of events, to lose his dominant position in the environment, 
perhaps to be superceded by something else.  Whether that 
something else is insect or rodent or weed does not much matter 
once man succumbs.  The same factors that are pointing in a 
downward direction on the North American Continent also apply in a 
greater or lesser degree to other parts of the world.
<p>
A few students of human affairs recognize what is happening and 
make a fairly accurate analysis of the situation.  Their 
prescriptions are clear.  Their analyses of the prevailing trends 
and appraisals of the danger leave no doubt as to the probability 
of dire consequences, and their warnings are almost hysterical.  
But when it comes to giving a synthesis for survival most of their 
suggestions are puerile or fantastic.  They lack the realism and 
boldness of concept the analyses demand.
<p>
And it is a very sad commentary on the intelligence of the human 
species that it is not able to plan adequately for its own 
survival. Now that civilized man has become dominant in the 
organic world and has every advantage, it seems paradoxical that 
he should be headed pell-mell for oblivion.
<p>
The picture might indeed be bleak except for the thinking of one 
man.  One man had the intelligence, the strategical genius and 
the integrity to develop an idea for human survival that is in 
harmony with the facts and with the social needs of man.  Howard 
Scott worked out a strategy for a social operation that could be 
blueprinted into a social plan for the North American Continent.  
His idea, in time, became known as Technocracy.
<p>
Technocracy repudiates the assertion that man is incapable of a 
proper stewardship of this planet.  Technocracy maintains that it 
is possible for man to remain the dominant species on earth and at 
the same time enjoy a high standard of living for many centuries 
to come.  It is possible for him to be the climax species in a new 
ecological balance.  And it is possible for him to do this at a 
level of existence even far above that which we consider to be the 
average living standard of North Americans today.  Technocracy has 
the only blueprint for a high-energy social mechanism that will 
not soon run down.  To survive, man must adopt a new strategy for 
his social operations and change his mode of living to conform 
with that strategy.  He must return unto the ecological system as 
much as he takes from it.  If man can do that, he can survive and 
flourish for thousands of years more on earth.  If he does not, 
nature will take a ruthless course so far as the human species is 
concerned.
