Dear Editor:
<p>
Two articles in the Post Crescent, "U.S. can't afford the economic 
hardship of peace" (Nov. 25/89) and "Economic stability relies on 
sales" (Nov. 28/89) -- point to the flimsy understanding of the 
impact science and technology has on our lives and how we should 
operate our economy.  We are deathly afraid of peace and think if 
we buy, buy, buy, we can buy prosperity, but if spending slackens 
there will be a depression.  Where are our brains?  Can't we think 
of a better way to operate?  Money has become useless as a 
distributer of goods and services, and is our most serious social 
problem.
<p>
For the first time in history, with science and technology, we are 
able to produce, with fewer workers, more goods and services than 
there is money to buy the increased production -- enough for all 
North Americans.  This calls for a completely different method of 
operation, one that will work in harmony with the environment and 
the resource-technological capabilities of this Continent -- or 
our obsolete "free enterprise" system will eliminate us.  There is 
no freedom without economic security.
<p>
Technological production began before the Great Depression, in 
fact was mostly the cause of the Great Depression when over 50 
years ago huge quantities of food stuffs were destroyed as people 
didn't have the money to buy the increased production -- no jobs, 
no money, no food.  People went hungry, and it has continued ever 
since.  Milk was poured into ditches and fruits and vegetables 
were dumped in fields and crude oil poured over them to prevent 
people getting any for free.  Now, surpluses are stored in caves 
at great cost while the number of poor and homeless grows.  Does 
this make sense?
<p>
World War II bailed the U.S. out of the Depression, and prosperity 
continued in the Cold War with Russia serving as the necessary 
"enemy" to justify the spending of billions of dollars for 
armaments each year.  (No half-pint enemy would do.)  The bottom 
line of the military policy of the U.S. is profits, not its 
deterrent value.  Under the obsolete Price System we are trillions 
of dollars in debt which will never be paid.  How big is a 
trillion?  (One trillion seconds in time equals 32,000 years.)  
War is obsolete, solves nothing, just reduces population, maims 
people and destroys resources.
<p>
The free enterprise system is like an old jalopy that has outlived 
its usefulness.  We change drivers at election time, hopefully 
expecting the old jalopy to run again, but no matter how willing 
and dedicated the drivers may be, they can do no more than the old 
vehicle is capable of doing.  New drivers or a new vehicle?  
Technocracy is that new vehicle, modern, high-powered and 
extremely efficient, ready to advance civilization to a new 
height.
