If the Internal Revenue Service has its way, the American Price 
System will go on, even in the event of a nuclear attack.  And the 
less devastated areas will be hardest hit when the income tax man 
comes calling, according to columnist Jack Smith.
<p>
Quoting from an article in the San Jose, Calif. MERCURY NEWS, 
Smith points out that the boundless magnanimity of the I.R.S. has 
found expression in a new section of the Internal Revenue Manual, 
mandated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.  To quote the 
manual:  "In the event of a national emergency (especially a 
nuclear attack) the primary function of the service is to support 
the Secretary of the Treasury."  On the subject of those too hard 
hit to generate any revenue, there is an inspiring note on 
delinquent accounts.  It reads:  "On the premise that the 
collection of delinquent accounts would be most adversely 
affected, and in many cases would be impossible in a disaster 
area, the service will concentrate on the collection of current 
taxes."
<p>
Which says, in so many words, if you're one of the lucky ones who 
doesn't have their skin flayed from their bodies by the searing 
heat of a thermonuclear explosion, the I.R.S. is ready and willing 
to perform the service for you.
<p>
Which goes to demonstrate that, in a Price System operation, the two 
surest things are indeed death and taxes -- but not necessarily in 
that order.
