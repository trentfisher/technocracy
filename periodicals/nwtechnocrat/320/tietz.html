Language, like the sun, must light our way.  It is the intellect's 
method of communication, and if we are to develop a civilization 
worthy of the intelligence of humankind, it of necessity must be 
free of ambiguity.  It must be articulate, precise, probing, 
relativistic, all in factual accord with the impelling directions 
of nature's changes.
<p>
The millennia of evolution witnessed massive geological and 
climatological forces molding the environment.  It was a time 
demanding the utmost of the reasoning powers and survival 
instincts of all living species.  The primordial human mind had to 
have concentration and emphasis upon the basic necessities in the 
struggle for survival, and was bound to ignorance because of its 
limited experience -- its limited social memory.  Those habits and 
instincts have consequences that today threaten the extinction of 
life.
<p>
It must have been an era of vivid imaginings, dark superstitions 
and fears, many of which constitute the limitations of today that 
stand between man and his attainment of a viable social 
structure.
<p>
Ignorance engendered fear and the attribution of supernatural 
powers to mystical spirits, other inhabitants of the Earth and 
imagined fearful beings,  Unreasonable fear furthered the initial 
capitulation to authoritarian power -- to the chieftain and the 
witch doctor, and authoritarian power demands idolatry, the control 
over mind and body, the suppression of knowledge, the observance 
of ritual and adherence to doctrine supported by intimidation and 
force.
<p>
The Neolithic Age, around 4000 B.C., was witness to the formation 
of a ruthless, authoritarian socio-cultural system based upon 
economic slavery, the Price System.  Since its inception it has 
ruled all civil society, from the era of the great urban cultures 
of antiquity, the church/state of the Sumerian and Egyptian 
dynasties, the Greco and Holy Roman Empires, to today's American 
imperialism.
<p>
Of great significance, the system's ruling power structure over 
the millennia has in part maintained its authority by means of 
indoctrination and the distortion of language.  Some of the 
language that has been implanted in the human mind are abstract 
political concepts that can mean whatever you want them to mean.  
Words that are divorced from reality such as: democracy, 
capitalism, free enterprise, socialism, communism and others -- 
liberty, freedom, justice and equality, that comprise the many 
devices of Price System social control.  Absolutism has produced 
an ideology whereunder there is a dimming of the discrepancy 
between fact and falsehood.
<p>
We present our society as being democratic, holding to an ideal of 
equality, when in reality our proclaimed principles are abandoned 
for the credo of the Price system whose axiom was defined by a 
20th century satirist as "Das Kapital uber Alles," ("money rules 
over everything").  This is a restatement of the concept of 
centralized power by an elitist plutocracy, as envisioned by 
Alexander Hamilton and his coterie and that is still enforced to 
this day.  It has created America's dynasties of power, wealth, 
luxury and fashion: America's apartheid, separating the "Beasts" 
from the gentry, a society of privilege.
<p>
What is it that we esteem and cultivate?  The basic biological and 
physical needs of humanity upon the North American Continent can 
be met -- within the constraint of natural laws and the Earth's 
finite resources.  The resources exist to provide for an 
intellectual environment out of which an age of reason and 
enlightenment can be born.  Why has it not come into existence?
<p>
In the days of Cromwell, the concept was held "that only the 
freeholders constituted the body politic, and that they could use 
their property as they pleased, uncontrolled by any obligations to 
any superior or by the need of consulting the mass of men -- who 
were mere tenants at will, with no fixed interest or share in the 
land of the kingdom."  It made the landed gentry omnipotent.  This 
same viewpoint prevailed in the writing of the U.S. Constitution, 
as the former colonial freeholders conceived the legislative 
branch of the Senate as protecting only property rights.  The Senate's 
members were not subject to "the imprudence of democracy" until 
the 17th amendment, May 31, 1913.
<p>
The Constitution granted a priority right to those who equate the 
concept of property and ownership with the power and privilege to 
exploit as a right of property.  This also applied to the ruthless 
exploitation of humans as the prime energy resource in the 
evolution of the Price System.  Ten American presidents were 
slaveholders.  George Washington owned 216 slaves in 1773; Patrick 
Henry, the "voice" of the revolution who said "Give me liberty, or 
give me death" owned 65 slaves at the time of his death; Thomas 
Jefferson, the "pen" of the revolution had 185 slaves in 1809; 
James Madison at one time had 116 slaves.  The list continues.
<p>
Following the master-race traditions of slavery and supremacy, of 
past centuries and congruent with the fascism of 20th century 
Europe and Asia; the exploitation of women and children in the 
textile mills; the child labor on the farms, in the mines and 
factories; these were the corollary of the Bill of Rights for the 
disfranchised; these were the realities of free enterprise, 
liberty, freedom, justice and equality.  These were the misnomers 
of democracy.
<p>
In 1990, Afro-Americans seek "freedom now"; women petition for 
their long-denied rights of economic equality; American labor has 
fallen victim of the "the rust belt", technological innovations 
and the machinations of multinational corporations. Data of the 
U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reveal that, in 1973, 
manufacturing jobs accounted for 24.8 percent of total U.S. 
civilian employment.  By 1988, it had tumbled to 18.5 percent.  
31.7 million Americans in our nation exist in poverty, as 
identified by the Census Bureau.
<p>
The aforementioned serves only as a minute illustration of 
economic slavery, its continuity and enforcement over the 
centuries.  In our society the status of every individual, every 
class, is a function of property relations as advocated by our 
forebears.  The Price System, subordinating as it does all human 
rights and human welfare to property rights, is impersonal, 
nonhuman and nonethical in character.  It represents "not simply 
the pursuit of purposeless materialism" but a deeper competition 
for power and prestige, translated into domination and status.
<p>
In the late 1800s and the early 20th century, "an economic 
revolution raised up a new ruling class in America.  The 
industrialists and the investment bankers now sat in the seats of 
power formerly held by southern planters, northeastern merchants, 
and by members of the old aristocracy of inherited wealth."  By 
1892 there were now more than 4000 millionaires, many of whom came 
to power through a ruthless disregard for the public welfare, as 
evidenced by Commodore Vanderbilt's proclaimed arrogance, "What 
do I care about the law? Hain't I got the power?"
<p>
Most of the elitist power structure, financial, industrial, 
political, theological and military proclaimed to our naive 
ancestors that an omnipotent power gave sanction to their monies, 
crowns and parchments, including their declarations of war.  Those 
ancestors confirmed this fraud, and we do so to this day; it is a 
distorted philosophy.  A cynicism, expressed by a U.S. budget 
director in the 20th century, and said to have been learned by him 
in the Divinity school at Harvard, that "there is no morality, 
and therefore, there can be no immoral policy" typifies 
America's political corruptions of this century.
<p>
Having laid claim to the public domain, the malefactors of debt 
increased the magnitude of their operations.  American industry 
and banking moved toward greater consolidation through trusts, 
holding companies and monopolies that later were to culminate in 
today's multinationals.  (As a typification, in 1913 the Morgan-
Rockefeller empire held, in all, 341 directorships in 122 
corporations.)
<p>
This new concentration of power was now directed by various 
corporations to the control over America's finite natural 
resources, its technologies and operative facilities.  Among the 
energy and mineral resources were oil, coal, natural gas, iron 
ore, copper, aluminum, etc.  Operating facilities, as an example, 
were transportation, oil refineries and electric power.  The 
avaricious exploitation of these natural resources made America a 
"have-not nation" at the conclusion of World War II.
<p>
Now, there emerges into clear view America's military and economic 
cliques that have combined into what can only be described as the 
consolidation of all the prior exploitive rackets into a global 
monopoly.  It dwarfs all past fascist attempts at conquest.  An 
uncontrolled corrupt authority has arisen on our Continent, an 
authority who has assumed the rights of sovereignty, usurping a 
governance that we are trained to believe is residing in the 
people.
<p>
Those who have exploited for profit and power have misused the 
environment and its resources upon which our survival and standard 
of living depend.  They promote a system based upon exponential 
growth on a finite Earth, and this cannot continue without our 
destruction.
<p>
Our society depends on energy, without energy the technology of 
production is silent; without the wealth of natural resources, 
both energy and the productive mechanism are meaningless; without 
the freedom to participate in the consumption of the production 
made possible by the natural resources, energy and technology, 
life is impossible, and equality, liberty, freedom, the pursuit of 
happiness and peace are expressions of ignorance, arrogance and 
hypocrisy.
<p>
North America can no longer be occupied by a high energy, highly 
complex technological civilization on a haphazard, planless basis, 
nor under governmental direction by the functionally illiterate.  
We must plan for survival!
<p>
The forethought of Technocracy, under the guiding direction of 
Howard Scott and the research of the Technical Alliance, has taken 
science out of the laboratory to provide a plan for a new social 
order beyond anything the world has yet known.  With knowledge, 
wisdom and dedication, there is hardly a limit to what the human 
species may creatively achieve!
<p>
Technocracy is a new system of governance, a Technate, a 
government of function, and is the next peaceful evolutionary step 
in America's destiny.  It is the total scientific coordination of 
all the physical functions essential for the needs and survival of 
humankind, and it is necessary for the development of a 
civilization worthy of the intelligence of humankind on this North 
American Continent.  Its administration is organized for the 
control of the physical factors of a social area for functional 
purposes, not for the control of people.  These functions are 
designed not only to fulfill human needs, but to be in harmony 
with the ecological environment and its biotic potential.
<p>
The elements exist to serve a new creative and fulfilling doctrine 
of life that can transcend any written record of humanity.  Life 
can be for the first time realized as an exuberant and fulfilling 
celebration.  The decision is yours to make.
