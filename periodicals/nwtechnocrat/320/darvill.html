...The environment band wagon is beginning to roll, and some 
strange groups are clambering aboard.  Recently at a gathering 
held at the Mall in Washington D.C., which was called EarthTec 90, 
who the participants were was interesting to say the least.  Among 
them was Waste Management, the largest publicly held company in 
the waste business; one of its affiliates is facing a $44.5 
million fine for improperly burning hazardous wastes.  DuPont is 
the producer of Freon and other hazardous chemicals.  Ciba-Geigy 
was indicted in 1985 on thirty-five counts connected to illegal 
dumping on its landfill in Toms River, New Jersey and in the 
Atlantic Ocean.  Browning Ferris Industries (B.F.I.), another 
giant in the waste management business, in March was fined $1.55 
million for 1,400 hazardous waste disposal violations at a 
Louisiana facility.  The smell of money is in the air; "cleaning 
up the environment", "save the planet", what stirring phrases to 
convince the gullible public to part with their money.  Earth Day 
has come and gone; many prominent citizens put in an appearance at 
events across the land, arriving in limousines, and then, having 
done their duty, returned to their lavish homes and heated 
swimming pools, secure in the knowledge that they had played their 
part in saving the planet.  It will become a boondoggle of major 
proportions, and, despite spending over a trillion dollars in an 
effort to control pollution, little has been accomplished.  
Standard pollution emissions such as dust, sulphur-dioxide, 
carbon-monoxide, carbon-dioxide and nitrogen-oxides have declined 
by only 18% since 1975, and not at all since 1982.
<p>
...For each gallon of gasoline it consumes, every automobile now 
on the road produces nearly 20 pounds of carbon-dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>).  In 
total, automobiles in the United States annually produce 677 
million tons of CO<sub>2</sub>, an amount equal to the annual output of 170 
typical coal-fired electrical generating plants.  Oil imports have 
risen from 37% of the oil consumed in the U.S. in the early 1980s 
to over 46% in 1989, and are expected to surpass 50% within the 
next few years.  In 1989, cars, trucks and other U.S. 
transportation activities consumed 3.6 billion barrels of crude 
oil, 36% more oil than the total of all domestic petroleum 
production.  This oil-use accounted for more than 27% of all U.S. 
energy consumption and is equal to over five times the maximum 
annual capacity of the Alaskan oil pipeline.  Automobiles consume 
the greatest share of this energy, accounting for almost 41% of 
all the fuel used for transportation activities in 1989.  The 
above is contained in a report issued by Public Citizen, Critical 
Mass Energy Project, Washington, D.C.
<p>
...An ominous bill is being prepared in the Canadian House of 
Commons; it is Bill C-15 The Plant Breeders Rights Act.  It will 
allow plant breeders to obtain patents on plant material that they 
develop.  The government likes it because funding for research and 
development would be shifted to the private sector.  The companies 
like it because they will collect royalties on plant material that 
they will have patents on.  Vic Althouse, MP (member of 
parliament) for MacKenzie District in Saskatchewan states, "Profit 
will be the chief driving force; it will not be finding a better 
plant."  What follows plant patenting? -- animal patenting, then 
human tissue patenting.  This is another indication of government 
furthering the interests of business to the detriment of the 
general well-being.  It makes one wonder how many other secret 
protocols are being worked out by government officials which will 
benefit business enterprise to the detriment of the general-well-
being.
<p>
...In the early 1920s, the Technical Alliance, the research group 
which preceded the organization Technocracy Inc., and upon whose 
findings the design of Technocracy is based, introduced the Energy 
Certificate to effect a means of distribution based upon the use 
of energy as a means of measuring production and distribution.  
For the details of this method we refer the reader to the 
Technocracy publication "The Energy Certificate".  While the 
"Energy Certificate" specifications spelled out the concepts of a 
proper distribution system, there have been continual improvements 
in the technology.  There is now a product called Lasercard and it 
employs a technique known as WORM (write once, read many) -- that 
is, whatever is etched into its memory is there forever.  The card 
will hold up to 2.6 megabytes of information; that is about 1,000 
typed pages.  It could keep track of all the information required, 
health records, driver's license, address and all information 
necessary for a distribution system based on energy.  In other 
words it will do all of the things required of the Energy 
Certificate.  As first stated by Technocracy, "The Energy 
Certificate" would be much more efficient and practical then the 
medium of exchange we refer to as money.  It would make the 
distribution of abundance possible, eliminate the archaic Price 
System and enable many of today's serious problems to be dealt 
with.
<p>
...There is a great difference between what is achieved and what 
is achievable.  Even if we consider the best aspects of our 
present society, it falls far short of what it could be capable 
of.  We will never achieve our potential, much less solve our 
growing social problems within the framework of the obsolescent 
Price System. As long as monetary expedience is our prime 
consideration, the problems we now face will become more serious 
and complex.  We must concern ourselves with function; we must 
operate things as they were designed; we must so order our 
physical equipment that it will bring about the greatest possible 
amount of material benefits and freedom for all.  We must organize 
our technology to benefit mankind -- not to destroy him, and the 
Technocracy design for an abundant life makes this possible.  
INVESTIGATE IT.
