Our present understanding has it that water molecules when heated 
begin to move, their movement becoming more erratic with increased 
heat.  Perhaps our society is like that, if we consider the 
pressure of events to correspond to heat.  At least it seems so.  
Society was pretty tranquil following World War II; people had 
their lives laid out for the most part, and those who didn't were 
not complaining too loudly.  The dissidents of the 60s had only a 
far-away attempt at genocide to become excited about, and the 
hungry and dispossessed were fairly quiet.  If we stay with our 
metaphor; the water was only warm.
<p>
But, perhaps, events could warm us to an uncomfortable degree; it 
begins to appear that that is probable -- and in the not too 
distant future.  People may have an unsettled feeling about 
warnings of changes in the offing, but they can still tell 
themselves that those bad things will surely pass if we just hang 
in there.
<p>
But, farmers without farms, steelworkers with no steel mill, 
loggers without trees, miners without a mine and people generally, 
are finding that they must compete with their children for jobs 
making hamburgers; they are beginning to talk -- and loudly.  
There is something wrong; the heat is increasing.
<p>
There is a tendency in people to persevere, to stubbornly persist 
in doing what once was a rewarding effort and then to get angry 
and destructive -- not good!  This situation is a situation of a 
different kind, one requiring intelligence and concerted action on 
a different level than that of a mob.
<p>
One of our difficulties here is that, from birth, we have had to 
live in a melange of adversarial relationships.  To live we have 
had to take from someone else before that person got around to 
taking from us.  This taking can be disguised very cleverly -- all 
of us living in this Price System should have come to realize that 
by now.  Anyway, the potential for social disturbance is growing.  
Rage can replace compliant submission with just a little 
additional insult or oppression.  And, with conditions worsening, 
when the heat really comes on, the potential for a loss of our 
civilization because of irrational behavior on the part of a 
people with no positive direction, is real.
<p>
Think of it!  If everyone voted one way or another, would that 
give the public a positive goal?  No!  What if everyone joined 
some particular church?  Would the problems causing our difficulty 
ease?  Again no!  Just suppose any group you can think of had 
their way.  Would things change for the better?  You should know 
better than that.
<p>
What is needed is for us all to have a social goal that we want to 
work for; we need a social context where we don't have to keep our 
backs to the wall for protection; we need to be able to plan 
eagerly for the future.  What we really need is to replace this 
system that is causing all the trouble with one that can give us 
a future with security.  We need to be able to control the heat 
that is warming our backsides.  That heat is coming from an 
obsolete social system.  There is no evil personality doing his 
thing that is giving us trouble; it is our social system that is 
"out of sync" with technology that will increasingly become 
dangerous and otherwise unsatisfactory.
<p>
We can control the heat that is bothering us by learning how to 
properly control technology, and we can only do that in a proper 
social system -- Technocracy.
