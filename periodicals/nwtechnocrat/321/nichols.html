North Americans have been taught since childhood to believe that 
their country, their political system, their economy and their 
opinions are the best in the world.  They enjoy their pride in 
their own accomplishments.  And to convince the doubters, they are 
quick to provide examples of failure in the social operations of 
other countries.  It's nice to be best, but that's no excuse for 
making no further improvements.  So what if we are the best?  This 
alone is no great reason for satisfaction when one considers the 
state of the world and the present behavior patterns of its 
people. The fact is, nowhere on this planet is there a society 
which is operated as the result of an intelligent effort to 
deliberately design a social mechanism for the benefit of man.  We 
have reached our present state chiefly through the haphazard 
efforts of individuals attempting to maneuver themselves into 
positions of advantage over others.  This approach has been used 
all through the ages past, and only recently have there been any 
indications of possible improvement.  This becomes obvious when 
one stops listening to what we say about ourselves and actually 
examines what we are doing to ourselves and to others.
<p>
All countries, all societies in the world today have their 
problems, in Africa, Argentina, Central America, China, and yes, 
even in the United States.  We all have problems, serious social 
and economic problems, which result in social instability.  A 
tidal wave of dissatisfaction is building up in the world today.  
All the earth's people want a higher living standard, a better 
life for themselves and their children.  The result is the present 
protest movements and the scramble for more technology, the same 
type of technology which has given North Americans, or at least 
some North Americans, better living conditions.  Unfortunately, 
with the present state of knowledge, the earth doesn't have the 
necessary physical ability to provide a North American type of 
living standard for 5.2 billion people.
<p>
It doesn't matter what type of politico-economic system a country 
may have, if it doesn't have the physical requirements for the 
production of the needed goods and services, then it can't supply 
the needs of its population.  Under these conditions, it becomes 
the function of the "system" to decide who gets how much of what.  
A high living standard does not consist of ideals, beliefs or 
opinions; it cannot be distributed by any political or economic 
system in a country which hasn't the physical requirements for the 
production required.  Political or economic idealogy is not what a 
high living standard consists of.  What is required is food that 
is grown on that nation's farms, clothes which are technologically 
woven from fibers, housing which is made from lumber from the 
forests, bricks made from clay, steel, aluminum and glass.  A high 
living standard is not produced by any political method known to 
man.  The function of a political government is not to produce 
anything.  It is to interfere with the production process, to 
interfere with the distribution process, and to act as a referee 
to determine who gets the most or the least.
<p>
Any nation which can't produce enough for all its people has no 
choice but to operate according to the dictates of an economy of 
scarcity.  A scarcity economy is a method for controlling the 
distribution of goods and services under scarcity conditions.  
During the long history of man, such a method has been developed, and 
it affects this distribution by a system of trade, or commerce 
based on commodity valuation determined by the relative scarcity 
of the items to be traded.  This method is called a "Price System" 
since the scarcity values are expressed in terms of price.  A 
Price System is now in use in every nation in the world.
<p>
A scarcity economy is almost certainly the only type of economy 
the world has ever known; it is the only type of economy possible 
in any area which hasn't the physical ability to produce plenty 
for all its citizens.  Throughout recorded history the methods 
which make up the Price System have been tinkered with, laws have 
been passed or repealed, sometimes controversies resulted in wars, 
but the Price System always ends up benefiting the few at the 
expense of the many.  However many changes have been made in the 
past, however many political methods have been tried, this system 
for the distribution of a scarcity has remained intact.  It 
remains today in every country on earth.
<p>
Only when a land-area that has the necessary natural resources 
develops the required technology will that land-area have the 
physical abiltiy to produce plenty for all its citizens.  When 
that happens, it then becomes necessary for that land-area to 
replace its scarcity economy, its Price System, with a system 
designed to distribute that plenty to it's people.  And what a 
chore that will be.  North America is there!  Every citizen who 
has been educated to believe in a scarcity operation, every 
"successful" entrepreneur who has "got ahead" and made a fortune 
for himself in the Price System will resist any change.  One would 
be naive to expect a whole nation of people to suddenly wake up to 
the fact that this continent can now produce plenty and therefore 
is ready to make the transition from a scarcity economy to an 
economy of plenty.  All institutions, all the ideals, beliefs and 
opinions, all the traditions for thousands of years in the past 
were based on the scarcity conditions existing throughout that 
time.  Those have been the only conditions ever known by man.  All 
the cultural concepts are suddenly antiquated, and man will find it 
extremely difficult to adjust himself to the new conditions even 
though it would constitute the greatest single event ever to 
occur to mankind for his physical benefit.  A leadership with far 
more intelligence than any of the world's existing political 
parties is required to provide the direction for the installation 
of an economy of plenty.
<p>
These conclusions concerning the social behavior of North 
America's citizenry are not based on some mythical or idealistic 
nonsense, they are based on observation of the behavior patterns 
in the United States and Canada for the past half century.  During 
this time, these two countries have had the technology, the natural
resources and the trained technical personnel to provide plenty for
every North American citizen.  And what has happened?
<p>
Everything possible has been done to sabotage the abundance this
Continent could produce in order to maintain the scarcity required for
the continued operation of a scarcity economy.  Everyone knows farm
products have been bought up with taxpayer money and destroyed,
shipped abroad, plowed under, allowed to rot in warehouses, and
farmers have been paid to produce less.  This has 
been going on since the early 1930s.  Planned obsolescence of 
manufactured goods has been in widespread use during this same 
period.  And we still have some 32 million Americans living in 
poverty, which proves that maintaining this scarcity economy is 
considered more important to citizens of this Continent than 
eliminating poverty, homelessness, crime and drugs.  The press has 
often reported these activities, but never does it point out that 
this Continent can produce plenty for all, and that a scarcity 
economy is no longer necessary nor desirable for the North 
American people, nor does it ever point out that any other type of 
economic system is possible.  Only the non-profit organization of 
Technocracy Inc. has, for more than 50 years, tried to give the 
people of this Continent an engineered design for an economy of 
plenty.  But how often do you see anything about Technocracy in 
the daily press or on TV?
<p>
Why do we collectively ignore this opportunity for a great 
civilization?  Everyone wants plenty for himself, but few are 
willing to consider changing the antiquated social, economic and 
political methods of the past.  Few are willing, or able, to make 
an intelligent effort to understand the physical requirements for 
the production and the distribution of plenty to all North 
Americans that would eliminate poverty, homelessness, crime, 
debt, drugs and the present environmental degradation by 
eliminating the system which causes these evils.  Where is the 
land of the free and home of the brave?  Where is the great North 
American courage to fight for what's "right" when it comes to 
solving these problems?  Where are those who believe in freedom to 
use what we can produce, and where are those who believe in the 
distribution of plenty to the citizens of this Continent?  Where 
are those who believe in the freedom of the press to publish the 
necessary blueprint for the distribution of plenty?  And where 
have they been for the past half century?
<p>
If the citizens of this Continent are unable to provide the 
intelligence and the will to inform themselves concerning the 
requirements of an economy of plenty, then there is little chance 
that the transition can be made without the chaos which will 
probably result when this Price System can no longer be made to 
operate.  Already the crime rate is increasing as more people 
can't make it legally and turn to crime.  Our jails are full and 
overflowing; the drug business has overwhelmed the police in many 
areas of the country.  Many Savings and Loans have folded as a 
result of financial crimes or poor management, the debt structure 
is beyond repair, and if we continue fouling up the only 
environment which can sustain life, this planet will soon be dead.  
This trend may be expected to continue until we, the citizens of 
this Continent, are willing to correct the condition which causes 
such behavior.
<p>
Technocracy does not ask anyone to believe anything.  However, it 
does suggest that if the North American people are to solve their 
social and economic problems for the benefit of all citizens, then 
they must make some great and unprecedented changes in their own 
social concepts.  They must learn to depend on factual information 
rather than political rhetoric.  The transition from a culture 
based on scarcity to a culture based on plenty is not a problem 
which will solve itself automatically.  It will be necessary for 
people who have the intellegence, the will and the necessary 
factual information to provide the leadership for the survival of 
the species.  It must be the people -- living here and now because 
no one else can.  Think about it.  Then look into Technocracy's 
Technological Social Design.
