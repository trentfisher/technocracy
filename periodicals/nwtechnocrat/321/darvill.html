If you have attitudes similar to those held by most people, you 
probably know as much as you care to know about the mess this 
country, this continent or, indeed, the world is in.  In that 
case, then solutions are what you like to hear about.  But, if you 
don't understand the problem in the first place, then no matter 
how you try to bring about a solution, the problem remains.  And if 
the cause of that problem remains intact, attempts to solve it 
will fail.  We are attacking the problems confronting our society 
today with many groups only attacking symptoms.   There are people 
who want to conserve our trees; there are people who want to 
conserve our farmland; there are people who are concerned about 
animal's rights, about crime, about war, about the fact that we 
are rapidly running out of fish-stock, farmland, soil erosion -- 
and all of of those people are well-intentioned; all of them are 
very sincere in their efforts to overcome the problems that they 
are concerned about, but they are only attacking symptoms, the 
symptoms of a basic problem which is the Price System.
<p>
A Price System is any social system that affects the distribution 
of goods and services by means of commodity evaluation, that is, 
that employs any form of debt token or money.  The cause of very 
nearly all the social problems confronting us today is the Price 
System, an obsolescent social system out of step with technology, 
a system that  is no longer capable of taking care of the needs of 
the people now residing in this particular land area.
<p>
People are preoccupied with symptoms because of profit; and 
realistically speaking, preserving our problems is more profitable 
than intelligent management.  The lumber industry for example has 
far more power, far more clout in this system, than the people who 
are vociferously acting against the indiscriminate cutting of the 
forest that is occurring on a large scale.  Ardent 
conservationists  talk in terms of cutting back on a major scale, 
but when the effect on the economy is pointed out, they back down 
very quickly, because they are thinking in Price System terms and 
are primarily concerned with maintaining a monetary system; 
economic considerations take priority over everything we do.  Our 
concern for the forests, our concern about over-fishing, our 
concern about pollution, our concern about water depletion, about 
soil erosion, all of these concerns are basically economic in 
nature, and when we talk about solutions or in any way think of 
applying solutions we always come to this one stumbling block 
"money."   We don't think from a point-of-view of a long-term 
civilization and how our acts will affect future generations; we 
think about the here and now, the economic consequences of what we 
may or may not do to overcome social problems today.
<p>
Now let us briefly look back at what we have accomplished from the 
Price System point-of-view.  We are in the last decade of the 
twentieth century, and, when this century began, it was hailed as 
a century of progress.  This was going to be the century when man 
overcame want, when man was to have abundance, when poverty was 
going to be struck from the earth along with malnutrition and all 
the things that have plagued man all through his past history.  
This twentieth century was hailed as the century of progress, and 
here we are in the 1990s having doubts about the survival of the 
human species. This century began with great promise.  Cars and 
locomotives were installed and were operating, although many 
people were concerned about cars and locomotives; they felt that 
if man moved any faster than a horse could travel, it would upset 
his metabolism.  They were afraid of the consequences of 
locomotives, but, nevertheless, automobiles and locomotives had 
become established and people were becoming used to them.  
Perhaps, had they objected more strongly to the introduction of 
automobiles, we would be in a better position today, but, 
nevertheless, progress prevailed.
<p>
In 1903, Henry Ford set up his first production line and cars 
started to roll off the production line in greater numbers.  
Today, the automotive industry accounts for about one in six of 
all jobs in the United States and a similar number in Canada.  At 
the present time many thousands of people are being laid-off in 
the automotive industry because of competition from outside 
interests.  More efficient practices can produce far more cars and 
use far less manpower.  The very efficient mass-transit systems 
which operated in the United States and to a certain extent in 
Canada were dismantled and people were forced into private 
automobiles.  Now we face the situation where, due to rapidly 
diminishing oil supplies, in a very few years we are going to be 
faced with the problem of how to move people from point A to point 
B, because the cost of operating automobiles, probably within the 
next ten years, will become prohibitive.  Technocracy anticipated 
these problems and proposed in the early 1920s the concept of 
mass-transportation.
<p>
In 1903, the Wright brothers flew the first airplane.  It lifted 
off the ground for a few minutes and landed again.  A year later 
they managed to do a complete circle with the same plane.  Now, 
planes that fly at twice the speed of sound are very common.  In 
the short space of 66 years from the time the Wright brothers 
first lifted their aircraft off the ground -- in 66 years we 
placed a man on the Moon.  If the same scientific principles -- 
the application of knowledge -- had been applied to our social 
administration as was applied to the development of aeronautical 
engineering, we would most certainly not be in the position we are 
in today.  In 66 years man made tremendous strides in aeronautical 
engineering by applying the methods of science and technology to 
the problem.  If we had applied those same principles of 
scientific predictability -- to society -- our social 
administration today and the way by which we live would be beyond 
the imaginings of most people.  We would have accomplished far 
more in the fields of social administration than we have done by 
the hit and miss methods that we have used.
<p>
As we moved through this century of progress we came to 1914.  By 
1914, a family squabble in Europe, a squabble between the Royal 
families of Europe, the brothers and sisters that made up the 
crowned heads of Britain, Germany, Austria-Hungary and Russia had 
been squabbling for a number of years about dominance.  The Kaiser 
had large fleets of naval vessels; the British asked him to stop 
and he said he would if the British reduced the size of their 
naval fleet.  One thing led to another, and the First World War 
was under way with  millions of people being slaughtered.
<p>
Near the end of that war, in 1918-1919, a group of scientists, 
engineers and leading economists of the day; Howard Scott was one; 
Thorstein Veblen, the educator, another; Stuart Chase another; 
Charles Steinmetz, the electric engineer of General Electric; and 
others were concerned about what had taken place in the United 
States as a result of the war.  They were concerned about the fact 
that despite the many men that had been inducted into the armed 
services, the productive capacity of the United  States had 
increased.  They wondered why this had occurred and what its 
significance was for the future, so, to know scientifically,  they 
undertook what they termed the Energy Survey of the North 
American Continent.  All of the findings that then took place 
during the fourteen years of research of the Technical Alliance, 
(which they named their organization) was incorporated into the 
present membership organization, Technocracy Inc.  It is upon 
their findings that the present design of Technocracy Inc. came 
into being, and Technocrats have been explaining and trying to 
throw light on a correct analysis and solution of our social 
problems for the last 60 years.  Some of the solutions which could 
have been easily applied during the 1920s when they were first 
introduced by the Technical Alliance could have eliminated 
problems which we face today.  Those problems would never have 
come into being in the first place.  
<p>
One of the ideas that they introduced in the early 1920s was the 
concept of a scientifically designed calendar.  They pointed out 
that, if North America was ever to experience abundance, the only 
way was by operating industry and service sequences for twenty-
four hours a day 365 days a year.  Only under such circumstances 
could North America produce and distribute a true abundance.  On 
this basis they introduced the Technocracy Calendar.  It would 
mean that there would be no severe fluctuations in the load factor 
in the industrial sequences.  The amenities of any given area 
would be available to everybody at any time, and it would level out 
the peak load-factors which are inherent in Price System 
operations today.  The rush-hours, the traffic congestion, many of 
the problems that are common today would not have occurred if the 
Technocracy calendar had been introduced in the 1920s.
<p>
In the 1920s, the United States was still very much a rural community, 
and Canada was almost completely so.  The population was very much 
less than it is today, and we had an abundance of resources and 
manpower plus the technology to apply the new scientific 
techniques.  Building a civilization worthy of the intelligence of 
man was a pleasant prospect.
<p>
Another concept that they introduced in the early 1920s was the 
idea of the Energy Certificate, a central concept in the design 
for Continental operation.  The Energy Certificate is a name 
meaning a distribution system based upon energy accounting,  and 
the significance of this may not occur to people until they they 
think about the concepts for a bit.  Here is a design for a 
society within which we, all of us, can enjoy relative abundance 
as a right of citizenship.  How would this be accomplished?  We 
could have begun with the technology available then, the Dewey 
Decimal system.  Today you can pick up many scientific magazines 
and you will read about Smart Cards.  These cards are no bigger 
than any credit card and all the information necessary about any 
individual, date of birth, where that person was born, sex, 
education,medical history, abilities -- everything that is 
necessary to know about a person can be incorporated now into one 
small card no bigger than a credit card.  This is basically what 
Technocracy, or rather the Technical Alliance, was talking about 
in 1923 when they first introduced the concept of energy 
accounting.  When you think of the mish-mash, the horrible mess we 
are in today involving financial manipulation, it makes you 
appreciate how much easier things would have been and how much 
more efficient if, in those early days when our society was much 
simpler than it is today, intelligent changes had been made.  They 
could have been incorporated very easily.  If the monetary system 
had been abandoned, and the concept of energy accounting had been 
introduced at that time, all of the problems that are related to 
money would not have occurred.
<p>
The Technical Alliance, also proposed in the early 1920s, the 
concept of a Continental Hydrology.  Today, water tables in the 
United States and Canada are being depleted at a very rapid rate.  
What water that does remain is sometimes very badly polluted.  
Salt water is seeping into many ground-water reservoirs in coastal 
areas where the table has dropped low enough to allow seawater in.  
Much of our water is contaminated with pollutants -- pesticides, 
insecticides and airborne pollutants which may come many thousands 
of miles from their source are polluting our ground water.  
Continental Hydrology as proposed by Technocracy is a continental 
design for flood and erosion control, it would supply water for 
power, would supply irrigation and transportation and would open 
up huge areas of the North American Continent for recreational 
areas.  It would modify the climate and allow us to grow food in 
areas that are now considered arid, and, had it been adopted, it 
would most certainly not have resulted in the contamination and 
depletion of our water resources that is a major problem in most
areas of the United States and Canada today.
<p>
Coupled with Continental Hydrology, the concept of Power for a
Continent was also introduced.  This would have meant the transmission
of up to a million volts DC across this Continent of North America.
Power could be brought in from great distances and used without the
difficulty of merging competing utilities are considering ``wheeling
power'' from time zone to time zone.  Continental operation would
handle peak loads in the power system, peak loads
which occur today in so many areas when everybody switches on 
their lights and air conditioners at the same times in the day.  
Many areas today fear brownouts or blackouts, and this is 
inevitable in a Price System, with the competition for profit 
interfering with technology.  
<p>
Also, years ago, Technocracy Inc. outlined the concept of low 
speed water transportation as part of a Continental Hydrology.  
Non-perishable goods could be transported at a cost of one-tenth 
per ton mile -- over any other form of transportation.  The energy 
savings by water trains would be tremendous and is one of many 
practical ways in which the dependence on the automobile could be 
overcome.
<p>
The social design of Technocracy was not implemented half a 
century ago and, as a consequence, we have built an entire 
civilization with wrong-headed thinking.  It will take real effort 
to get ourselves back on track.  Had we been embarked on a 
different course with intelligent direction, we would now have a 
future that would be a pleasure to contemplate.  We would, no 
doubt, have a population in housing that was built to live in, 
located with thought given to conservation of the environment.  
Entire industries would have been placed differently -- with 
thought given to the personnel whose duty it was to operate them.  
It would be usual to travel by rail at speeds of 200 miles an 
hour. Education of the young would not be the "inculcation of the 
incomprehensible into the ignorant by the incompetent."  It would, 
instead, be the best preparation for living that could be 
achieved.  Health-care would be unhindered instead of in the hands 
of people who would like to help you, but who must remember their 
role of predator along with their professional role.
<p>
Pointing out what could have been had we been intelligent is 
useless, except that it still could be -- only now we have 
problems, and some of the problems are real sticky.  And, some of 
the problems facing the people of this Continent will, without 
question, multiply and magnify if they are handled by Price System 
techniques.
<p>
But, there is no problem facing us today that cannot be solved; we 
still have the resources; we have the technology; we have the 
trained personnel to apply that technology to its maximum 
efficiency, and there is no practical reason why all of the major 
social problems and environmental problems confronting us at the 
present time cannot be overcome, but they cannot or will not be 
overcome within the framework of a Price System.  People have got to 
make up their minds what it is they want, a healthy economy or a 
healthy environment, because we can't, by any stretch of the 
imagination, have both. One is incompatible with the other.
<p>
Solutions to our social problems are not unattainable.  There is 
nothing facing us today, collectively and as a civilization, which 
modern-day technology cannot overcome if that technology is 
applied as it was designed to be used; if it is applied correctly 
and for the benefit of people in general.  The problems we face 
today, or most of them, are of a technological nature and will 
vanish.  The material benefit which would result from such an 
operation would bring the standard of living of every North 
American far above what we have today, but we have to make up our 
minds about what we want and what we want for our children.  Do we 
want them to live in a world in which they can breathe clean air 
and drink unpolluted water, enjoy nutritious food and a healthy 
environment, or do we want to see how much longer this Price 
System can be dragged out?  Sooner or later, when the resources 
run out, when the population becomes so great that this planet can 
no longer sustain the vast numbers, then Mother Nature will take a 
hand.  And, if we don't supply intelligent solutions in the 
meantime, we certainly won't like the solutions which she will 
apply to us.
