Recently, on a national talk show that debated the role of women 
in the work-place and in the home, one gentleman on the panel of 
opinion-aters, stated his view in no uncertain terms.  His 
stringent advocacy was that females should stay home and do 
the thing they do best, he said, which was to have babies.  If not 
that, then they should only have jobs of clerical and other lessor 
positions in business and industry.  Never should they be allowed 
to have corporate jobs of any considerable importance.  He stated, 
further, that women have become too independent and that they 
should return to a former state, "enjoyed" by them previously -- 
that of being primarily a helper to men.
<p>
This gentleman represented a kind of stereotype common in such 
social debates that are typically futile and only about symptoms 
being kicked around in the developing "wars" between male and 
female, the old vs. the young, pro-lifers vs. pro-choice, blacks 
vs. whites, gays vs. straights, law & order enthusiasts, and other 
arguments of this nature that provide only social diversions, thus 
inhibiting focus on basic causes of these and other social 
problems.  What this results in is a waste of the time and effort 
that goes into dealing only with symptoms.  All this is done for 
the cause of "human rights", an abstraction that only can have 
real meaning in a social structure that provides its citizens with 
economic security, peace and with so few social problems that they 
become less interesting as subjects of dispute.  Modern science 
and technology is now capable of producing social tranquility but 
is prevented from doing so by social ignorance and indifference.
<p>
When the majority of the audience on the show made fun of the man 
who was unable to recognize the changing role of women in this 
century, they were simply looking into a mirror at themselves.  
For, what was really represented by the gentleman, as well as by 
all the people engaged in the social debates mentioned, was people 
living with 18th century social concepts in the 1990s, 
anachronisms with an inability to bring their social thinking up-
to-date and to recognize the role of science and technology in 
bringing about the vast changes in work: the basic reason for all 
the symptomatic conditions -- that are viewed as the basic 
problem.
<p>
We will find, as events relating to the economy and the 
environment proceed toward economic stagnation, that we can no 
longer hide behind an 1800s mentality while living in the year 
1990.  Hiding the real enemy, the archaic Price System we live in 
and cannot understand, is the basic cause of our social problems.  
Those debates are social diversions and are an evasive response to 
the real enemy, the Price System.  Ignorance and fear create the 
resistance to social change, and this subject is what needs 
illumination.  One writer summed up the situation as the power of 
monetary compulsion, when he said, "Damn the facts -- full greed 
ahead."
<p>
There is a scientific solution to the social problems that worry 
people -- Technocracy.
