"The reason why America finds herself in her present agony is 
because for many years she has been ignoring physical laws which 
are fundamental to her operation.  Her present troubles are only 
another warning that the final day of reckoning is at hand.  To 
say it one way, the cause of our troubles lies in the fact that 
during these years, instead of thinking of our well-being and of 
the operation of our country in terms of energy, we have thought 
of it in terms of something purchasable with dollars.  If we are 
to understand the problem at all we have to grapple with this 
question of energy; upon it everything else rests.
<p>
"It is the fact that all forms of energy may be measured in units 
of ergs, joules, or calories that is of the utmost importance.  
The solution of the social problems of our time depends upon the 
recognition of this fact.  A dollar may be worth -- in buying 
power -- so much today and more or less tomorrow, but a unit of 
work or heat is the same in 1900, 1929, 1933, or the year 2000.  
In a Price System, wealth is produced only by the creation of 
debt. A man is wealthy only when he is a creditor.  If his wealth 
consists of bonds, stocks, mortgages, notes, equities, and so 
forth, he is merely the owner of a collection of promises to pay.  
Even currency is in this category, for you will find on the face 
of a dollar bill the words 'payable to the bearer on demand' -- 
with no questions asked as to how he happened to be the bearer.
<p>
"The units in which these forms of debt appear -- be they stocks, 
bonds or currency -- are units of value.  Value cannot be 
measured; it has no metrical equivalent.  A pound of coal is 
always a pound of coal, but the weight of a dollar's worth of coal 
is seldom twice the same.
<p>
"In the past, man was the chief engine and -- except for his draft 
animals and a few water wheels and windmills -- the only engine.  
By contrast, the largest single modern turbine has a capacity of 
300,000 horsepower, or 3 million times the output of a human being 
on an eight hour basis.  But since that turbine runs twenty-four 
hours a day, its total output is 9 million times that of one man.  
In other words, the output of four of these turbines is equal to 
the energy output of all the adult workers of the United 
States....A point was reached where technical improvements began 
to displace men....At the point where the rate of replacement of 
men by machines exceeded the expansion of the industry, a maximum 
of employment in the industry was reached and thereafter 
declined....And as the machines move forward, men with their 
trades and skills are left behind.
<p>
"Under our present Price System, we manufacture goods not to use 
but to sell -- and make a profit; and profit is a debt claim.  
When the great period of American industrial expansion began we 
had a huge frontier, the west was undeveloped, we could make use 
of a great increase in population.  The opportunity for this 
expansion was so great that for a period of years we could make 
any number of mistakes and still escape the consequences.  Then, 
little by little, a horror began to appear.  So swift was the 
advance of technology that machines and plants began to go out of 
date before we had got to a point where the debt incurred to buy 
them might be paid....To make a profit we borrowed, to pay what 
we borrowed we borrowed more, twice; we then borrowed all over 
again.
<p>
"A careful examination of the debt figures and the production 
figures of this country (and these figures have been repeatedly 
checked and cannot be brushed aside) reveals the appalling fact 
that for years our debts have been increasing at a rate faster 
than production and both of them faster then the rate of 
population growth!
<p>
"Modern industry is operated under the Price System, and to be 
successful it must do one thing: it must make a profit and pay a 
return on the money invested.  Forgetting all other considerations 
for a moment, the amount of profit depends on the quantity of 
goods that can be sold.  That is the reason for the incessant cry 
for trade expansion abroad and at home.  On the other hand, inside his
plant the producer has found that his profit increases if he cuts the
cost of production, and that the surest way to do this is by producing
on a large scale by means as automatic as possible--in other words
with machines.  A producer does not install machines in order to give
his employees more leisure; he uses machines because they multiply,
many times over, the output of which his employees were capable and at
a faster and much cheaper 
rate.  It is only lately that people have observed that the 
producer is putting out a most sinister profitless product -- 
unemployment....
<p>
"It happens that industrial investment is made for the most part 
by a very small fraction of our population, and the return on that 
investment must be put somewhere.  It has been argued that this 
interest and dividend return goes into circulaion again, but this 
is exactly what does not happen.  The small investing fraction of 
our population cannot possibly spend all their interest and 
dividends, and the result is that this return must be reinvested 
in production.  There is nothing else to do with it.
<p>
"Why is it that with all the available sources of energy in 
America the Price System will not work?  The reason is that the 
Price System demands that the price of labor be high enough to buy 
the goods produced.  The use of technology (in) industry sets 
three things in conflict with the system itself:
<ol>
  <li>The mechanics of placing purchasing power in the hands of 
      the consumer is the exchange of money for the consumer's 
      time (or labor) and technology is reducing the total amount 
      of time required.
  <li>The working of the Price System has forced the manufacturer 
      to reduce the total number employed rather than to 
      distribute the amount of time required among the total 
      number of available workers.  Technology has now advanced to 
      a point where it has substituted extraneous energy for man-
      hours on an equal basis and where the distribution of human 
      labor becomes impossible.
  <li>Through increased investment in machines -- made necessary 
      by the increasing rate at which they go out of date -- the 
      manufacturer is forced to reduce the proportion of his costs 
      which go to labor.  This again inexorably worked against the 
      increase of wages and the distribution of time.
</ol>
<p>
"In other words, a Price System demands man-power (with a wage) if 
it is to succeed, and man-power for production steadily becomes 
more and more a thing of the past as the kilowatt-hour takes its 
place....
<p>
"On a population basis this country has a capacity of 3,600,000 
horse-power [1990 figure is 7,383,000].  But the country is not 
run on such a basis.  Technology has stepped this capacity up to a 
billion horse-power [1990 figure is 33,000,000,000], and it is 
this tremendous power let loose which is battering the Price 
System to pieces.  Yet we cannot voluntarily cease the use of this 
energy, for we have now gone so far that our very lives depend 
upon it....Seven percent of the available energy is used in the 
provision of food.  The other 93 percent goes to keep our society 
going.  A close calculation estimates that if we shut off our 
coal, oil, electric and water power, a large percentage of us 
would be dead in twenty days....So highly integrated a mechanism 
has our country become with its very life dependent upon the 
smooth and continuous operation of our electricity, steam and 
water power, our coal, oil and gas that the blunderings of an 
Insull, the clumsy smashings of bankers are little short of 
murderous.  A chemist in the laboratory of an oil company can 
examine the sample of a certain grade of gasoline and tell you in 
figures that will never change exactly the maximum number of heat 
units that can be extracted from that grade.  He can measure 
exactly, and that exact measurement is absolutely necessary in 
running our system.  But can the sales manager in the office next 
to the laboratory tell you the exact price of gas next month, next 
year, or ten years hence?  It is absolutely impossible.  We are 
playing with dynamite when we attempt to harness the system to 
price.
<p>
"The supreme fault of the banker is not that his aims are sordid 
or that his appetite is rapacious.  The trouble is that he is 
hopelessly out of date.
<p>
"We have heard a good deal in the past...about underconsumption, 
but it has occurred to but few people that it isn't what a people 
produce that proves their wealth, it is what they consume.  Wealth 
is the conversion of available energy into use forms, be it 
potatoes, shoes, or electric light.  The process of being wealthy 
consists in using up -- not wasting -- the products which, 
through the use of energy, we are able to make.  The United 
States is the most nearly self-sufficient geographical and 
industrial unit on the face of the earth.
<p>
(Figures available in 1933: We have 50% of the coal reserves of 
the world and 40% of the iron ore.  We produce and consume more 
than 69% of the world's oil.  We are the greatest producer and 
consumer of natural gas -- 85% of the world's total.  We occupy 
3,400,000 square miles of land area -- have 6.2% of world 
population and produce approximately 50% of the world's energy.)
<p>
"To say it another way, our North American social structure 
involves a greater expenditure of energy per capita per day than 
any other social mechanism of the past or present.  There are no 
physical factors in existence which would prevent the efficient 
operation of this Continent on an energy basis.  The only thing 
that does prevent it is our devotion to a shibbolith -- PRICE; and 
it remains to be seen whether we shall pay for our devotion with 
our lives.
<p>
"A new system based upon a recognition and an understanding of our 
available energy must be devised.  That is the problem before the 
people.  It can be done.  Are we going to set about it before it 
is too late?"
