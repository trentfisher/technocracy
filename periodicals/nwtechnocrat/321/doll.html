<p>
Director John Carpenter, it must be said, has not been a 
consistent contributor of socially significant film fare.  His 
films, most notably the "Halloween" series, generally fall into 
the category of ho-hum sensationalist hype, capitalizing on 
murderers, witchcraft, and other banalities designed for little 
more than short-term diversion and box-office return.
<p>
In his most recent effort, "They Live," however, Carpenter seems 
to have, knowingly or unknowingly, risen above the mundane in his 
adaptation of a Ray Nelson short story, "Eight O'Clock in the 
Morning," to jiggle the sensitivities of the sleeping masses and 
to nudge at a few preciously held Price System icons in a manner 
that Technocrats should find refreshing and fraught with meaning.
<p>
As the story opens, we see down-and-out backpacker Nada, 
(portrayed by pro wrestler Roddy Piper), fresh out of his dried-up 
job in Denver, plodding into the outskirts of a smog-shrouded 
metropolis.  After the increasingly familiar scenario of rebuff at 
the unemployment office, Nada finds day labor at a construction 
site and befriends a black worker, Frank (Keith David), who, on a 
similar quest for sustenance, has had to leave his family behind 
in Detroit (this is starting to sound more familiar all the time).
<p>
As the work day draws to a close, Frank invites Nada to spread his 
bedroll at the local shanty town, which, naturally, is the only 
place the drifting day laborers have to call home.  Food, along 
with a blind preacher's dire admonitions of impending doom, is 
provided by a church across the street, and over dinner starry-
eyed Nada and his somewhat jaded acquaintance debate the virtues 
of the system that has brought them to such mean estate.  "I still 
believe in America," Nada remarks as he tries to catch a glimpse 
of the city through a miasma of smog.
<p>
Frank is unconvinced, as he talks about the wife and two kids 
back in Detroit whom he hasn't seen for six months.  "We gave the 
steel companies a break when they needed it.  You know what they 
gave themselves?  Raises.  The Golden Rule!" he snorts.  "He who 
has the gold is the rule.  Everyone's in it for himself and out to 
do you in at the same time."
<p>
But this is America.  Even the deprived denizens of this tin-and-
cardboard Utopia are not to be denied the benefits of modern 
technology as they gather around the communal television for the 
night's entertainment.  On this night, however, the viewers are 
irritated when their commercial for false fingernails "in seven 
looovely hues!" is interrupted by an irritating signal-jammer with 
a disturbing message.
<p>
"We are living in an artificially induced state of consciousness," 
the hacker intones.  "The poor and the underclassed are growing.  
Racial justice and human rights are nonexistent.  They have 
created a repressive society and we are their unwitting 
accomplices.  We have been lulled into a trance."
<p>
Nada is transfixed as the distorted image on the screen continues.  
"They have made us indifferent to ourselves and to each other.  We 
are focused only on our own gain."
<p>
As one of the crowd curses and reaches to turn off the T.V., the 
fading words of the speaker ring in Nada's ears.  "Their only hope 
for survival is to keep us asleep, keep us selfish, keep us 
sedated."
<p>
As Nada reflects on this, his attention is drawn to furtive 
comings and goings at the church across the street.  He enters the 
church to the strains of "Rock of Ages" to find, not an enraptured 
congregation, but a tape recorder churning out gospel music, a 
transmitter, and a much-harried group of men, one of them the 
hacker who has been interrupting the T.V. reception.  About the 
time Nada comes across several boxes of odd-looking sunglasses, 
the wail of sirens is heard, and the police descend upon the 
place. Nada manages to escape, grabbing a box of the sunglasses as 
he heads out the door.  The hacker is not so fortunate, as the 
minions of the law converge on him and the blind preacher and 
proceed to bludgeon them to death.  As a helicopter whirs 
overhead, a bulldozer, accompanied by shield-wielding riot police, 
decimates the commune.
<p>
Morning finds our hero once again stalking the streets, a pair of 
the sunglasses in hand.  Blinking into the rising sun, he puts 
them on.  And then the fun begins.
<p>
As he looks up at a billboard, the colorful computer ad is 
replaced by a stark black-and-white sign that reads "OBEY."  
Startled, he removes the glasses and the ad reappears.  Glasses 
on, the command is back.  He looks at another billboard with a 
swimsuit-clad model.  "MARRY AND REPRODUCE," it demands.
<p>
Bewildered, Nada stumbles up to a newsstand and, bespectacled, 
begins thumbing through a magazine.  Every page reads, "CONSUME."  
A look down the street.  Billboards shout "NO FREE THOUGHT."  
"BUY."  "NO IMAGINATION."  "STAY ASLEEP."  Nada spots a wad of 
money in the news vendor's hand.  Jefferson and Hamilton are 
replaced by sheets of paper bearing the epithet, "THIS IS YOUR 
GOD."
<p>
Then Nada catches a glimpse of a silver-haired, Brooks-Brothers 
type businessman at the newsstand.  "What's your problem?" the man 
snaps.  He turns to Nada, presenting instead of a human face, a 
leering, pop-eyed, skull-like apparition.  Nada backs away and 
enters a store where he spots another apparition on television, 
this one the President of the United States, exhorting the nation 
to "ACCEPT!"
<p>
As he turns away, wryly murmuring, "I shoulda known it'd be 
something like this," he collides with another skullface who 
haughtily pulls her mink around her and sniffs, "Excuuuse me."  
This is too much.  Nada gives voice to what he sees through the 
glasses.  Immediately the woman lifts her Rolex to her lips and 
whispers, "I've got one that can see!"  Alarmed, Nada looks around 
the store, and a dozen of the creatures are moving toward him, 
barking his description into their expensive watches-cum-
communicators.
<p>
As Nada heads out the door, he is corralled by two police officers 
(also creatures).  He overpowers them and takes off down the 
street.  As he runs, he glimpses a transmitting device installed 
atop a "WAIT-WALK" signal.  "SLEEP...SLEEP...SLEEP..." it soothes 
as it whirls.
<p>
Awake now, thanks to the sunglasses, Nada falls in with a band of 
renegade humans, among them the scientists who have discovered the 
truth.  And the truth is that Planet Earth is nothing more than 
another conquest of an intergallactic corporation, bent on 
controlling the universe through their own version of free 
enterprise.  And humans are nothing more than grist for their 
muiltidimensional corporate mill -- except, of course, for their 
human apologists who have sold the rest of their fellow race into 
bondage, for which they are amply rewarded by the aliens.  Says 
the human who tipped the police off to the goings-on at the church 
when confronted by a gun-wielding Nada, "Hey, what's the threat?  
Hell, we all sell out every day!"
<p>
After the enterprising aliens destroy the humans' underground 
control center (and most of the recalcitrant humans in the 
process), the rest of the film is devoted to Nada and Frank's 
search for the aliens' transmitter that blocks out the humans' 
true perception of their subliminal brainwashing.  By accident, 
the pair stumbles onto the aliens' subterranean city, and Nada 
singlehandedly succeeds in destroying the transmitter.  
Unfortunately, in true modern hero fashion, he also succeeds in 
getting destroyed himself, but not before the world has its eyes 
opened to the alien threat.
<p>
The disturbing thing about this crazy film is that, except for the 
alien conspiracy plot, it's not crazy at all.  Although the film 
hardly stands as an epic cinematic achievement, if we look beyond 
the shoot-em-up histrionics and brief frontal nudity that seem to 
have become a hallmark of any movie rated closer to the end of the 
alphabet than "G," Carpenter has succeeded in merging a fanciful 
plot of alien domination with an all-too-real scenario of a 
society in extremis.  In the aliens' earthly marketplace, wars are 
not only handy for dividing the masses and diverting attention 
from the real culprits, but good for business.  And pollution is 
not only good, but planned, as the aliens attempt to simulate the 
atmosphere of their home planet.
<p>
The dialogue could be straight out of the Price System Survival
Manual.  ``Keep us asleep.  Keep us selfish.  Keep us 
sedated.''  Keep us divided, in constant conflict with each other.
This, too, is good for business.
<p>
They're all there, all the wiles -- brainwashing, domination,
intimidation, duplicity, frivolity, in the face of deprivation -- all
manifestations of Price System manipulation that Technocracy has been
pointing out for over fifty years.
<p>
So, far in their attempts to educate the citizens of North America 
about the futility of continued fealty to Price System dictates, 
Technocrats have not been faced with automotons wielding billy 
clubs and blackjacks.  The conspiracy of silence initiated by the 
Hearst Corporation years ago has been marvelously effective in 
keeping the lid on.  And Price System devotees require no 
transmitting device to lull us into apathetic complacency.  
Advertising, media hype and the inculcation of greed have served 
exceedingly well to convince us of a deceptive freedom and 
prosperity, as we blithely rush to enslave ourselves to the 
culprit that has created the pollution, the waste, and the human 
degradation.
<p>
The sweep of events, however, is catching up, snapping its fingers 
in the faces of a growing number of North Americans who are 
beginning to wake up from the trance.  And Technocracy is there to 
help them deal with the realities.
<p>
"They Live."  Check it out.  There is, after all, no they, only 
us. To paraphrase, we have met aliens and we are they.
<p>
Sunglasses on, everyone?
