Technocracy's Continental Headquarters research staff, has 
condensed on the following pages a fairly long article by the late 
Howard Scott, Continental Director in Chief of Technocracy Inc. 
which appeared in <cite>Harpers</cite> magazine, January 1933.  The article is 
just as relevant today as it was then, so why didn't something 
come of it?  Actually, something did come of it, but not what one 
might logically expect.
<p>
No civilization has ever developed technology -- and abused it -- 
like North Americans.  No civilization has ever had a 
scientifically laid-out design of social operations proposed to 
them -- which they then ignored -- like North Americans.  No 
civilization has ever allowed their best chance for survival drift 
away like North Americans have.  Howard Scott laid it all out in 
black and white in that <cite>Harpers</cite> article.  What then happened?
<p>
As Scott pointed out in a 1933 radio address to the nation from 
the Hotel Pierre in New York City, no support for an intelligent 
social direction was likely to come from any of that tribe of 
axiologists who were at the helm of the nation.  He was correct -- 
more correct than one would have then suspected.  There has been a 
continual barrage of disinformation, a conspiracy of silence about 
Technocracy, and heavy involvement in war and the preparation for 
war, facilitating the debt creation that has preserved the 
obsolete Price System these last decades.
<p>
But time is running out, money cannot be generated fast enough to 
do the housekeeping chores of the system, and political and 
business minds are not trained in physical matters.  So, problems 
mount; problems that bring discomfort, unease and danger to the 
general public; the pressure for social change is building.
<p>
Nobody knows how much pressure is required to move society in a 
new direction, but, one thing is certain, a focus must be made 
available for any such movement.  People will move, and if that 
movement is not constructively directed, it becomes a mob; a mob 
movement is a guarantee for disaster.  The only alternative is the 
building of a focus for social movement, fueled by an educated 
consensus -- a consensus that a worthwhile objective is attainable 
-- Technocracy.
