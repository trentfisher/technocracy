... By now almost everyone is aware of the effects of the build-up 
of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), how it is accumulating in the earth's 
atmosphere, and that it will, as time goes by, cause increasing 
temperatures on the planet, with the resulting repercussions.  
Anyone with even a nodding acquaintance with the problem is also 
aware that the main culprit in this CO<sub>2</sub> build-up is the 
automobile. How many people, we might ask, are cognizant of how 
great a part automotive transportation really plays?  As of 1987, 
the total installed Prime Mover Power capacity of the United 
States was 33,263,000,000 horse-power.  Of this amount, 
31,488,000,000 was used for automotive transportation.  This means 
that factories, mines, railroads, merchant ships, farms, electric 
generating stations etc., use only 1,775,000,000 horse-power of 
the energy generated by prime movers, a very small percentage of 
all generated energy -- and the rest was generated by automobiles.
<p>
... In light of the above, one could be excused for thinking that 
the logical thing to drastically reduce the build-up of CO<sub>2</sub> would 
be to sharply reduce the use of automobiles, getting as close to 
zero as is practical.  But this creates a dilemma.  Cars are still 
heavily advertised, and their ownership is emphasized as a status 
symbol.  Aside from that, people are forced to use cars because of 
the nature of our society.  We have built our civilization around 
the automobile.  The distance between our homes, and work 
locations, recreational pursuits, shopping areas, etc. 
necessitates the use of an automobile, because, in so many 
instances, that is all there is.  Efficient mass transit systems 
were gutted years ago, and those that remain are insecure.  The 
Canadian Government recently made serious cut-backs in the 
national rail system, virtually eliminating the cross-country rail 
service, meanwhile paying lip-service to the need to reduce the 
emissions of carbon.  A shortage of cash (and where have we heard 
that before?) will probably result in the closure of the public 
transit system in Buffalo, New York.  Heavy lay-offs are 
contemplated, which will severely reduce the system, even if it is 
not closed down completely.  All of this is just another example 
of economic expediency taking preference over the well-being of 
this planet and all that live on it.
<p>
... Another side effect of the build-up of carbon dioxide has been 
discovered, that is its effect on plants.  Fakhri Bazzaz, a 
Harvard University biologist, has grown plants in enclosures rich 
in carbon dioxide and found that the plants grow faster but that 
their leaves may be less nutritious.  It is possible that the 
leafy vegetables eaten by humans may have their chemistry changed 
so much that they would become unpalatable.  The accelerated 
growth of plants will, no doubt, also mean the increased growth of 
weeds with all of the attendant problems.
<p>
... The problems mount while the prospects for our survival 
diminish, and we blindly follow the dictates of the Price 
System.  We cling to the belief that monetary concepts must be 
saved, even if it means the loss of all else.
<p>
... It is indeed a paradox that the last words said by the last 
two survivors on this earth may well be "HOW MUCH."
