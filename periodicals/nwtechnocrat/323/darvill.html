...The U.S. spends more than $350 billion a year on various 
educational programs.  In spite of this, 25% of school age 
children can neither read at a satisfactory level or write 
correctly.  Since 1985, every fourth student in high school has 
failed to earn a diploma and has dropped out of high school.  
Every year, 2 million Americans leave school without having 
learned to read and write.
<p>
...The Gulf War has again emphasized the uneven distribution of 
the world's energy resources, in this case oil and natural gas.  
The economic independence of the "advanced countries" is 
threatened, hence the bloodshed.  North America, which accounts 
for 28% of world energy consumption, has only about 4% of the 
world's oil reserves and about 7% of its natural gas reserves.  
Western Europe accounts for 17% of energy consumption with only 2% 
of the oil and only about 5% of the gas.

...Along the border between the U.S. and Mexico, on the Mexican 
side, there are 1,300 U.S. owned factories, producing everything 
from hospital gowns, saxophones, radar detectors, overhead garage 
door openers, chain saws, and so it goes on.  Some very 
recognizable names are involved: ITT, IBM, Rockwell United 
Technologies, Kodak, Memorex.  What is the attraction?  Wages, 
with a top rate of $7.50 per day and the state of the Mexican 
peso. In 1981, the exchange rate was 25 pesos to the dollar; now 
it is 2,500.  This makes locating in Mexico a very attractive 
proposition.  No wonder there is now a frenzy of activity to 
complete a free trade pact between the U.S.A. and Mexico.
<p>
...From figures quoted in The Washington Spectator, it appears 
that as of the end of 1990 the richest 1% of the population had an 
income after taxes that equaled the total income of the bottom 
40%. In actual numbers this means that 2.5 million Americans 
amassed the same income as did 100 million of America's poorest.  
From the same source, we learn that revolving credit went from 
$54.9 billion, outstanding in 1980, to $215.8 billion as of 
September 1990.  Car loans rose from $111.9 billion, outstanding 
in 1980, to $285.2 billion at the end of September 1990.  As the 
economy slows down, how much of this will become uncollectable and 
add to the already bleak outlook for so many of the nation's 
banks?
<p>
...According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), 2,268 cases 
of AIDS in children under 13 have already been reported in the 
U.S.  In addition CDC estimated, HIV infections will reach 20,000 
children this year.
<p>
...Wars, famines, malnourished children, educational and health 
problems, poverty, crime, financial problems, unemployment, 
pollution, the list of symptoms goes on.  The point is, that this 
is what they are, symptoms, all of them an indication of the 
inability of an obsolescent Price System to cope with a host of 
related problems largely of a technological nature. 
<p>
...We must face up to this fact, that they are merely symptoms, 
and the continued futility of trying to maintain this outmoded 
method of social operation will only result in those symptoms 
becoming more serious, resulting in more misery for all.  With the 
installation of a functional form of government, namely a 
Technate, those problems could be addressed and solutions found.
<p>
More next issue.
