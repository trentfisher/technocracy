<p>
For the welfare of this Continent, there had better be a greatly 
expanded distribution of the facts, and a clearly identified means 
to bring about an orderly transition from the Price System to 
Technocracy.
<p>
Individuals become Technocrats because they understand that if 
problems before this Continent are to be solved, they will have to 
do something about it themselves.  The type of individual who is 
able to be a Technocrat doesn't quit thinking about things because 
the Price System leadership is lousy.  This only serves to 
irritate them to take action.  They are willing to fight for this 
civilization because they think that it is worth saving.
<p>
The tendency of the human being is to keep trying to do things the 
way they were done in the past, despite the increasing difficulty 
that may be encountered.  North America, for that reason, has 
clung to the Price System when it should have been "scrapped" long 
ago.  North Americans are waiting for something to happen.  One 
quite often hears the remark from individuals interested in 
Technocracy: "When the time comes, I'll be there to support you."  
This is "bandwagon" behavior, and shows no understanding of the 
role of Technocracy Inc.  When the time comes for large scale 
action, the framework for the social movement for Technocracy had 
better be already built.  You don't prepare for an emergency after 
you get into it: you either prepare for it beforehand or take the 
consequences.
<p>
An investigation of Technocracy's blueprint will show that in all 
respects it has employed the scientific method in each specific 
problem as well as for the entire operation.  No other organization 
has done this in the past, and no other is doing so now.  
Technocracy stands alone in preparing this Continent and its 
people for the social change being thrust upon them by science and 
technology.  Whether or not Technocracy ever comes into existence, 
the same problem of conflict between physical abundance and a 
scarcity economy would be facing North Americans.
<p>
Technocrats have no more to gain from implementation of 
Technocracy than any other North American.  If some are placed in 
positions of functional responsibility it will be because they, 
like their fellow leadership personnel, have demonstrated the 
necessary competence.  They are promoting the blueprint not for 
their own gain but because the nature of the developing social 
crisis demands such a solution.
<p>
For several decades Technocracy Inc. has made the Technological 
Social Design available to government and the public for an 
examination of the facts that show what must be done to avoid 
social chaos.
<p>
Technocracy's Continental Headquarters is staffed by Technocrats 
who will provide information to anyone concerned enough to request 
it.  The objective is to inform enough people with those facts 
arrived at through the research that has been confirmed by the 
physical events of more than sixty years.  If the majority of 
citizens and government continue to ignore those facts, they do so 
at the peril of possible human extinction.  Technocracy does not 
ask for soap box oratory or aimless activism, only an honest 
examination of the factual material available.  It is apparent 
that most people think they are immune from the results of social 
decay.  But as the breakdown of the Price System proceeds, no one 
will remain unaffected, and those who think that money will save 
them from the horrors of chaos, in a system dependent upon the 
installed technology, have an awakening coming in the not too 
distant future with which they may not be able to cope.
