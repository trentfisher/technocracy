Thanksgiving weekend November, 1990 -- everyone was interested in 
the extra high winds and the condition of the flooding rivers of 
Western Washington.  But none were prepared for the alarming news 
being broadcast -- Old I90 floating bridge is going down!  One 
pontoon section started sinking, wrenching free from the adjoining 
sections and then -- down it went!  Other sections, now free of 
restraint, swung around, ripping and tearing the roadway that 
overlaid the pontoon sections until they, too, were free to sink 
or float away.  The process was broadcast on television despite 
the rain and wind which prevented a clear view of what resembled a 
domino effect -- one section after another, buffeted by wind and 
waves, breaking loose and adding to the catastrophe.  Tugs were 
brought to the scene to try to bring the loose sections under 
control and to try to prevent the adjoining floating bridge, newly 
finished, from the now unimpeded force of the storm.
<p>
It was quite a sight, a line of tugs, facing into the storm, 
fastened to the new bridge, trying their best to overcome the fury 
of the storm to save the new bridge while others were pushing 
loose sections of the old bridge against the shore of the lake.  
Anchors were devised in a hurry for the windward side of the new 
bridge, the side where the Old I90 bridge went down, and the new 
bridge survived.  But there were many hours of anxiety when a few 
more miles per hour of wind could have brought the new bridge down 
too.

<p>
When the wind went down, and before the tugs took the unsunk 
sections somewhere out of sight, a stroller along the shore could 
see a long section with access doors along the side completely 
open to the weather -- just inches above the water. (Picture 
above).  Some access doors were covered with steel doors which 
were dogged down, and some others had plywood covering the gaping 
holes.
<p>
One story about the cause of the catastrophe tells of demands by 
environmental people that the contractor doing work on the bridge 
not dump waste into the lake.  According to the story, the 
contractor hadn't figured on the expense of hiring barges, or 
whatever, and so just pumped his waste into a pontoon.  Another 
report was circulated that the first section to sink must have 
been leaking -- it was low in the water.
<p>
It goes without saying that there should have been persons in 
authority properly managing the situation, but obviously there was 
no competent person responsible -- or he would have been concerned 
and have done those things needed to insure the safety of the 
bridge.  The follow-up to this catastrophe now is to find someone 
to take blame.  But the problem is really the social system 
itself; it is an innappropriate mechanism for managing our 
technology.
<p>
Magazines, newspapers and television have spelled it out 
extensively: our infrastructure is coming apart.  The TV show 60 
Minutes had a very extensive portrayal of roads, bridges, water 
systems and other infrastructure in New York City that are 
antiquated and beyond repair.  Some of New York's infrastructure 
was ruined completely because of the lack of maintenence.  This 
was a very scary show, but it isn't unique; other cities have 
conditions as bad.  <cite>Operating Engineers</cite> magazine stated that it 
would take three trillion dollars and ten years just to bring our 
roads and bridges up to where they can be maintained.
<p>
People should be able to see the obvious -- the job just cannot be 
done -- not in a Price System.  With 377,000 bridges, 40% of which 
need repair or strengthening, and with the funding needed 
shrinking, we are taking unnecessary chances every time we cross 
a bridge.
