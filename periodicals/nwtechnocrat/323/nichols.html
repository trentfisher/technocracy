<p>
Society in this country and on this Continent has become entirely 
too complex and far too expensive to be operated by the dictates 
of an economic system based on the concepts and the working 
mechanism of a social system handed down from the dark-ages, 
however much it is patched and modified.
<p>
The political method of reaching conclusions on the basis of 
beliefs, opinions and superstitions is just not accurate enough 
for the administration of a high-energy, highly technological 
society such as that now existing on the North American Continent.  
In past centuries of slow-moving, slowly-changing, low-energy, 
human-powered social activities the politician was a natural
descendant of the strongman, the witch doctor and medicine man.  
They have all been antiquated by the rapidly expanding use of 
science and technology.  The difference is literally like stepping 
out of a two-horse wagon into a Boeing 747.  The methods of 
control are entirely different. The political techniques of the 
past no longer fit the conditions of the present.  And 32 million 
Americans living in poverty is proof that this is so.  The soaring 
debt structure, exploding health care costs, the S&L crisis, 
increasing crime, environmental degradation, and the deterioration 
of the Continent's infrastructure are all additional proof that 
the present politico-economic methods handed down from the past no 
longer have the ability to efficiently control and operate this 
high-energy society.
<p>
Politics and the political method have become irrelevant.  
Politics is a governmental operating mechanism based on existing 
beliefs and opinions which have had only minor changes since ages 
past.  Such methods have no place in a highly complex, highly 
technical society.  They are not solving this society's problems.  
Politicians don't know how to solve such problems and, 
unfortunately, there is little chance that they ever will.  So -- 
why shouldn't they be considered irrelevant?
<p>
Obviously everyone knows that something, somewhere along the line, 
must give.  Everyone knows that the debt can't be increased 
forever in increasing amounts if money is to have any value.  
Everyone knows some kind of change is inevitable.  But, 
paradoxically, everyone seems to think that it is unpatriotic to 
admit that the country and it's political referee is in trouble.  
This is the attitude which has put us on the brink of disaster, 
and it is the attitude which could very well make survival 
doubtful.  If we can't see, or if we refuse to see the trouble, to 
admit that it exists, we certainly can't fix it.  It is long past 
the time when we should have started a careful investigation of 
our problems in an attempt to understand their magnitude and the 
physical requirements for their correction.
<p>
While scientific investigation and the engineering abilities based 
on the factual knowledge that result from those investigations 
have built a technological mechanism on this Continent which is 
unparalleled in human history, a control technique based on 
superstitious nonsense about monetary values is still maintained 
to affect the distribution of the vast quantity of goods and 
services that result from the use of technology.  The result is 
millions of Americans living in poverty when plenty for all can 
easily be produced.  A few examples of social idiocy: Farmers are 
paid to produce less; millions of tons of goods are shipped abroad 
every year, but not for humanitarian reasons; the shoddy goods 
racket is wasting natural resources and polluting the environment; 
while the debt structure is increased by the millions every day to 
pay for it all.  What an insult to our intelligence!
<p>
Here we are after years of "good times" under George Bush, with a 
half trillion dollars down the drain for the S&L bailout, with 
banks following the same path, with financial difficulties in 
almost every school district, financial difficulties in the 
cities, in the counties, and in the states as well as the federal 
government itself.  Everywhere there are money troubles, the 
federal debt is 3.3 trillion and increasing at more than a 
trillion every four years.  Everyone is up to their ears in debt; 
consumers owe $737 billion; they can't afford higher taxes, and 
they certainly can't afford a half trillion S&L bailout or the 
cost of environmental cleanups.  Neither can they afford three to 
five trillion dollars to repair the nation's infrastructure, nor 
can they afford the $4,160 per capita interest payments on the 
nation's $13 trillion total debt.
<p>
<strong>32 million Americans are living in poverty, not because we can't 
produce enough, but because they don't have the money to buy what 
they need.</strong>
<p>
This is the financial condition in which the United States found 
itself in the year 1990.  And Canada is in a similar condition.  
What kind of recession can one expect with these conditions?  What 
can be expected when the increasing debt can no longer be 
maintained and a major recession can no longer be avoided?  North 
Americans are facing the biggest financial mess they have ever 
known.  And they are not being prepared for it by their political 
"leaders", the educational system or by the press.  North 
Americans are still depending for solutions to their economic woes 
on the same "leaders" who profit most from existing economic 
methods which are the cause of those economic woes in the first 
place.
<p>
All the goods and services North Americans need are available.  
Walk into any department store; the selection of merchandise is 
almost unlimited.  Look over the automobile dealers; whatever 
kind, size or color is on display.  Vast shopping malls are built 
throughout the country to expedite the sale of almost every type 
of commodity one could desire.  But the trouble is money.  North 
Americans could have plenty, because they have the natural 
resources and the technology to produce it.  What they don't have 
is the money to buy it.  Which means that the supply of money is 
too limited, and its distribution is too restricted for all 
citizens to have enough to buy the things they need; those 
restrictions exist because of the traditional values man has been 
taught to believe in.
<p>
All over the world, all during the dark-ages (from which man is 
yet to emerge) little children are taught to believe in the value 
of money.  They grow up to value it out of all proportion to its 
physical usefulness.  Man will work from dawn to dark for it, he 
will lie, cheat, steal, murder and fight wars for it.  And he will 
ruin the only environment his species can live in for it.  Money, 
and the theory of money as well as the system of trade and 
commerce based on it has been a failure.  This failure becomes 
more oppressive, more unreasonable, as our ability to produce 
increases.  The more difficult it becomes to maintain the scarcity 
required for a monetary system to operate the more it costs to 
maintain the system.  If anyone thinks Congress, or any other 
political body can balance the budget without bringing on a 
depression they should have second thoughts on the matter.
<p>
We must realize that in this technological age, in order to 
maintain this monetary system, man must act ever-more like a fool.  
He must pay farmers to produce less so he can pay more for what he 
eats; he must make shoddy goods so they will wear out in a hurry 
so he can buy more goods to make more jobs for people who need to 
work longer hours to make enough to pay for the cost of 
maintaining scarcity.  And the rich get richer and own the 
factories, the banks, S&Ls and insurance companies.  The poor get 
poorer, as they must borrow the money from the rich to pay for 
maintaining the scarcity required to operate the system which 
makes the rich richer.  And they must pay interest on the money 
they borrow from the rich which makes the rich still richer.
<p>
This system cannot operate without an increasing debt structure; 
and now the rapidly growing debt required for its operation is 
becoming too expensive to pay the interest payments.  Society on 
the North American Continent is about to reach an impasse in which 
it can't operate under the limitations required by its dark-age 
concepts.  In order to avoid the chaos likely to result from a 
collapse of an economic system based on debt, the citizens of this 
Continent must overcome the social restrictions imposed by the 
traditional "values" of the past.
<p>
Is all this to be wasted?  All the knowledge concerning that real 
physical world in which we actually live, all this useful 
knowledge supplied by the scientific method which has propelled 
mankind along a path toward the ability to greatly improve his 
life on this earth -- is all this progress to end, to be wasted, 
to result in an increasing number of North Americans living in 
poverty, with an increasing debt which requires an increasing 
sacrifice to pay the interest on a debt which can never be paid?
<p>
How long can North Americans be expected to tolerate the 
limitations of an economic system based on dark age superstitions 
concerning commodity valuation when they could be enjoying the 
fruits of a technologically produced abundance?  The answer is 
just so long as they can continue to be kept in ignorance 
concerning alternate choices, or until the present Price System 
can no longer be made to operate.
<p>
The U.S. and Canada have progressed about as far as the 
restrictions of a Price System will allow.  The burden of debt and 
its interest payments have become almost unbearable.  The 
infrastructure is obsolete, and the money for repairs is becoming 
ever more difficult to provide.  Everywhere one turns the money 
problems have become so oppressive that progress has come to a 
standstill.
<p>
North Americans, who have traditionally improved their living 
standards and secured their future by accumulating more money may 
soon find that to achieve their ends it will be necessary to 
install a far more efficient method of distribution which will 
require neither money or its substitute, debt.  In that event, 
they will also be solving the problems of their fellow North 
Americans.  No longer can individual economic problems be solved 
by individual efforts at chiseling the rest of society, or by 
individual greed.  In spite of our dark-age concepts, the 
technologically produced abundance requires the cooperative 
efforts of all citizens despite old antiquated opinions and 
beliefs that are not easily discarded.  However, whether or not 
these new concepts are acceptable to individual citizens, the 
nature of the job to be done makes cooperation necessary.

As it becomes ever more obvious to you that fundamental changes 
are necessary, please keep in mind that you may contact
