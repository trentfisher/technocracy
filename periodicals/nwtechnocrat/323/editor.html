<p>
A long look at human history, back down a long trail of evolution 
to the Earth's first ability to support life, gives one a more 
humble appreciation of our precarious situation here on this 
planet.  Much is yet to be learned, but scientists have already 
uncovered a picture that is quite clear.  It shows the 
interdependence of humans with the rest of the planet and the
relentless pursuit, following a course toward the destruction of the
very things mankind requires for survival. Man now deserves the
epithet -- a scourge upon the Earth, and it will be a difficult task
to reverse course and to achieve even a tenuous balance between our
activities and the demands of Nature.
<p>
Mankind has organized societies with mere refinements of the
tribalisms, nationalisms and brutishness of the past. But in a
parallel development, humans have ideas of fairness, of appreciation
of beauty and of order.  The scientific method is an extension of 
those ideas, and we usually find that the "rightness" of things is 
coincident with the laws of nature.  Ignorance is sometimes said 
to be bliss, but, instead, it is usually found that it is more 
satisfying to gain understanding.
<p>
Well then, what to do?  How can we humans arrest our headlong 
plunge toward disaster?  Is it possible?  Maybe.
<p>
As with any problem, to find a solution one must have a place to 
begin, a point of attack.  Sufficient facts are in, but now how 
to start?
<p>
Following World War II, the nations of the world met in San 
Francisco and drew up the specifications for the United Nations.  
At that time, Technocracy published an article, "The Vultures of 
the Peace", spelling out then that all that those nations had done 
was to have constructed a blueprint for more of the same old rape 
and pillage, and with provisions for only token efforts to stop 
it. War is profitable.  Next, when nuclear war began to be a 
worry, Technocracy spelled out what it would take to have a world 
police for the control of weapons of war.
<p>
But weapons of war are not all that the people living on this 
planet must deal with.  We must be concerned with our plundering 
of the Earth.  This is more than a popular cause; it is the 
survival of our own species that we must try to assure.  And, 
where to start -- the answer is right here with Canada and the 
United States.
<p>
Every economy in the world is a Price System, using money, a form 
of debt.  A Price System is limited to the distribution of 
scarcity, and often doesn't do very well at it. And its main 
characteristic is not cooperation between people, but, instead, 
mostly adversarial relationships. The one land area and population 
that has the best opportunity to shed the concepts of the past is 
North America.  We can have a society with cooperation as its 
hallmark.
<p>
Technocracy has always proposed an intelligent course of social 
action for North Americans, and now it is getting pretty late to 
begin trying to establish an intelligent stewardship of our planet 
-- Canadian and U.S. citizens had better "get with it" and 
Technocracy can show the way.
