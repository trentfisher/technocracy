In 1900, and again in 1915, the U.S. federal debt was $1.2 
billion. That debt has grown until, in 1991, it reached $3.5 
trillion, an increase of 2,916 times in 76 years.  In 1940, the 
taxpayers paid $1 billion in interest on the $42.9 billion debt at 
that time. That interest has grown until, in 1987, it was $240.9 
billion, an increase of over 240 times in 47 years.  The interest 
payments on the federal debt has become the treasury's 2nd largest 
expenditure.  However, as the chart shows, the growth of both the 
debt and the interest are growing at an ever faster pace.  Some 
may say that much of this increase is the result of inflation, and 
there is little doubt that some of it is.  The 1940 dollar is now 
worth about 10 cents, so inflation has increased about 10 times 
since 1940.  However, since most of the increase in debt (and 
interest) has occurred in the past 10 years, (see chart) 
inflation, then, could account for less than 10 percent of this 
increase.
<p>
[U.S Federal Debt Chart should go here]
<p>
Every segment of U.S. society is swamped with debt.  And the White 
House admits that this year's deficit will be over $300 billion.  
When all the ``Off Budget'' expenditures are added, the total may be 
well over $400 billion.  At this rate, the federal debt is now 
increasing by $1 trillion each 2 1/2 years.  Since 1960, taxpayers 
have paid about $15 trillion in interest alone to the owners of 
the debt.  The political leadership has run out of money; they 
have run out of ideas, and they seem more interested in saving an 
antiquated financial system than in rescuing U.S. citizens from 
economic disaster.  Canada is in a like condition.
<p>
Unfortunately, the federal debt is only part of this country's 
debt.  To the federal debt, add the debts of the states, counties, 
the municipalities, then add in all the corporate and private 
debts -- and the grand total that U.S. citizens, as taxpayers or 
as consumers, must pay is now about $14 trillion -- and increasing 
at more than $1 trillion per year.  The yearly interest on this 
total at 8 percent is $1.12 trillion.  To put it another way, the 
interest per capita, per year, is $4,480.  It is now necessary to 
borrow more just to pay the interest.
<p>
It is almost unbelievable that U.S. citizens haven't been kept 
informed of the magnitude, and the rate of growth of their debt, 
plus the obvious impossibility of its ever being paid.  This 
information is not secret from those who are willing to find it in 
any public library.  Try the Statistical Abstract of the U.S.; it 
shows the federal debt for each year.  Anyone can look for 
themselves to prove a point.
<p>
Since all efforts to reduce the expansion of the nation's debt 
have failed for the past half-century, one can only conclude that 
the job can't be done.  Therefore, all U.S. citizens should now be 
considering the results, and the implications, of their country's 
imminent repudiation of its debt structure.  Financially, both the 
United States and Canada are bankrupt.  The sooner this is 
admitted the more time will be available to prepare for this major 
crisis.  When the interest can't be paid without borrowing to make 
the payments, even a nation must see that its financial system is 
in a process of collapse.  That is what is now occurring in the 
United States.
<p>
The collapse has already started; the S&L bailout is one important 
indication, and the failure of more than 1,000 banks in the past 6 
years is another.  Other indications include the inability to 
finance the repairs of the nation's infrastructure, the financial 
difficulties of the states and cities, increasing crime, the 
shortage of money to build new jails, the lack of money for 
nuclear and environmental cleanups, less money to provide health 
care for the poor or to slow the increasing poverty rate.  These 
and more are examples proving that major changes in financial 
operations are unavoidable.  One should ask: Does one's patriotism 
require that these problems be ignored?  Is it one's duty to 
refuse to consider solutions?
<p>
How quick North Americans are in supporting a foreign war while 
being so slow in solving their own problems at home.  How quick 
they are to assume that the cause of poverty and hunger in foreign 
lands results from inefficient social operations, while at home 
poverty and hunger are assumed to be the result of laziness.  If, 
and when, North Americans become willing to start over, to rethink 
many of the things they thought they already knew, when they 
realize that these problems are not subject to political 
manipulation, when they become determined to get to the bottom of 
their own problems at home and are willing to accept only factual 
information (which has been available for more than a half 
century), they will then learn that any system, or method, that 
doesn't work should be replaced with one that will.  They will 
also learn that any system, or method, that has any chance of 
working in this highly technical society must be based on 
scientific knowledge.
<p>
In the study of the fundamentals of social operations, one will 
discover many things and will see them in an entirely new light.  
For example, one will realize that any government is, and was, 
created to enhance the welfare of the people who created it; 
otherwise, what was the point of its creation?
<p>
People must grasp a new reality:  Governments were not established 
for the purpose of adding to people's responsibilities, but to 
relieve them of responsibilities which could be better handled as 
a group.  PEOPLE WERE NOT CREATED TO SERVE GOVERNMENTS, 
GOVERNMENTS WERE CREATED TO SERVE PEOPLE.
<p>
Much the same must be said of an economic system.  It too was 
created by Man, not by nature.  The only reasonable excuse for its 
existence is to increase the efficiency of our monetary 
operations, and when it becomes an interference, its usefulness is 
over.
<p>
The world's present economic system was developed over many 
centuries of time; it probably was started before recorded history 
as a barter system.  It grew piecemeal as we added to it and 
refined it until today it has become highly complex, quite 
restrictive and inefficient as a social control technique.  And it 
now exists, with slight variations, all over the world.  This 
economic system was developed by man for his own benefit, and 
those who did most of the ``developing'' carved out as many 
advantages for themselves as possible.  So, the system is not 
designed to provide equal benefits for all.  One of the chief 
responsibilities of those who benefit most from the system is to 
censor any idea that an alternate system is possible.  As a result 
many North Americans are unaware of the approaching financial 
collapse or of the solution offered for this past half-century by 
Technocracy Inc.
<p>
As Technocracy has pointed out for many years, an economic system 
based on commodity valuation, can't operate if there is no 
scarcity, because commodity valuation is determined by the 
relative scarcity of commodities.  North America, with its modern 
technology, can eliminate scarcity; but since the 1930s the United 
States and Canada have maintained scarcity by artificial means:  
by the destruction of ``surplus'' farm products, by paying farmers 
to produce less, by producing merchandise designed to become 
obsolete, and by foreign gifts and wars.  By dodging the 
inevitable, the United States and Canada have, so far, been able 
to maintain an economic system based on price.
<p>
This Price System was designed in an age of scarcity, and scarcity 
must be maintained if it is to operate.  Theoretically, scarcity 
could be continued indefinitely, if the growth required never 
depleted the natural resource base, if the environment could heal 
itself at an ever faster pace, and if the costs didn't become 
prohibitive.  However, the costs have already resulted in a $14 
trillion debt that is growing faster each day -- and the interest 
rates continue to grow accordingly.  The Price System can no 
longer afford to maintain itself and is in a process of collapse.  
If we can't come up with a better design, we will go down with it.
<p>
Will North Americans willingly discard this Price System, the only 
economic system they have ever known?  Not likely, if they can help 
it!  It is quite probable that they will allow conditions to 
deteriorate until they become intolerable, until many more people 
can't afford to live and pay interest payments at the same time.
<p>
At that late date, will it be possible to salvage civilization on 
this Continent?  That can only be determined by future events; it 
could go either way depending on the intelligence that can be 
brought to bear on the problem.  The ``law'' of self-preservation is 
strong; it is possible that, when a do-or-die situation occurs, a 
widespread movement may be expected.  If the direction then taken 
is correct, there is a good chance.  That is, if the point of no 
return hasn't already been passed by that time.  In any case, the 
best chance for North American survival is a prompt investigation 
of Technocracy.
