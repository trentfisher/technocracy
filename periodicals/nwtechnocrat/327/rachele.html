This article was submitted by Technocracy member Sam 
Rachele as a letter to the editor, but was printed instead in the 
guest editorial column ``As I see it'' of the January 16th issue of 
the Gazette Times, Corvallis, OR, under the title
<cite>U.S. economy needs radical alteration.</cite>

<hr>
<p>
For the United States and Canada the long term prospects for 
economic recovery are not very good.  The Federal Reserve has 
taken steps to pull the U.S. economy out of recession.  Although 
the move may provide a temporary stimulus, in the long run, it 
will solve nothing.  We face insurmountable obstacles that old 
economic palliatives cannot correct.
<p>
One major obstacle is the need for continuous and increasing 
infusions of government money into the economy.  Left to business 
by itself, there is no way that enough purchasing power can be 
created to buy the goods produced by modern technology.  In the 
United States and Canada, machines are responsible for over 98 
percent of all goods manufactured.  Mines and farms are also 
highly mechanized.
<p>
The economy in 1929 faltered for lack of money and a glut of 
merchandise; now the problem is much worse.  Economic survival 
since that time can be attributed to deficit financing and the 
management of goods and labor to avoid surpluses.  Now, however, 
the debt creation mechanism is in danger of faltering.  More and 
more of our national income must go toward payment of the interest 
on the national debt.
<p>
One mechanism for dealing with potential surpluses was fulfilled 
by the military.  For years the military has helped to generate 
jobs in the civilian sectors while at the same time siphoning off 
potential surpluses of both goods and labor from the civilian 
arena.  Now, with the need for a large military commitment 
receding, and because of budget constraints, this assistance to 
the economy is on the wane.
<p>
A major obstacle to recovery is the limit to exponential growth.  
Within a system using advanced technologies, an expanding economy 
can provide necessary employment.  However, as new and better 
technologies develop, the faster factories and equipment must 
expand.  This phenomenon is a self-defeating proposition.  Since 
the number of man-hours in basic industries has been declining for 
many years, most new employment has been shifting to the service 
sectors.  However, the recent revolution in electronic equipment is 
now taking its toll on the white-collar work force.  The prospects 
for continuous economic growth, for the near future, are dim, and 
for the long run, apparently, impossible -- we live on a finite 
planet with finite resources, and with limits to environmental 
abuse.
<p>
Another development is the steady flow of products into American 
markets from other countries, especially Japan.  Recent plans by 
General Motors to close some of its plants is a reflection of the 
inferiority of American-made cars, the streamlining and automation 
of manufacturing and assembling, and the lack of purchasing power 
in a declining economy.  An important point is the fact that high 
quality has a negative impact on our economy by inhibiting the 
demand for new products.  Some innovations, model changes, style 
changes, making throw-away products (that is expedient 
obsolescence) in general are in large part surplus-control 
mechanisms.
<p>
The need for economic growth as a means for creating jobs has long 
been recognized.  The impact on the environment has long been 
minimized or ignored.  How ironic, that instead of encouraging 
people to consume less, the hue and cry in business and politics 
is to buy more and more.  President Bush's frenzy over public 
confidence and his urging people to get out and buy is sheer 
lunacy.  Usually the people with the greatest need are least able 
to buy.  Life-threatening environmental damage, due to unwise 
consumption and over-consumption, is becoming increasingly 
apparent.
<p>
In summary, our economy, for the past 60 years has flourished 
because of accelerating government and private debt, extravagant 
militarism, expedient obsolescence, and creation of demand by 
costly sales promotion schemes.
<p>
Even though the floodgates of debt will be opened, as a last 
resort by panicking politicians, the cost of debt will eventually 
choke the debt flow off.  At the same time new technologies will 
make faster economic growth more imperative, but increasingly 
difficult, due to a disparity between income and production.
<p>
We are very close to economic and social chaos in North America.  
Russia's problems will pale in comparison, since eastern Europe 
is more agrarian.  It may be that the only viable solution is the 
one advocated by Technocracy Inc.  Its proposed ``Scientific Social 
Design'' eliminates the use of money -- and debt in general, as a 
means of distribution; instead they advise the use of non-
negotiable energy units.  The design emphasizes function and sound 
ecological considerations.
<p>
The proposal is, indeed, radical, but theoretically workable.  
Since we have few options, we need to look at radical ideas.  The 
future looks grim.  For many this grim future has already begun.
