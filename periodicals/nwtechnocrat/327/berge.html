<p>
The world has reached a stage of technological development that, 
if conditions are to improve, requires a new type of social 
organization, one that is not based on Price System techniques.  A 
Price System requires that goods be scarce in order to preserve 
price.  Social systems the world over are Price Systems in various 
forms, and a Price System is by its nature wasteful and 
adversarial.  The world's needs could be better met, especially 
with the technologically advanced countries' affairs being based 
on cooperation.
<p>
The problem seems simple, especially between countries with 
similar cultures -- but it isn't; recent decades have shown that.  
Victor Hugo is given credit for having said that "More powerful 
than armies is an idea whose time has come."  This is true, but it 
seems that an attractive and correct idea can be better understood 
and then put to use by having a model that is easily visible.
<p>
That seems to be the difficulty; nowhere is there a society that 
operates as a Technocracy -- a government organized to implement 
the best understanding of nature's laws for the benefit of all the 
people.  There are requirements for such a type of social 
operation:  There should be a full range of natural resources, 
sufficient land area with a plentiful supply of fresh water, 
compatible climatic conditions, a sufficient level of 
technological development and a population containing people with 
sufficient education and skills to operate the technology.  All 
this must be orchestrated by a governance called Functional 
Control.  A little study will show that these requirements can be 
satisfied best by unifying the entire Continent of North America.
<p>
The world is in social turmoil, and nowhere is there any 
indication of a new social direction -- just more of the same.  
But North America can provide a model for the resolution of many 
of the world's seemingly intractable problems and provide help 
where needed and appreciated.  This can be accomplished without 
diminishing our domestic resources or antagonizing anyone.  It may 
seem paradoxical, but North Americans can help others best by 
living well themselves.
<p>
North Americans, burdened with debt and a sinking economy and 
beset with a multitude of social problems, still have the 
opportunity to unify their Continent into a social organism that 
will bring them over a threshold that people have been trying to 
surmount for centuries.
