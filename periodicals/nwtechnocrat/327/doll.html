<p>
``Peace at any price'' has long been the cry of desperate people, 
willing to strike any bargain to establish harmony.  The irony of 
this statement is that the concept of peace is not related to 
price; but the mechanism by which we may establish peace -- that 
is, the equitable distribution of resources within a geographical 
area -- is blocked by the very nature of the Price System.
<p>
Many well-intentioned and dedicated groups of individuals have 
been formed to address the admirable goal of establishing peace 
between peoples and nations.  Much media attention is given to 
the gatherings of the representatives of various nations who meet 
trying to resolve differences.  Courses in peaceful conflict 
resolution are being introduced into school curricula.
<p>
All such approaches seek political compromise and concession on 
the part of the participants in order to introduce conditions 
conducive to social harmony.  What these well-meaning individuals 
fail to realize is that peace, whether it be between groups or 
nations of people, is not attainable within the framework of a 
Price System.  A Price System is defined as any social system that 
employs a negotiable medium of exchange, or debt, to effect the 
distribution of goods and services.  It is the very mechanics of 
such a system that makes the establishment of peace impossible 
when Price System demands for profit are the primary consideration 
in human relationships.  There are a number of reasons for this.
<p>
For peace to exist in any societal structure, first and foremost 
the physical needs of the total population must be satisfied.  No 
amount of diplomacy or compromise between interests will override 
this basic fact.  If this condition is not met, there will be 
conflict between the members of that society; and if one nation is 
allowed to withhold resources from another for the purpose of 
enhancing trade values, there will be conflict between nations.
<p>
The Price System is incapable of providing for all on an equal 
basis, because the Price System works only under conditions of 
scarcity; goods and services must be withheld from a certain 
portion of the population in order that the value of commodities 
may be maintained.
<p>
There is profit in conflict.  An index of the welfare of a nation, 
the Gross National Product, is defined as the total monetary value 
of goods and services produced.  It is in the interest of the 
users of such a measuring tool to show a plus on the balance sheet.  
When the production of weapons, and the worldwide distribution of 
them, can enhance the GNP and provide jobs and income for many, it 
is not likely that such enterprise will be abandoned.  The same 
may be said for any number of anti-social activities that are 
engaged in to generate the cash flow that is the lifeblood of the 
Price System.
<p>
The heedless methods of Price System operation promote resource 
depletion.  It makes no difference whether the fate of the 
resources of a nation are in the control of government or of 
private individuals.  If the resources can generate a profit, they 
will be diverted from the use of the people.  The funds may be 
returned to a government bureaucracy or to privately owned 
corporations, but the resources are nonetheless gone.  And when 
resource shortages occur, prices go up, thus denying access to 
resources to an increasing number of people.
<p>
A good example of this may be seen in the plight of the farmers in 
Southeast Asia.  Rats are devouring their crops faster than they 
can harvest them, because local entrepreneurs have found a market 
for the skins of the snakes that eat the rats.  This results in 
monetary wealth for those selling the skins, but a curtailment in 
the quantities of real food available to the people.
<p>
The Price System is by nature contentious.  The game of financial 
exchange is a game of domination.  Each party ``cuts deals'' to his 
advantage.  When money represents the power to purchase necessary 
goods and services, control of money represents power over the 
lives of people.  The world of finance operates on the premise of 
competition for resource, which is in itself conflictive in 
nature. In a competitive society, a scarcity of goods is 
maintained to encourage competitiveness.  The adversarial nature 
and disharmony in such activity is obvious.
<p>
There will never be peace as long as an individual, or group of 
individuals, is allowed to withhold resources in order to maintain 
profit margins.  How can a nation that purports to strive for 
world peace destroy millions of tons of food in the interest of 
protecting profit margins?  Yet this goes on all over the world.  
Recent examples may be seen in the destroying of thousands of 
pounds of beef in Europe and the slaughtering of millions of sheep 
in New Zealand.  In the United States, government mandates call 
for the destruction of millions of tons of food annually, along 
with government incentives not to grow crops.
<p>
The Price System demands population growth.  By a steady increase 
in the number of customers the Price System goal of endless 
financial expansion can be better maintained.  Of course, 
customers must be wage earners, and here we reach a conundrum --   
technology replaces human labor and thus purchasing power.  The 
employment of machines is one method by which business preserves 
its profits.  Another is the exploitation of cheap foreign labor.  
Both practices generate animosity and hostility, both toward 
management and toward different cultures.
<p>
The glorification of warfare and strife is good business.  It 
sells and makes good press.  The recent commercialization of the 
conflict in the Persian Gulf, replete with all the regalia of a 
sporting event -- the tee-shirts, the jingoistic displays, the 
bumper stickers -- indicate the mindset of the general public and 
the tremendous manipulative power of the media.  War is glorified 
and glamorized.  The age-old concept of revering the protectors of 
territorial rights has been magnified into a justification for 
whatever military exercise a nation deems proper to further its 
mercantile interests.  Points of conflict have become national 
shrines, partly out of morbid curiosity, and partly due to 
misconceptions of the nobility of armed conflict.
<p>
It may be concluded that the current market system of distribution 
is no miracle cure for the distribution ills that generate social 
unrest.  Nor was it designed as a benificent deliverer of goods 
and services.  It was designed, instead, to return a profit to the 
holder of the goods in whatever manner necessary to achieve that 
end.  The most effective means of achieving that end is to limit 
supply to increase commodity value.
<p>
In order to establish conditions conducive to peace within and 
without political boundaries, the following steps must be taken:  
The current market, or Price System, with all its interference 
factors that subvert the distribution of plenty, must be abandoned 
in favor of an objective, scientifically designed system of 
production and distribution, based on energy values.  The 
contiguous land masses of the world must balance their populations 
with their resources.  An energy audit must be taken of each of 
these areas to determine the carrying capacity of the land.
Population levels must be maintained within the tolerances of 
the resources.  In spite of the protestations of those who favor 
market systems of distribution, the ratio of resources to 
population is a very real factor.  Technological advances have 
created a false perception that our inventiveness will allow us to 
thwart natural laws.  Unlike the erratic and flexible financial 
laws that dictate our actions, however, those laws are fixed and 
immutable, and every technological development not made in 
accordance with those laws shows up to our detriment sooner or 
later.
<p>
A technological management of the physical means of production 
must be installed.  This includes all natural resources and the 
machinery for developing those resources into forms suitable for 
human consumption.
<p>
Renewable energy sources must replace the use of non-renewable 
sources as the prime method of power generation.  One of the chief 
causes for world strife is the dependence of one area of the world 
upon the energy resources of another.  This allows one nation a 
point of leverage over the well-being of another, which lends 
itself to unharmonious relationships.  Here again, Price System 
methods must be abandoned, as such methods demand consumption of 
non-renewable resources to assure a constant monetary turnover.  
Once equipment is installed, solar rays, wind power and other 
alternate energy sources can do much to make any area energy-
independent.
<p>
Every North American citizen who is concerned about peace is 
encouraged to investigate Technocracy's program.  The following is 
a statement of Technocracy's position on war:
<p>
Only with a strong and viable domestic economy can the people  
of the North American Continent have a secure defense policy.
<p>
Technocracy is against participating in any war or foreign 
entanglement but upholds the defense and the security of North 
America.
<p>
Technocracy is unequivocally for taking all profits out of war; 
and that the youth of this Continent should never be sacrificed to 
protect financial and business interests.
<p>
In time of war or peace Technocracy has proposed and will 
continue to propose and advocate the mobilization of all of this 
Continent's resources to meet its domestic and internal 
responsibilities in which defense becomes a part of and not the 
dominant factor.
<p>
Technocracy proposes and supports the total mobilization of all 
resources -- men and women, machines, materiel and money with 
services from all and profits to none -- as the foremost 
transitional mechanism in time of war or peace.
<p>
Technocracy takes the position that if North America cannot put 
its own house in order, it cannot solve the problems of other 
nations of the world.
<p>
More than ever, North America needs a transformation to where it 
can apply its research and development, its science and technology, 
and its know-how and expertise, to mobilize its resources for 
meaningful and constructive pursuits.  Putting North America's 
house in order is our most important priority, not that of 
pursuing or perpetuating a policy based upon mass destruction and 
the ravenous depletion of the nation's and the world's remaining 
resources, a policy that sows the seeds for the demise of 
civilization.
<p>
There is no form of Price System, whether it be communism, 
socialism, capitalism, fascism, or any other ideology which 
affects distribution through commodity valuation, that can create 
the conditions necessary for peace.  The nations of North America 
serve no constructive purpose toward the establishment of world 
peace by exporting their own inefficient and inequitable 
distribution technique that is only able to distribute goods and 
services on a limited basis by the creation of more debt.  Nor 
will they serve the cause of peace by stationing their military 
personnel around the world in order to protect business interests.
<p>
The greatest contribution the North American Continent can make to 
the cause of world peace is to establish peace within its own 
environs through the scientific management of its resources, and 
through the distribution of the production of the Continent to all 
citizens as a right of citizenship.  By doing so, North America 
can set an example for the rest of the world.
<p>
World peace, or peace within given geographical areas, can only 
result from a carefully engineered design for meeting the physical 
needs of people on a equitable basis.  This requires the objective 
and impartial application of science and technology devoid of 
political, financial or ecclesiastical interference.
<p>
A comprehensive design for the North American Continent that meets 
the above criteria may be found in the handbook
<a href="../../../ttsd/">Technocracy, Technological Social Design</a>.
This design addresses every facet of 
the physical operation of a modern, high-energy civilization, for, 
as mentioned above, it is the physical we must first address if we 
desire to establish those conditions conducive to world peace.  
Time and time again, science and technology has been the prime 
mover in the elevation of the human condition, and there is no 
reason to believe that this will not continue, if science and 
technology are managed correctly.
<p>
Society stands at a crossroads. We can either cling to the 
outmoded pursuits of the Price System -- while witnessing 
dwindling resources and conflict between people and nations; or we 
can manage our resources on an objective basis, devoid of concepts 
of who deserves what -- and provide a secure future for all.
