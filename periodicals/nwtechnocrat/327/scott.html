In 1947, Howard Scott, founder and Director in Chief of 
Technocracy Inc., pointed out some of the factors that are 
involved in world events.  The following excerpt from the 
Technocracy pamphlet
<cite>Continentalism, the Mandate of Survival</cite> was 
pertinent in 1947 and is today.
<p>
Howard Scott pointed out that the U.S.S.R. was a contiguous 
continentalism, but was still operated by a Price System and was in 
a stage of technological development 50 years behind Canada and the 
United States.  He could not have known just how vulnerable the 
U.S.S.R. would prove to be when matching threat with a nuclear 
power that had demonstrated a willingness to engage in insane 
belligerence.
<p>
So, North America is now alone with its opportunity to form into a 
contiguous continentalism; it could then be a model for others.  
It can be done; indeed, we have no choice!
<p>
``World War I began on August 2, 1914.  The Triple Entente was at 
war with the Triple Alliance with one dissenting.  In March 1917 
the breakdown of internal operations brought into being the 
collapse of Czarist Russia and an accompanying political 
revolution.  The political revolution progressed through various 
stages until November 7, 1917 when the Bolshevik Revolution took 
over the control of the new Russian state born in the previous 
March.  Czarist Russia had ceased to be an ally of Great 
Britain and France, but the new Soviet Republic attempted to 
continue the war on the eastern front although it was finally 
compelled to throw in the sponge and sue for peace with Germany, 
which it finally obtained in the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in the 
spring of 1918.
<p>
``At the time that the Russians first attempted to negotiate an 
armistice and peace terms with the Germans in early December 1917, 
it ended in failure due to Trotsky disobeying his Government's 
instructions.  Great Britain and France were fully cognizant of 
the Russian attempt to get out of the war and to negotiate a peace 
with Germany.  British and French political leaders met in Paris 
and on December 23, 1917 they jointly subscribed to the document 
that has become known in history as the Anglo-French partition 
agreement.  It was entitled `L'Accord Francais-Anglais due 23 
Decembre, 1917, dinisant les zones d'action francaises et 
anglaises.'  Great Britain and France, the two countries that in 
1914 had agreed that Czarist Russia should obtain the Dardanelles 
as the price of her assistance in World War I, on this December 23 
agreed among themselves to divide up the territory of the upstart 
Bolshevik nation.  This partition agreement was but the first in a 
series of agreements, treaties, and alliances that finally led to 
the creation by 1923 of the Cordon Sanitaire around the western 
frontiers of Russia.  Invasions of Russian territory by her 
previous allies began in 1918.  Russia was invaded from Iran, from 
the Black Sea, from the Polish and Romanian frontier, from the 
Baltic and from the previous russian territory of Finland, from 
her Arctic ports of Murmansk and Archangel, from Vladivostok, 
Sakhalin and Manchuria.
<p>
<h3>CORDON SANITAIRE I</h3>
<p>
``Great Britain, France, Italy, Japan, and the United States were 
the first-class powers of the world that participated both in the 
military invasion of Russian territory and the creation of the 
Cordon Sanitaire.  The Finnish Soviet Republic was overthrown by 
the force of arms of the British armies under General Poole and 
the German armies under General Rudiger von der Goltz, accompanied 
by General Mannerheim.  Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, the Baltic 
Provinces of Russia, were taken by military force and erected into 
three separate Republics in the anti-Soviet Cordon Sanitaire.  
Poland, with western European military assistance, enlarged her 
territories by biting off large chunks of Ukrainian and 
Byelorussian territory.  Romania was permitted to incorporate the 
Russian province of Bessarabia.  Turkey, the former ally of 
Germany in World War I, an enemy of Great Britain, France and 
Russia, whose armies assisted the British under General Wavell in 
the invasion of the Russian Caucasus from Iran, was permitted to 
slice off the Russian provinces of Kars and Ardahan.  This was the 
crude beginning of Cordon Sanitaire No. I erected by the five 
leading powers of the world to contain Russia and stop bolshevism 
immediately after World War I.  By the 1930s Germany had become 
rehabilitated.  Germany under Hitler, Hungary under Horthy, and 
Italy under Mussolini became the chief blocks in the wall of the 
Cordon Sanitaire to be later joined by Spain and Portugal.
<p>
"It is obvious that by 1938 most of Europe had joined the Cordon 
Sanitaire.  It is also apparent that the creation of Cordon 
Sanitaire No. I may to some extent have achieved its purpose of 
having contained Soviet Russia behind its eastern frontier and 
blocked the spread of bolshevism, but it must also be noted that 
this Cordon Sanitaire provided the reactionary breeding ground in 
which the clerical fascism of Western Europe was spawned.  The 
propagation of fascism behind the walls of Cordon Sanitaire No. I 
was so efficacious that the fascist powers of Europe began World 
War II in 1939 with the concept expressly in mind that, when their 
armies achieved military victory, they would push the walls of 
their Cordon Sanitaire eastward beyond the Urals, and if this hope 
were realized, bolshevism and the Russian State would be forever 
defeated and isolated to an ineffectual territory between the 
Urals and Lake Baikal.  Let us recall again that Great Britain, 
France, Italy and Japan were first-class military and economic 
powers when they created Cordon Sanitaire No. I.  The creation of 
Cordon Sanitaire No. I was a geographical implementaion for 
placing fascism in control of Western Europe.  Cordon Sanitaire 
No. I backed by the leading powers of the world failed in its 
purpose.  It failed to contain Russia and it failed to stop 
communism for in the Europe of 1939, communism was the only 
social antidote to clerical fascism.  Cordon Sanitaire No. I has 
gone down in history.  So too has the fascist conspiracy of 
Western Europe of World War II.
<p>
``And now in 1947 after the carnage and devastation, the death and 
destruction of World War II, two voices [Churchill's and Truman's] 
loudly proclaim their demands for the creation of a Cordon 
Sanitaire No. II and a world-wide crusade to stop the communism 
that a Cordon Sanitaire No. I so utterly failed to stem.  Cordon 
Sanitaire No. I was in actuality a joint enterprise of the leading 
powers of the world outside of the U.S.S.R.  Cordon Sanitaire No. 
II will be the sole enterprise of the United States of America to 
be carried out with the spiritual benediction of the political 
Vatican State.  If the combined forces, political and military, of 
the prosperous going concerns of Great Britain, France, Italy, 
Japan and Germany were unable to sustain Cordon Sanitaire No. I, 
Technocracy asks can the United States of America contemplate 
even in its lush prosperity the wildest of all international 
gambles in history?
<p>
<h3>POVERTY AND POLITICS</h3>
<p>
``Military armies can stop and defeat the military armies of their 
enemies.  Political boundaries and custom barriers can prevent the 
flow of goods and travel of human beings.  But bayonets, machine 
guns and bombs combined with all the coercive police powers of a 
political state cannot stop ideas.  Ideas know no boundaries; they 
bow to no coercion.  The individual vehicle of an idea may die but 
the idea marches on.  Ideas germinate and flourish in social soil 
anywhere, and they become endemic to any territory whose social 
soil is similar in analysis to the soil in which they were first 
developed.  Fascism was used in Europe as an antidote for 
Bolshevist Communism.  Fascism failed primarily because it did not 
provide a new social design for the collective organization of 
mankind and the means whereby they live.  Fascism failed because 
it was in essence a national sadism for the perpetuation of 
privilege and the status quo.  Whenever and wherever hunger and 
poverty exist, where the privilege of the few insists upon 
maintaining itself at the expense of the common good and the 
general welfare of the majority, wherever economic insecurity is 
the only reward that the masses of any population can derive from 
an existence of human-toil and hand-tools, there will be found the 
fertile soil upon which the seeds of political communism can take 
root and thrive.
<p>
``Political communism can only be stopped by the promulgation of a 
more revolutionary social doctrine than that of Marx.  In this new 
foreign policy of President Truman, United States proposes to stop 
communism everywhere with a flood of United States dollars, goods 
and military equipment, and not a single idea that can even begin 
to compete in the socio-political sense with the political 
promises of Marxion Communism.  This proposed foreign policy is a 
world-wide preachment of hate against the doctrine of a political 
philosophy that didn't originate from the process of dollar 
success of American business.  The leaders in United States have 
fallen for a fundamental fallacy that, because the dollars are so 
important in the escutcheon of American financial nobility, the 
use of this primary motif elsewhere in the world will purchase 
immunity from social change for them in their sales territories 
both here at home and abroad.
<p>
<h3>FOREIGN POLICIES BEGIN AT HOME</h3>
<p>
``The foreign policy of a nation should be the external strategic 
implementation of that country's national policy.  The national 
policy of a nation is determined by the geography of its sovereign 
domain: its soil, climate and precipitation range within its 
boundaries; the adequacy of its natural resources; and the extent 
to which its continental area provides sufficient coastline on 
one or more oceans to provide the national entity with access to 
the seaways of the world.  Under this broad generalization, the 
second determinant of policy is the state of development of that 
nation's technology in the production and distribution of physical 
wealth to its citizens and, if necessary, to the world.  What we 
are herein describing is that there are two general categories of 
nations.  Of the first category there are those whose national 
domain are of such order of magnitude in size, resources and 
technology that it may develop into a contiguous continentalism.  
And there are those of the lower order of magnitude whose size, 
inadequacy of resources and technology place them in the category 
of dependent nations.
<p>
``The national policy of a nation in the first category can be 
entirely different from that of those in the second category.  A 
contiguous continentalism adequate in size, resources and climate 
to provide the means for a technological production and 
distribution of physical wealth can envisage its social destiny to 
where it may, under proper control of all internal operations, 
create an economy of abundance with a standard of livelihood 
impossible of attainment by those nations of a lower order of 
magnitude.  National policy would always be restricted by the 
geographical and geological limitations of the dependent nations' 
domains.  Nations in this second category can only have a 
national policy whose chief theme is the preservation of law and 
order for the legal distribution of scarcity within their own 
national boundaries.  Their policy must always remain one of 
conservative expediency and of small trickeries and minor 
pretences that arise from an insufficiency in size and the 
inadequacy of a minor order of national magnitude.  Their future 
is always one of national fear either of conquest or absorption on 
the part of larger and more powerful neighbors.  The psychology of 
their national policy is one of fear.  They are always on the 
defensive.  Their hopes of attainment in the world of 
international relationships are a perpetuation of more of the same 
national standards they have enjoyed.  They therefore are fearful 
of social change in other nations because, realizing their 
inadequacy on the international scene, they might succumb if 
national change were sufficiently widespread.
<p>
"The day of the small nation has passed insofar as no small nation 
today is capable of developing a social system that can be 
exported to the world superior to that which can be instituted by 
the technological application of science to the operation of a 
contiguous continentalism.  We of North America must realize that 
only a contiguous continentalism operated by a technological 
control can produce a national policy capable of having its 
reflex, its foreign policy as an exportable ideology of national 
welfare desired and hoped for by the people of the nations of the 
world.  The export of American dollars, British pounds sterling, 
or Russian rubles are but the peanut pretences of national 
incompetence on the international scene."
