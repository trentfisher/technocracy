<p>
We should ponder the statement of H.G. Wells: "civilization is a 
race between education and catastrophe."  It should be obvious 
now, and it is to many, that we are nearing the end of that race.  
Technocracy has informed millions of people of our social problem 
and its solution.  Whether Technocracy has succeeded or not, time 
will tell; Technocracy is not inevitable.  If luck favors North 
Americans, this effort will result in long term survival for the 
people in North America; but, if we do not pay heed, some other 
species, more favored by nature, will probably continue to inhabit 
the planet.  Man has no guarantee that he is a permanent species, 
and the same fate will likely be faced by the rest of the nations 
of this world.  In a large measure, the future survival of many of 
the people on this planet depends upon events here, on this 
Continent, and could be determined in the next few years.  North 
Americans have the potential for providing a model for others.
<p>
We shall have to find an answer to the problems that threaten our 
common survival that cannot be resolved and eliminated by the 
political process, by big or little business, by the judiciary, or 
by the various religious communities.  It should be easily seen 
that there is no institution within the framework of the present 
social structure, the Price System, that can provide the 
leadership and direction required.
<p>
Reading today's headlines, it stands out that editorials, 
economists, politicians, professors, think tanks, government 
spokesman and others, all have begun to focus on disintegrating 
nations, on violence, on corruption, poverty, growing joblessness, 
hunger, malnutrition, on sick eco-systems and other troubles, as 
though these societal malfunctions have just become realities, and 
as though they have never heard of Technocracy's warnings as far 
back as the 1930s.
<p>
How do our Price System institutions respond to the physical 
problems we face?  Politicians debate, orate, lay blame, pass 
countless laws, most of which no one pays any attention to, 
including themselves.  Corporations, harnessed to the goal of 
profit for stockholders, will only play their role as obligated by 
the Price System.  Economists are helpless in explaining events, 
having nothing to work with except obsolete concepts dealing with 
money.
<p>
To gain an understanding of the problems facing this civilization, 
we must be aware of concepts used in science and engineering, such 
as extraneous and non-extraneous energy, production and 
consumption, load factors, and other technological engineering 
measurements.
<p>
There is only one answer for us all.  Technocracy -- and that 
means science applied to the entire social structure.  There is no 
other way out of this mess.
