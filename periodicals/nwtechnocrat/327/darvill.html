... As the year 1992 commences, the economic outlook in North 
America is far from encouraging; deficits in both the United 
States and Canada continue to increase beyond the forecasts of the 
economic "experts", adding substantially to the overall debt of 
both countries.  As the productive capacity increases without any 
offsetting increase in consumption, the economic woes increase: 
unemployment mounts -- eroding the buying power of the economy, 
lowering the tax base, and further undermining the ability of the 
Price System to take care of the needs of the populace.  The 
number of U.S. citizens living below the poverty line has 
increased from 11% in 1975 to approximately 15% today.  New York 
City officials admit to a homeless population of 25,000, but this 
figure relates to people seeking shelter.  Those working with the 
homeless think it is closer to 90,000, of these 13,000 are 
mentally ill, and probably 30,000 are HIV-positive or are actual 
AIDS cases.  TB is once again becoming a scourge in New York; it 
has seen an alarming increase in the last ten years.  As the TB 
caseload grows, the funds available to fight this infection remain 
scarce.  New York City applied for $15 million from the Federal 
Government to fight TB last year and received $600,000.
<p>
... The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the federal agency 
that insures the pensions of some 40 million workers, is $2 
billion in the red.  Its liabilities affect all workers relying on 
a company pension to ease them through their retirement years.  If 
this was the extent of the liability, it would probably be 
manageable, but it is only the beginning.  When Pan American World 
Airways declared bankruptcy last year, its biggest debt was a 
$914 million gap in pension plans -- now to be assumed by the 
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp.  LTV Corp., now five years in 
bankruptcy court, has a shortfall of $3 billion in three LTV 
pension plans.  Chrysler Corp., with six retirement plans, holds 
less than two-thirds of the $8.7 billion they need to pay future 
benefits.  Bethlehem Steel's benefit plans are short by $1.3 
billion, and General Motors $7.2 billion.  In a robust and 
expanding economy this might not be a cause for alarm, aside from 
the ethical considerations, but, in the light of the present 
predicaments of major U.S. companies, it should be the cause of 
considerable concern for those people looking forward to a 
reasonably secure retirement.  Rest assured that the situation 
will not improve.
<p>
... In January of 1991, the Iraq war was started.  In this case, 
whatever the official reason, it was over access to oil; or as 
President Bush said, ``JOBS, JOBS, JOBS.''  The fighting in that 
particular battle has ended; and, at the moment, lip service is 
being paid to peace in that area.  However, a far more basic 
problem exists in the region,, one that is far more important than 
oil and, thence more potentially explosive, and that is water.  
The Israeli-occupied Golan Heights is the richest watershed in the 
area.  Under its steep slopes, underground springs emerge as a 
roaring river at Banyas.  From there the Dan River carries the 
water southward into the Jordan River, which flows into Israel's 
national irrigation system.  In all, the Golan yields 25% of 
Israel's water supply, a definite sticking point in any attempt to 
return the Golan to Syria.  Adding to Syria's woes, is the five 
year drought and the exploding population in Damascus that has 
sucked the Barada River nearly dry, creating a water crisis in the 
Syrian capital.  The Euphrates River provides about 60% of Syria's 
water supply.  But, up-river, Turkey has been building reservoirs, 
cutting the Euphrates' flow into Syria by about 50% over the past 
five years.  As with all other Price System problems, all of this 
is being allowed to ferment while the pretense of a peace 
conference sponsored by the ``big powers'' rambles on.  It will take 
more than political machinations to overcome the problems.  The 
technical problem of allocating the waters of the Middle East, can 
be solved, but sectarian zealots, over-population,and the hubris 
of know-nothing meddling by outsiders will probably prevent it.
<p>
... The problems continue to grow more serious and life 
threatening, and still we allow our attentions to be diverted in 
pointless and futile attempts to maintain an obsolescent monetary 
system that has not only outlived its usefulness, but is now 
threatening our very existence.  The problem is the control of 
technology, so that its benefits can be applied to everyone.  The 
longer we pursue this self defeating objective, the greater the 
turmoil we will eventually have to face.  Take a look at the 
alternative, Technocracy; it has the design concept to cope with 
the problems of a technological age.

More next issue.
