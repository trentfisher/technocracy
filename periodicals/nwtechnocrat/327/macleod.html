<p>
There is considerable evidence at present suggesting that we, 
cannot for too much longer, continue to do many of the things that 
we are now doing to the only environment in which we can live.  
The things we have done in the name of price and profit are 
rendering the air unfit to breathe, the water unfit to drink and 
the soil incapable of growing food that is edible.  When we reach 
that point, where do we go from there?  CO<sub>2</sub> buildup in the 
atmosphere, causing global warming, ozone depletion, the 
destruction of our tropical moist forests and temperate forests, 
technological unemployment, depletion of energy and mineral 
resources, population explosion, war and threat of war -- we could 
go on.  The list is long, but let's just go back and concentrate 
on a few of these points.
<p>
From the onset of the industrial revolution, excesses of carbon 
dioxide began entering the earth's atmosphere in quantities that 
began to upset a balance that had existed for goodness knows how 
long.  The CO<sub>2</sub> buildup became more than noticeable fifty or sixty 
years ago.  Some investigators started to ponder what the result 
might be in the forseeable future.  Now they are getting very 
concerned; the eight of the warmest years on record have occurred 
just in the last decade.
<p>
The ozone layer, as you probably know, acts as a filter that 
filters out harmful ultra-violet radiation and makes planet earth 
livable both to plants and animals.  One molecule of chlorine has 
the capacity to destroy on a ratio of 10,000 to one; 10,000 
molecules of ozone can be destroyed by one molecule of 
chlorofluorocarbon.  We are doing damage to our stratosphere, 
dissolving the ozone to the point now where there are huge gaps in 
that very necessary thin protective covering ten to fifteen miles 
up. The incidence of skin cancer is being recorded in numbers that 
far exceed anything that has been the case in previous history.  
It used to be a condition that was noticed primarily in people who 
had spent their entire lives in the outdoors unprotected from the 
sun.  Now they're finding more and more people, even young people 
in their twenties, children in their teens and even younger who 
are developing problems from undesirable ultra-violet radiation.
<p>
Tropical moist forests are disappearing in Brazil, Amazon, Borneo 
and all the way around the world.  Often these forest areas are 
cleared to try to conduct some sort of agriculture, but the 
fertility of the soil is poor.  Trees fall, and decay occurs; then 
new trees are recycled from old in a short cycle.  The soil itself 
has little fertility, but it gets a boost with the burning of the 
forest, because the ash is good fertilizer for only one or perhaps 
two crops.  Then a process of depletion occurs.  Without the tree 
cover, rainfall patterns change, erosion occurs, and what little 
fertility there is soon washes away into the rivers -- an 
irreversible devastation.
<p>
Looking at our own temperate forests, we see logging that far 
exceeds the rate at which trees grow.  Of all the logging that has 
taken place since British Columbia was first inhabited, fifty percent 
occurred in the last nineteen years.
<p>
<h3>TECHNOLOGICAL UNEMPLOYMENT</h3>
<p>
Slowly at first with the onset of the industrial revolution,  we 
found more and more ways of harnessing extraneous energy to the 
process of doing work.  We have harnessed coal and petroleum, 
natural gas, the power of falling water.  We have harnessed the 
chemical fuel cell, the atomic nucleus, the internal combustion 
engine and the hydro turbine.  We have, for the most part, brought 
about the retirement of the old methods of hand-tools and muscle-
power.  With hand-tools and muscle-power, nothing more than a 
scarcity could ever be produced.  It was only when new methods and 
technological advance made it possible to produce more and to 
consume more that we used more energy that required less human 
muscle-power and human attention.  We have recently progressed to 
the point where many of our productive processes are completely 
automated.  The raw materials go in one end and the finished 
product comes out the other -- untouched by human hands.  
Technocracy has now been on the scene for close to sixty years; it 
pointed out then that this trend was destined to continue.  This 
Continent has been capable of producing more than enough of 
everything for everybody.
<p>
In the 1920s, before Technocracy Inc., a group of scientists, 
engineers, mathematicians, statisticians, foresters, medical 
practitioners and others set about to study scientifically the 
method by which our society operates, and they found that <strong>the more 
we produce, the less we can consume!</strong>  This is because we live 
under the dictates of what we will call a Price System -- a Price 
System being any social system whatsoever that brings about the 
distribution of goods and services by employing some means of 
commodity valuation and employing some form of money or debt 
tokens.   A Price System has validity only under conditions of 
scarcity -- whether that scarcity is real or contrived makes 
little difference.  At the present time we find all manner of 
restrictions set up primarily to curtail the amount of production 
that is allowed, so that we can maintain an artificial scarcity 
and maintain price and value.  Undoubtedly, all have heard of eggs 
being dumped, flocks of chickens and turkeys being slaughtered, 
herds of cattle or hogs being slaughtered -- this in order to 
maintain scarcity.  Canada and the United States, for instance, 
are growing more wheat, corn and soya beans than they have ever 
grown at any time in the past, and yet we are paying more for a 
loaf of bread at the present time than we have ever paid at any 
time.  At the same time, we have more millions of people who are 
absolutely homeless here in the richest continental area on the 
globe.  We have people who are lacking for health care, shelter, 
education, food, transportation, communications and recreational 
pursuits, because they cannot pay.  At the same time, the 
political governments are going around telling the rest of the 
world how they should manage their affairs.
<p>
It might be useful to note that the United States has never come 
away from a war-time economy since the onset of the second World 
War.  They have spent more on defense and the manufacture of 
munitions, the hardware for war, for their own use or for sale to 
anybody who has the money.  Worldwide, the production and sale of 
armaments exceeds one trillion dollars annually.  And of that 
trillion dollars, the United States has the largest share.  In 
operating this business we are squandering the resource heritage 
of this land area and also that of other land areas.  Meanwhile, 
we are rapidly running out of the essential ingredients to 
continue to operate a high-energy technological society, the kind 
of society  we live in.
<p>
Little of what is done can be attributed to human muscle-power and 
hand-tools.  Not much more than one-percent of the total energy 
expended is attributable to the human engine.  More than ninety-
eight percent of the total energy that we convert annually is from 
petroleum, coal, natural gas and electricity.  So, in effect, we 
do not work for what we get.  True we go through some ridiculous 
excercises in futility in order to qualify for a paycheck, but 
none of us are ``earning'' a living in the old sense of ``earning'' a 
living.
<p>
We are allowing our population to expand at an exponential rate.  
It took all previous time up to approximately the year 1800 for 
the world's population to first reach and then exceed one billion 
human beings alive at one time on planet earth.  It took 125 years 
to go from one billion to two billion, and then it took not much 
more than thirty years to go from two billion to three billion; 
then seventeen or twenty years to go from three to four billion; 
and about fifteen years to go from four to five billion.  Now, we 
are rapidly approaching six billion human beings alive on planet 
earth at the same time.  We ask:  Where are the resources to come 
from to sustain that sort of human onslaught, remembering that 
standard of living and quality of life go far beyond just food, 
clothing and shelter?
<p>
A long time ago Technocracy stated that with the resources this 
continental area possessed, it would have been possible to 
elevate the standard of living and quality of life many times 
above what we now consider to be the average standard of living -- 
and for everyone.  It was pointed out that if you have the land 
area, the fresh water, the arable land, the energy resources, the 
mineral resources and the already technologically trained 
personnel that are operating that equipment, you can  devise a new 
system of social administration that circumvents the need for 
price and profit.
<p>
If we have the wherewithall, why destroy food, why require the 
taxpayer to pay the farmer for his wheat and then ask the taxpayer 
to pay for the transportation from where the wheat is grown to the 
nearest seaport to ship it somewhere else at a fraction of the 
domestic price?  We, even in our humanitarian efforts to prevent 
starvation or to ease starvation elsewhere, give away resources 
mainly so that we can maintain a comfortable scarcity -- a 
scarcity that can then be sold at the highest price.
<p>
Technocracy states that it is necessary to completely abolish 
politics and do away with a monetary method of distribution.  
Technocracy also points out that nothing takes place without 
energy being converted from one form to another.  Without energy 
you cease to exist, and energy in all its forms is measurable and 
doesn't change.  A kilowatt hour is a specific quantity.  So, here 
is the opportunity to construct a social design based on the 
common denominator -- energy. Here is a social design that would 
automatically eliminate the economic requirement for adversarial 
relationships and, instead, employ cooperation as its hallmark -- 
in keeping with natural, human relationships.
<p>
Citizens of the North American Continent are the ones who must 
execute the tactics which will support a strategy for survival.  
The Price System does not have any strategy for survival.  
Technological development has given social change a momentum that 
it never had before.  This generation must face the problem and 
find the answer, and there is not that much time left.  
<p>
Technocracy has always pointed out that Technocracy's method of 
social operation will not be adopted because it is desirable but 
because it is necssary; the choice is literally Technocracy or 
chaos.  Science applied to the social order is the only effective 
method of correcting our dangerous course.  Technocracy is non-
business and non-political; it is strictly scientific.  It alone 
can meet the requirements, and the process may be painful.  You 
have no security in the Price System; the only future worthwhile 
is a future in a Technocracy.
