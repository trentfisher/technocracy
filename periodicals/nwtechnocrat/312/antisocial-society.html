<hr>
<p>
The system of social control developed in the United States is
held up to the rest of the world as the ultimate. Let us look a
little more closely at this utopia the world is urged to
emulate.
<p>
Only 1% of the population controls 34% of the wealth.<sup>1</sup> The
Wall St. Journal estimates that there are over 500,000 homeless
people. The U.S. navy spends an extra $365 million above normal
operating costs per year to protect oil tankers in the Persian
Gulf. This is about three times that spent on energy
conservation.<sup>2</sup>
<p>
Not so long ago, all out nuclear war was the only thing that
threatened our total destruction. Now our price system has
invented many new ways. Destruction of the Earths ozone layer and
the pumping of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere now threaten
us.
<p>
The ozone layer, high in the earth's stratosphere, protects all
life from the sun's ultraviolet rays. It has been discovered that
chlorofluorocarbon chemicals, mostly used in refrigerants, are
destroying this vital sheild. Carbon dioxide is probably the most
important greenhouse gas. A greenhouse gas, of which there are
several, is involved in the trapping of the infrared rays leaving
the earth's surface radiating heat back into space. Precise
control of the balance of these gases is important to maintaining
the earth at the proper temperature. Burning large amounts of
hydrocarbons (oil, coal, etc.) is upsetting the balance of these
gases in our atmosphere. We are now conducting the largest
experiment in all of human history and if it turns out wrong life
on earth as we know it could be extinguished. In this deadly
game, the only thing of concern to our price system is the
beloved financial bottom line!
<p>
In many of our popular magazines and on the book shelves across
the country, stress management is one of the most popular topics.
It seems that we are having a difficult time living in such a
grand place.
<p>
Quoting: ``We express our longing for the ineffable in the
wolfishness of our appetite. Maybe the weight of our acquisitions
will prevent us from drifting off into the void, or relieve us of
our anxiety, or buoy us up against our fear of losing definition
in the world. The feasts of consumption thus become rituals of
communion.
<p>
Perceived as sacraments, the acts of consumption acquire a
spititual meaning not always apparent to a European, a moralist
or a bookkeeper. Taken in appropriate quantity and with a decent
regard for ruinous expense, products bestow health, long life,
status, sexual prowess, intelligence, national security,
happiness and peace of mind - all the bessings that devout
Christians expect from the hand of God.
<p>
If the state of perpetual dissatisfaction becomes imbued with the
significance of both patriotic duty and religious quest, then the
satisfied man stands condemned as a heretic and a traitor. To
admit being satisfied is to confess a crime against the state and
to risk alliance with the Evil One - that is, with anybody who
knows, or has, what he wants.'' <sup>3</sup>
<p>
Where would could such a quote be found? Might it have come from
the pages of Pravda or some left wing publication? No indeed, it
came from the pages of the Wall St. Journal and who should know
better!
<p>
<h3>Narcissism</h3>
<p>
The U.S. is probably one of the most narcissistic societies in
the world. `` Narcissism is a mental state where a persons' only
concern is with themselves. It is a state of experience in which
only his body, his feelings, his thoughts, his property, and
everything pertaining to him are sensed as being fully real.
Things not sensed as part of him are not interesting to him......
A narcissistic person finds objective judgement of any situation
very difficult.'' <sup>4</sup>
<p>
This trait shows itself in the strong interest shown by our
society in gambling. People are hoping to gain security for
themselves and let the rest of society go its merry way. It's an
understandable desire.
<p>
This trait shows itself again with our preoccupation with
religion, the quest for personal salvation. Technocracy can have
no quarrel with anyone who wishes to lift his own spirit and that
of others by religious means. But, much of what we see today is a
grasping for personal advantage over others, much the same as
with money.
<p>
We still have some survivalists and those of a similar bent
around. Such can be referred to as the ``crawl into a hole and
pull it in after you crowd.''
<p>
Ten percent of the U.S. population takes drugs on a regular
basis.<sup>5</sup> Evidently a large number of people want to be here
without being here. This is probably the ultimate in escapism,
short of suicide.
<p>
To the narcissistic patriot, the smallest imagined slur becomes
an instant call to arms. Patriotism, the decent response to the
needs of ones' country, in the hand of the narcissistic person
becomes a vengeful witch hunt.
<p>
<h3>Competition</h3>
<p>
We have developed a highly competitive society. Almost no one
today questions whether a society organized on this basis makes
any real sense. The human race owes its existence to the fact
that it is capable of cooperation between individuals. The human
race owes its existence to the fact that it is capable of
cooperation between individuals. The question is: Do we perform
better when we compete with each other or when we work together
or alone? This is a fair question. The answer is that cooperation
is far superior whether it is examined in controlled experiments
or by looking at competitive versus cooperative societies.
<p>
The Japanese have a far less competitive, much more cooperative
society than do we. The current balance of trade between the U.S.
and Japan is so lopsided that it is a source of embarrassment to
the Japanese.  W. Edwards Deming, ostracized in the U.S., took
his management techniques to Japan where they were accepted.<sup>6</sup>
His management system involves cooperation between management and
labor and is one of the ``secrets'' of Japans high productivity.
<p>
Our entire educational system is based on competition between
students. Yet it has been found that rearranging the process so
that there are no winners or losers produces far better results.
<p>
Our society is in love with whatever is number one.  This is one
of the major defects of our system. The skills required to be
number one and the skills required for competence are different.
Does competition build character as is so often claimed? A pep
talk (not uncommon) from the book <cite>That Championship Season</cite>:
``That trophy is the truth, the only truth.  I told him to get
mean, punish some people, put some fear into them, you have to
hate to win, it takes hate to win. I didn't tell him to break
anybody's ribs ....I just told him there's no such thing as
second place.''<sup>7</sup> What kind of character does competition
build?
<p>
<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>
Technocracy's argument is not that the current system is evil
(although it may very well be) but that if we continue to apply
science, technology, and energy to the productive processes we
will force a social change no matter what anyone wants. It is the
direction and form of that social change that Technocracy
addresses. The application of technology will force the collapse
of the Price System and all the social and cultural forms that
surround it. Society will have to operate on a non - price
basis.
<p>
The two major motivations for human behavior are incentive and
initiative. Incentive is that motivation that is external to the
individual, in other words, you do something because someone else
wants you to. (If you don't work, you don't eat.) Initiative is
that motivation that comes from within yourself. You do it
because it's important to you. Our society currently operates
almost exclusively on incentive - so much so that it is hard to
imagine any other way. It will be necessary to develop a society
based on initiative on a non - price basis that is without any
money in the society.  Such a society can only operate
cooperatively.
<p>
Most of the activity in our society today stems from the need to
maintain a scarcity artificially where none really exists.
Quoting from the book <cite>No Contest</cite>: ``When economists talk about
scarcity they generally are not using the word to mean that goods
are in short supply. Their technical use of the term refers
instead to (1) the fact that choosing one commodity involves
giving up the chance to have another, or (2) the presumed failure
of people to be satisfied regardless of how much they have. Let
us take these in turn.
<p>
The first usage defines a scarce good as one for which a consumer
would give up something else. Scarcity, then, concerns the
mutually exclusive relationship between commodities. This may be
a useful way of looking at the world in some respects, but it
tells us nothing about the absolute status of a given commodity.
The model is set up so all finite goods will always be considered
``scarce''; the availability of each is being evaluated vis-a-vis
the others. By definition, no economic system can remedy this
state of affairs, so competition is no more sensible a way to
deal with scarcity than any other arrangement.
<p>
The second definition rests economic theory on a very
questionable (but very rarely questioned) assumption about ``human
nature'' - namely, the belief that we will always want more of
something than we had before or more than the next person has.
Far more reasonable is the proposition that insatiability and
competitiveness reflect cultural mores. As Wachtel saw, ``Our
obsession with growth is the expression of neither inexorable
laws of human nature nor inexorable laws of economics......It is
a cultural and psychological phenomenon, reflecting our present
way of organizing and giving meaning to our lives...that is now
maladaptive.''
<p>
This position defines scarcity as a matter of psychological state
(perception or desire) rather than objective fact. Some social
critics have gone along with this approach but have shown that
this state, which is often used to justify competition, actually
is a product of competition. Specifically, it is argued, our
system manufactures scarcity. Our price system's driving force is
the quest for profits; its alleged success at satisfying human
needs is merely a fortuitous by-product. This goal requires the
continuous - indeed, constantly expanding - consumption of goods,
and these goods will be purchased only if they are desired. The
advertising industry exists to create this desire, to produce a
continual dissatisfaction with what we currently have and to tell
us of the fulfillment that purchasing yet another product will
bring. We must be ``educated'' as to the desirability of
low-calorie TV dinners, cordless telephones, and this year's
model of video recorder.''<sup>8</sup>
<p>
One wonders that if all advertising of food products were removed
from our mass media of communication would we all starve?  Why is
it necessary to advertise food!
<p>
``Sociologist Philip Slater is worth quoting at length: Scarcity
is spurious....It now exists only for the purpose of maintaining
the system that depends on it, and its artificiality becomes more
palpable each day....Inequality, originally a consequence of
scarcity is now a means of creating artificial scarcities. For in
the old culture (the dominant disposition of American life), as
we have seen, the manufacture of scarcity is the principal
activity. Hostile comments of old-culture adherents toward
new-culture forms (``people won't want to work if they can get
things for nothing,'' ``people won't want to get married if they
can get it for free'') often reveal this preoccupation. Scarcity,
the presumably undesired but unavoidable foundation of for the
whole old-culture edifice, has now become its most treasured and
sacred value, and to maintain this value in the midst of plenty
it has been necessary to establish invidiousness as the foremost
criterion of worth.  Old-culture Americans ....find it difficult
to enjoy anything they themselves have unless they can be sure
that there are people to whom this pleasure is denied .....Since
the society rests on scarcity assumptions, involvement in it has
always meant competitive involvement.''<sup>9</sup>
<p>
<h3>Behavioral Modification</h3>
<p>
The argument is frequently made that ``you can't change human
nature, that greed will always be with us.''  Technocracy has
never advocated any change in human nature. But much evidence
indicates that such behavior is only a cultural affectation and
definitely not part of human nature. The tremendous power of a
change in social environment to shape the behavior and thought of
the human being was powerfully demonstrated by Philip Zimbardo at
Stanford University.
<p>
His experiment was on the effects of imprisonment. Twenty one
male college students were chosen to take the roles of guards and
inmates in a very realistic prison that had been constructed in
the basement of the psychology building. ``The 21 subjects were
selected from a group of 75 volunteers precisely on the basis of
their normality: they were stable and scored in the middle range
of a personality profile. Equally important, they were randomly
assigned to the role of prisoner or guard. Almost immediately,
the subjects began to take on the pathological characteristics of
their respective roles. The guards delighted in devising
arbitrary tasks and absurd rules for the inmates, demanding
absolute obedience and forcing them to humiliate each other. The
prisoners became passive and obedient, taking their frustration
out on each other and otherwise assuming the role of victim. As
the guards became more abusive, the prisoners became more
helpless and dependent.  The patterns became so pronounced that
Zimbardo grew alarmed and ended what was to have been a two-week
experiment after only six days.
<p>
Given the design of this experiment, what happened can not be
explained in terms of the individuals involved. The researchers,
like the subjects, had been inclined to ``focus on personality
traits as internal dispositions for individuals to respond in
particular ways,'' thus ``underestimating the subtle power of
situational forces to control and reshape their behavior.'' Most
of us make the same error, Zimbardo contends, leading us to try
to solve problems by ``changing the people, by motivating them,
isolating them.....and so on.'' In fact, he concludes, ``to change
human behavior we must discover the institutional supports which
maintain the existing undesirable behavior and then design
programs to alter these environments.''<sup>10</sup>
<p>
The contention that people won't work for nothing is correct but
that something need not be money. The desire to be a part of
society is powerful part of the human make-up. In 1985 the Gallup
poll found that 89 million Americans work voluntarily in various
organizations - 44.5% of our workforce.<sup>11</sup> The only possible
reason for this is that they understand the need, and importance,
of what they are doing.
<p>
<h3>Leadership</h3>
<p>
The selection of leadership for the society was the next focus of
Technocracy's examination. It is obvious that if all of our
current economic institutions are to disappear, the culture and
rationale for our whole current civilization will disappear with
it.
<p>
The current society selects its leaders in the same dreary cycle
no matter where one looks. We elect them, then realize they don't
have any better answers than the last one. We then develop all
kinds of enthusiasm for the next person only to repeat the same
story.
<p>
Technocracy's proposal was really quite simple. Virtually all the
functions of the current political governments become unnecessary
once a price system no longer exists. This means that the only
real portion of the social system left that requires organization
is the physical means by which we live - the plants and equipment
that produce and maintain our standard of living and without
which we would all die.
<p>
What are the requirements for leadership in our present society?
As I said previously, the skills involved in being number one and
the skills involved in being competent are different.  Quoting
Eric Fromm: ``Among political leaders a high degree of narcissism
is very frequent; it may be considered an occupational illness -
or asset - especially among those who owe their power to their
influence over mass audiences. If the leader is convinced of his
extraordinary gifts and of his mission, it will be easier to
convince the large audiences who are attracted by men who appear
to be so absolutely certain. But the narcissistic leader does not
use his narcissistic charisma only as a means for political
success; he needs success and applause for the sake of his own
mental equilibrium. The idea of his greatness and infallibility
is essentially based on his narcissistic grandiosity, not on his
real achievements as a human being. And yet he cannot do without
the narcissistic inflation because his human core - conviction,
conscience, love and faith - is not very developed. Extremely
narcissistic persons are often almost forced to become famous,
since otherwise they might become depressed and insane. But it
takes much talent - and appropriate opportunities - to influence
others to such a degree that their applause validates these
narcissistic dreams. Even when such people succeed, they are
driven to seek further success, since for them failure carries
the danger of collapse. Popular success is, as it were, their
self-therapy against depression and madness. In fighting for
their aims, they are really fighting for their sanity.''<sup>12</sup>
Please take a careful look at who you voted for last.
<p>
Technocracy's proposal was that to operate the physical plant
that exists on North America what is required are only those
technically competent for the positions they hold. All that is
really required is to strip off the political and financial
superstructure that now sits on top of our society like a huge
cancer.
<p>
Who are the persons best qualified to choose the most technically
competent persons in any field? It is those who work directly
under them and those directly above them. We would no more want
the power to elect those that operate in areas of technical
competence than we would want to fly in an aircraft where the
passengers elect the pilot from among their midst.
<p>
One complaint frequently leveled at Technocracy is that such a
system would be a technical elite closed to any approach by
citizens outside their field. This is also untrue. A sequence of
social relations is attached to every local area control would
have direct access to every governing segment at the appropriate
level for answers or action far more so than today. Also the
social control proposed by Technocracy is completely market
driven in that the only things that would be produced would be
those things that people want.
<p>
Technocracy is the window and the doorway into the future of the
human race if we are somehow fortunate enough to survive the
incredible dangers presented to us by our current price system.
Technocracy Inc. offers a sane and genteel social system to
replace our current nuthouse.
<p>
<h3>Preventing Social Change</h3>
<p>
To those who wonder, if Technocracy is such a good idea, why
aren't people rushing in to demand its installation. We offer the
following five rules for preventing social change as given by one
author. Quoting:
<p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
  <li>LIMIT YOUR VISION: the long-standing american tradition of
ignoring the structural causes of social and individual problems
was mentioned previously. By pretending, for example, that
psychological disturbance has nothing to do with the societal
forces that shape personality development, you can help see to it
that those forces continue unabated. It follows that all
intervention should be done at the individual level. It is fine
to help, say, homeless people on a case-by case basis, but
inquiring into the policy decisions and economic arrangements
that have brought about their predicament would only serve to
invite drastic changes - and this is what we want to avoid at all
costs. Similarly, if we continue to treat each example of
corporate wrongdoing (from illegal dumping of toxic wastes to
bribing of public officials) as if it has occurred in a vacuum,
then we can mange to preserve the system responsible for these
acts.

  <li>ADAPT: The best way to keep the status quo intact is to make
sure that individuals adjust themselves to serve its needs.  Such
adaptation once was enforced by crude, authoritarian methods of
``re-education.'' Today this is hardly necessary. A wealth of
advice is available on how to become successful - what to wear,
how to negotiate, and so forth - and virtually all of it proceeds
from the premise that you should adjust yourself to conditions as
you find them. Adaptation is a critical part of the self-help
model: you must succeed within the institutions and according to
the rules that already exist. To do well is to fit in, and to fit
in is to fortify the structures into which you are being fit.

  <li>THINK ABOUT YOURSELF: Implicit in any exhortations to succeed
by ``giving them what they want'' is the suggestion that you should
be totally preoccupied with your own well-being. The more you
limit your concerns to yourself, the more you help to sustain the
larger system. But this does not apply merely to material
success. Even therapeutic and spiritual enterprises are useful
for preserving the status quo because in encouraging you to
attend to your own needs, they effectively direct attention away
from social structures. Groom yourself and let the rest of the
world go on its way - what better strategy is there for
perpetuating existing structures? A few people may argue, it is
true, that personal growth can be a route to social change. But
most of the human potential movement will not require you to
wrestle with this question, since social change is irrelevant to
its goals and techniques.

  <li>BE ``REALISTIC'': Fortunately, it is not necessary for you to
defend the larger system. You can even nod in sympathetic
agreement with someone who indicts it. But it is crucial that
this nodding be accompanied by a shrug. Phrases such as ``like it
or not'' and ``that's just the way it is'' should be employed
liberally in order to emphasize that nothing can be done about
the larger picture.  Such protestations of powerlessness are
actually very powerful, of course, since they make sure that
things are left exactly as they are. Every person who is
encouraged to takes such a stance is another person rescued from
social activism.
      <p>
Occasionally a critic will refuse to resign himself to the way
things are or to believe that we are helpless to make change.
Such an individual should immediately be labeled ``idealistic.'' Do
not be concerned about the vaguely complimentary connotations of
having ideals. It will be understood that an idealist is someone
who does not understand ``the world as it is'' (``world'' = ``our
society''; ``as it is'' = ``as it will always be''). This label
efficiently calls attention to the critic's faulty understanding
of reality of ``human nature'' and insures that he is not taken
seriously. Those who are ``pragmatic,'' by contrast, know that we
must always work within the confines of what we are given. After
all, if alternative models really were workable, we would already
be using them.
      <p>
Appeals to realism have the virtue of allowing you to avoid messy
discussions about the value of a critic's position (and thus of
the status quo). Why bother with such issues when you can dismiss
his vision as ``well-meaning but unworkable''? Challenging the
rightness of what he is proposing will only slow him down; it is
the appeal to practicality that produces the knockout. Call
someone wrongheaded or even evil and a lengthy discussion may
follow. Call him utopian or naive and there is nothing more to be
said. This method of dismissing models of change is uniquely
effective since it sets up a self-fulfulling prophecy. If enough
people insist that an alternative arrangement cannot work, they
will be right. Its failure then can be cited as substantiation of
one's original skepticism. No one uses this maneuver more
skillfully than policymakers who are mistrustful of public
institutions. Because of their conviction that governments can do
nothing right, they divert funds from public schools and
hospitals. When the inevitable crisis develops, they say, ``you
see?''
<p>
Appeals to realism can insure that institutions which threaten to
promote social change (e.g., legislative bodies, universities,
the media) do nothing but reflect the status quo. In the name of
democracy, descriptive accuracy, and objective journalism,
respectively, these institutions can be tamed and made into
powerful instruments for perpetuating whatever is in
place.......

<li>RATIONALIZE: It is easier for critics to oppose existing
institutions when those who defend and profit from them are
obviously opposed to social change.You can make it more difficult
for these critics - and salve your own conscience at the same
time - by claiming that your real reason for acting as you do is
to ``change the system from within.'' Like most people who talk
this way, of course, you do not actually have to make change. On
the contrary, even if this really were your goal, you would be
permitted to work only for insignificant reforms that never come
close to challenging the structures themselves. By becoming part
of these structures, you can proceed to seek personal
aggrandizement while at the same time contributing your talents
to something you profess to find problematic. (A variation on
this maneuver is to claim that you are going to do so for only a
short time - as if it were a simple matter to leave the fast lane
and get over to the exit ramp.) If you are audacious enough, you
can even rationalize your participation as the most effective way
to change the system. The more people who accept this reasoning
and follow your example, the more secure is that system.''<sup>13</sup>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>
All the people of North America must come to realize that they
all live in one society. If the society flounders, they will
suffer. We cannot save ourselves, by ourselves.
<p>
Technocracy veiws the comming challenges as a wonderful
opportunity to establish a new social system that would be the
crowning achievement of the human race. People must recover from
their feelings of helplessness and realize that a small
determined group can have tremendous influence by sheer
determination. The fact that Technocracy Inc. is here, after all
these years, under these circumstances, is proof of that.
