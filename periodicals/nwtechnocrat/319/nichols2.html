<p>
For mankind, emergence from the dark ages has been a long, slow 
and  painful, process.  Humans have made much progress in recent 
history, but, unfortunately, still have a long way to go before 
they can be satisfied with their accomplishments, especially in 
the way society is run.  Throughout history mankind has gone down one
blind alley after another, and it is only after fairly recent
breakthroughs in human thought that this progression has generated
enough speed to make any one century significantly different from the
one just past.  A major breakthrough occurred when mankind learned to
carefully examine the physical world in a factual manner without the
interference of superstition, or beliefs and opinions based on
superstition.  This ability resulted in the world of science we see
about us today.
<p>
Science is a storehouse of facts, and, additionally, science is a 
method for determining the most probable by the use of factual 
observation.  One scientific breakthrough after another has 
accelerated the progression of mankind, and each resulted in 
another liberation of humans from the bondage of superstition.  
This liberation has been fought every step of the way by the 
conservative elements of society who see any change as a threat to 
their ideals and to their positions of leadership.  As a result, 
even many scientists, especially those who have specialized in 
narrow fields of science,  have allowed themselves to be 
intimidated into becoming tools to be used, not for the benefit of 
society as a whole, but for the benefit of the few who can best 
afford their services.  This is another blind alley which leads to 
nowhere.
<p>
Our continuing emergence from the dark ages has been the result of 
the scientific method applied with intelligence to human 
activities. However this method hasn't been evenly applied to all 
activities.  Far more progress has been possible in some areas 
than in others.  For example:  For more than a half-century the 
technological ability to produce plenty for all North Americans 
has been available, while, at the same time, our methods of 
distribution have remained essentially the same throughout 
recorded history.  This lack of balance between production and 
distribution has resulted in widespread poverty in the midst of 
plenty.  Like idiots we destroy food to keep prices up, ignoring 
20 million Americans who are not properly fed.  This and many 
other problems can be corrected only when the scientific method is 
applied, with intelligence, to the problems of distribution -- the 
same type of intelligent method that has been applied to the 
problems of production.
<p>
The changes from a hand tool society to a highly technical society 
antiquates the methods of distribution mankind has used throughout 
history.  It changes the basic purpose of the distribution process 
from one of deciding who shall get how much of what and when, to a 
process of supplying the needs of each member of society.  When 
enough can be produced to satisfy the needs of all, then there is 
no reasonable reason why all should not have plenty.  For many 
unreasonable reasons this economy of scarcity, this buy and sell 
system, has not been allowed to change to an economy of plenty to 
match our technological ability to produce.  And abundance cannot 
be bought and sold for a price any more than the air we breathe 
can be bought and sold, and for the same reasons.  Further, there 
is no point in withholding from the poor unless one feels a need to 
be rich by comparison.  Another blind alley.
<p>
It is unlikely that people  ever thought they lived in a dark age.  
It is more likely that, at any given point in time, the majority 
opinion was that the present was an age of enlightenment.  It is not 
unusual for human thought and human action to be in quite 
different directions.  Consider the behavior of "modern" society 
in the good old U.S. of A.  We have the richest country in the 
world, and we have given billions to "help" other countries -- 
while, at the same time, we have 35 million Americans living in 
poverty.  We have sufficient nuclear weapons to destroy the world 
several times over, enough to make the earth uninhabitable for any 
living creature, and yet we continue to make more of these weapons 
by the thousands.  We have built over a hundred nuclear power 
plants at the same time that we have known that we have no safe 
place for the permanent disposal of high level nuclear waste.  We 
have a total debt of over $9 trillion, and it continues to 
increase at almost $1 trillion per year.  And year after year we 
continue to select a political leadership who are not solving our 
own problems at home while they insist on providing direction for 
the rest of the world.  How can we say we have completed our 
emergence from the dark ages?
<p>
The increasing imbalance between production and distribution has 
become a blind alley from which the only escape is to design an 
entirely new method of distribution, one which is as modern and as 
efficient as an automatic factory -- one which does not require 
the waste of non-replaceable natural resources and the resulting 
pollution of the physical environment.  This is not some "do-good" 
idea for a utopian society; it is a physical necessity for the 
survival of the human species.
<p>
The choice seems to be nothing less than one between chaos or survival
for mankind.  Why should a choice to survive be so difficult?  Simply
because the vast changes required to reverse the present economic and
environmental degradation will be very expensive, it will cost a very
large sum of money, perhaps more than the defense program has cost in
the past decade.  And it may be much less financially profitable.
Many people, some in high places, will not be mentally prepared to
accept the idea that such great expenditures can be necessary.
<p>
It is highly improbable that enough money can be found to pay off 
the present debt plus interest.  And it is even less likely that 
the trillions necessary for near future needs can be made 
available.  Let's face it money is obsolete!
<p>
The love of money has become so important in the affairs of people 
that many will kill for it; they will lie, cheat, steal and sell 
drugs to children.  Some will promote wars, charge the highest 
possible prices to increase profits, and some will charge the 
highest interest rates from everyone including their own 
government.
<p>
On a positive note:  Men are drafted to fight and die in wars, but 
who ever heard of money being drafted?  During  World War II, 
Technocracy proposed the total conscription of men, materiel and 
money for duration of the crisis.  But the operators of the Price 
System had a "good thing" going; so it wasn't done.
<p>
It would seem that North America has reached an impasse, stuck in 
a blind alley which has no exit.  And, indeed, this is the case if 
the citizens of this Continent are unable to extricate themselves 
from the dictates of this Price System method of social control 
before its collapse is complete.  If one must question this 
process of collapse then consider the many events now occurring 
and all at the same time.  We have an increasing debt which can 
never be paid, thus destroying confidence in the money; we have 
increasing crime and a serious drug problem.  Then there is AIDS, 
poverty, homelessness, scandals in high places, fraud on Wall 
Street and at the Pentagon, the Savings and Loan crisis, the 
foreign trade deficit, the deteriorating infrastructure and many 
others which one can add to by reading the daily press.  This system, 
the Price System, is the system which has caused, or allowed the 
development of all these problems.  Let us demonstrate the courage 
to face up to the fact that anyone who values their own survival 
would be foolish to depend on such a system.
<p>
Our own survival demands that the citizens of North America 
realize that the belief in a political democracy does not excuse, 
or justify an economic dictatorship.  A buy low and sell high 
system is a blind alley.  It is based on values which are 
determined by scarcity, and it was handed down from the dark ages.  
There is no way it can be made to distribute the plenty the 
technology of this Continent can produce.  An abundance can't be 
bought or sold.  A Price System can no longer operate effectively 
for the benefit of the citizens of this Continent, therefore a 
non-price system is necessary.  There is no other way to eliminate 
poverty, the drug business, the debt and environmental 
degradation.
<p>
After a transition period, a non-price system will also eliminate 
much of the human labor that now is required for the production of 
products designed to wear out and break.  Waste to maintain 
scarcity will be unnecessary, and we can abandon money and use a 
unit of measurement as a method of distribution and as a means of 
balancing production and consumption.  Simple?  Of course, since 
the problems of production have been solved why should 
distribution be so complicated?
<p>
Sometime in the future, if there is one, we can look back and 
laugh at our own blindness.  Future generations can read their 
history and marvel at the stupidity of their ancestors.  How could 
we have failed to understand the simple fact that we pay taxes to 
pay for maintaining a scarcity so that we can do without the 
plenty we can produce? And we go to great trouble to keep in 
operation an economy of scarcity.  However, the future hasn't 
arrived yet, and in order to get there we must find our way 
through a very dangerous period.  It is no laughing matter; people 
have never gone through a major social change as a result of 
intelligent action; they have always failed to understand why 
change is necessary and their "leaders" have been terrorized at 
the thought that major changes might require a more intelligent 
leadership.  It is nothing new for the leaders of society to 
refuse to admit that change is necessary.  And never before has a 
change so great occurred in the way we humans live, in the way we 
do our work, and the resulting change in human concepts required 
for living in a time and place where the human energy required for 
operating the means of production has declined from 98 to 2 
percent.  Never before has a nation of people been able to cut 
working hours in half while producing 20 times as much.
<p>
For over 50 years, over a half-century, a design for the distribution
of plenty to all citizens of this Continent has been available.  All
North Americans should have been informed about this design many years
ago. Why haven't they?  Don't wait for the chief beneficiaries of this
Price System to inform you concerning anything which is unprofitable
to themselves.  If we are not willing to make the effort to solve this
problem, or if the plenty which will be available is not a sufficient
incentive, then, please be reminded that the survival of our
civilization is at stake -- it is that urgent!
