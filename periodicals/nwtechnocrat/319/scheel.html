<em>If you can't trust Webster or the Encyclopedia 
Americana... well, who can you trust?</em>
<p>
As new educators come along to update the definitions for 
dictionaries and encyclopedias, the truth sometimes becomes 
fractured along the way, just as a tale of gossip gains in 
mythical momentum the more it is told and tramples facts into 
obfuscation.
<p>
Most people hold faith in their dictionaries and encyclopedias.  
Why shouldn't they?  After all, aren't these bastions of 
information based on truths gathered by learned educators?  They 
wouldn't dare distort these truths, knowing how much the public 
relies on dictionaries and encyclopedias for factual information.  
They would go to the proper source, if necessary, to get correct 
information.
<p>
<em>Or would they?</em>
<p>
Consider this:  According to <cite>Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary</cite>, 
1981 edition, <em>political</em> means ``adept at, sensitive to, or 
involving politics and esp., party politics.''  And what does 
<em>apolitical</em> mean?  According to the same dictionary, it means 
``having an aversion for or having no interest in political 
affairs.''  Well enough,  These seem to be reasonable definitions.
<p>
<!-- this paragraph was omitted from the NWT printing -->
In this same edition of Webster's, theism is defined as ``belief in the
existence of a god or gods.''  So shouldn't atheism be defined as
``disbelief in the existence of a god or gods''?  (apolitical--atheism)
It is, but Webster saw the need to add ``wickedness'' and ``ungodliness''
to this definition, somthing you don't find in most old
dictionaries. When the head honcho at Webster's was approached on this
discrepancy in definitions, he wrote: ``You need to understand that
words are defined as they are used in a certain time period.''  So,
evidently writers of definitions can incorporate their own use of a
word with impunity.  And in this age of fundamentalism and TV
preachers, is it any wonder that atheism has taken on new meaning?  Is
Mark Twain, that intelligent man of words and compassion, now
considered ``wicked'' because he embraced atheism?
<p>
In the 1939, 1940 editions of The Encyclopedia Americana, Harry 
Elmer Barnes, noted historian, said this about Technocracy:  
``Whatever the future of Technocracy, one must fairly say that it 
is the only program of social and economic reconstruction that is 
in complete intellectual and technical accord with the age in 
which we live.''
<p>
The late H.G. Wells stated:  ``Essentially Technocracy is a soundly 
scientific effort to restate economics on a purely physical 
basis.''
<p>
The Concise Oxford Dictionary defined Technocracy as:  ``An 
organization and management of a country's industrial resources 
by technical experts for the good of the whole community.''
<p>
These definitions all say much the same thing but in different 
words.  The studies of Technocracy embrace the entire fields of 
science and industry.  Biology, climate, natural resources and 
industrial equipment all enter into the social picture.  
Technocracy is dealing with social phenomena in the widest sense 
of the word, including not only actions of human beings but also 
everything that directly or indirectly affects their actions.  No 
one can expect to have any understanding of our present social 
problems without having at least a panoramic view of the basic 
relationships of these essential elements of the picture.
<p>
Factual definitions on Technocracy and its objectives like those 
quoted above were on the wane as was shown in the 1959 edition of 
The Encyclopedia Americana.  Written by Richard P. Cecil, perhaps 
a political science teacher, he called Technocracy an American 
``reform'' group.  He should know that Technocracy is a research, 
educational organization whose objectives are to prepare the 
people of this North American Continent for social change; and 
Technocracy isn't trying to reform anyone!  ``Technocrats 
believe...'' he says.  He should understand that Technocracy is not 
a ``belief'' system.  Its members accept facts on social trends as 
researched by Technocracy and other reliable sources.  
Technocrats are required to <em>know</em>.  Not <em>believe</em>.
``Government will be in the hands of technical experts,'' says Cecil.
Most dictionaries and encyclopedias today would have the public 
believe that Technocracy means a country ruled by scientists and 
technologists.  But Technocracy is for the people directly and 
offers the greatest latitude of personal choice within the limits 
set by nature.  In view of environmental degradation, which didn't 
just start yesterday, Technocracy has tried through the years to 
inform the people of the necessity of understanding the bounds of 
nature.  The same technical experts who are holding this Continent
together today would still be holding this Continent together in a 
Technate only without the interference of politics and money -- 
in other words, an intelligent social operation of North America, 
with technology under the direction of science.
<p>
The Encyclopedia Americana's most recent edition (1987) meanders 
even deeper into obfuscation.  ``Technocracy was a radical social 
movement and philosophy that exploded into prominence in the 
United States in the early 1930s,'' says Sherman E. Gunderson of 
Wisconsin State University.  He, too, should understand that 
Technocracy's scientific research on social trends is based on the 
firm foundation of fact; it is not philosophy of any kind.  Any 
new scientific idea is considered radical:  first it is 
suppressed; second it is ridiculed; and third it is accepted.  
Technocracy's blueprint for a social system that is compatible 
with our advancing technology and existing resources will some day 
reach that third stage.  It has endured through the first and 
second stages.
<p>
Gunderson gives Thorsten Veblen credit for being the ``chief 
intellectual source of Technocracy.''  This simply is not so.  
Thorsten Veblen wrote articles for Dial Magazine based on meetings 
with the Technical Alliance, forerunner of Technocracy.   Howard 
Scott was the intellectual source of Technocracy along with 
Willard Gibbs, Nicola Tesla and Steinmetz, to name a few.  
Veblen's articles were later incorporated in his book, ``The 
Engineers and the Price System'' (1921).  Price System was 
Technocracy's term, not Veblen's.  Veblen eventually allied 
himself with the raisin king, Ardzrooni, as his last few Dial 
articles were undoubtedly masterminded by Ardzrooni.  The 
economists and sociologists associated with Veblen, an educator, 
became frightened in 1919 about the ideas and social implications 
of Technocracy, and they drifted toward the liberalism that was a 
prime exhibit of the New School for Social Research and other 
accredited education institutions.
<p>
Had either Richard P. Cecil or Sherman E. Gunderson taken the time 
to contact Technocracy Headquarters or any Technocracy Section 
across the Continent, they could have come up with a factual 
definition, but since fact doesn't seem to be a requirement in 
either Webster or the Encyclopedia Americana, why bother.  At 
least Cecil said that the Technocracy movement has persisted.  But 
Gunderson talks as though it may have faded away.  The only reason 
Technocracy seemed to have ``faded rapidly'' is because William 
Randolph Hearst and others of his ilk issued orders to every 
newspaper official that the name Technocracy was not to be used 
under any condition whatsoever.  They would be subject to 
dismissal and severance from their organization if they did so.  
Technocracy posed a threat to those who seek power.  So if a new 
idea that has been heavily publicized in the national news media 
is suddenly silenced by those in power without the public knowing 
why...of course it seems to fade rapidly.  The sabotage of silence 
against Technocracy has worked well.  Writers of 
famous encyclopedias and dictionaries and national newspapers 
don't know where to find the facts about Technocracy, so they 
resort to fiction.
<p>
Funk and Wagnalls' 1976 edition of their ``New Encyclopedia'' says 
that Technocracy is a ``theoretical'' system of government...and 
that it offered a ``political'' system based on scientific and 
physical laws.  Funk and Wagnalls has been corrected on their 
flawed definition and was sent Technocracy literature to help set 
the record straight.  They were considerate enough to send a 
letter, saying they would correct the definition in their next 
edition.  The next 1978 edition printed the same definition as the 
1976 edition.  So you can't trust Funk and Wagnalls either.
<p>
One can't help but wonder what other meanderings of obfuscation 
can be found in Webster dictionaries and Americana and Funk and 
Wagnalls encyclopedias.
