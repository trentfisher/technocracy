Response from Jack Bergel:
<p>
"Your latest article, Rocky Mountain News, 9/27/89, <cite>POTENTIAL 
TIANENMEN SQUARES ABOUND IN AMERICA</cite>, outlines our social danger 
very well.  Has America awakened to this and our other severe 
social economic problems?  No -- apathy, indifference and ignorance 
still prevail.
<p>
"This part of our planet Earth has the potential to become the 
finest example for human contentment and prosperity in recorded 
history.  The area of North America has the capacity, through its 
science and technology, to provide every citizen with a high 
standard of living without the social problems that threaten our 
survival today.  Because of this fact, which is verifiable, that 
your personal survey revealed about the hungry in breadlines, 
waiting for hours for food, shows the sad inability of the 
political process within the Price System monetary structure to 
resolve problems of hunger and poverty.  Or any other.
<p>
"There is a good reason for the above social obscenity.  We have 
some people in the intellectual segment of society, sincere and 
well meaning, who would continue to try to reform the system, when 
all the facts show that is exactly what we have been doing for 
many years and our problems are worse than ever and heading in the 
direction of catastrophe.  This, you pointed out in the article 
referred to.  We have evolved long past the era of reform in our 
social structure.  A major social/economic reconstruction is our 
only chance to avoid the widespread street violence you foresee.  
There is much use of the phrase, 'American system,' in referring 
to the Price System we live in.  Actually, it was an import from
Europe, a hangover from medieval days before the advent of modern
science and technology.  Monetary values with its concomitant debt
structure and exchange values cannot exist side by side with a complex
technological operation.  They are totally diametrically opposed and
is the primary reason attempts to reform are a waste of time and
exceedingly dangerous to all life.  We really do need a North American
system in fact as well as in name. It must be compatible with the
dynamic equilibrium (ever changing balance) 
of the technology that has now taken over the North American 
continent, but controlled by those who do not understand its 
function.  Any progression of this kind, once started, must 
continue to evolve, or die.
<p>
"Because of the above facts, we can no longer live with the 
illusion that major change can be postponed indefinitely as it 
could be in the Old World we on this continent have left forever.  
We no longer have this kind of luxury, for advances in technology 
will no longer allow the time gap between new discoveries and 
economic application.  There are countless examples to make this 
point evident.
<p>
"Penicillin remained on a laboratory shelf for some 15 to 20 years 
before it was accepted and used for its life saving qualities, 
until it was superseded by a later remedy.  Today, with a world 
of disease like cancer and aids with its growing menace, we dare 
not repeat the penicillin time lag or we flirt with a medical and 
social disaster.
<p>
"It took over 450 years for the church to acknowledge the error in 
the persecution of Galileo for the scientific discovery that the 
earth revolved around the sun and not the other way around.  
Recently, Pope Pius, in Pisa, Italy, said Galileo was right and 
the church was wrong.
<p>
"These two examples out of the many hundreds available show the 
time lag between scientific discovery and acceptance.  In between 
these two time factors, those pressing for examination of 
discoveries and social use, were and are now, in modern times, 
ignored, vilified and otherwise treated shabbily.  Up to this 
time in history this lag of time has caused suffering, misery and 
deaths -- but has not, up to now, threatened human survival.  
Prior to the advent of technology, slow moving events allowed 
procrastination, ignorances and indifference to prevail for the 
most part.  This is no longer the case,
<p>
"To face modern social/economic events that require change, we 
cannot hide behind a time lag that no longer can be played with.  
there is no lengthy time in which we can divert the facts with 
myths, opinions and futile reforms for a system that is dying as a 
result of its own built-in self-destruct factors -- helped along 
by those who do not understand the requirements involved in 
technological change.  Events of a physical nature are now moving 
at speeds never before experienced by us.  There is a widespread 
modern myth that we must wait for an improvement in morals before 
there can be an improvement in the social affairs of people here.  
Ignored is the ability to apply science to the social structure 
while human nature remains as it has been from the beginning of 
time.  Human behavior, however, will change in accordance with the 
changes made that are not in conflict with human nature.  In 
dealing with social change it is necessary to understand the 
difference between nature and human behavior.
<p>
"On a scale figured by scientist Carl Sagan, we have been on earth 
about one minute, taking into account the over four billion years 
of earth's existence and looking at that as one month.  In that 
time we have squandered much of the carbon, oxygen and hydrogen 
necessary for the continuation of life.  We are destroying the 
forests, the vital grasslands, the water sources that are potable, 
the air we breathe, the food we eat; and our industries poison us 
with sulphur dioxide that comes at us as acid rain.  We 
are losing our ozone shield that protects from radiation, while we 
add billions of people to share in the coming suffering and 
misery.  As one author stated, 'Folks -- we are blowing it.'
<p>
"So, Technocrats ask -- when do the intellectuals break out of the 
social manacles that keep them confined within the framework of 
Price System dilly-dallying with symptoms of the problem and not 
take a look at the basic facts available.  There is not much time 
left and we had better use what there is.
<p>
"The people of North America are waiting for the leadership that 
can face and deal with physical reality.  Your help, Mr. Cousins, 
and others of your courage and intelligence is badly needed."
