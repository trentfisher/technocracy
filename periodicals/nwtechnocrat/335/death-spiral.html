People never change their social system for light reasons.  They must be
convinced beyond any shadow of doubt that the system they currently have will
not work and cannot be fixed.   Quite possibly the number one motto of the
human race is " if it isn't broke, don't fix it".  This reasoning is an
important human biological defense mechanism.  Had the human race gone through
its existence jumping from one thing to another because it seemed like a good
idea at the time,  chances are we would not be here now looking at these
words.
<p>
The real question is "just how much pain is required to convince people that
the system needs to be replaced?"  By observation of such situations the answer
seems to be - quite a bit.  The demise of the bureaucratic socialist regimes of
Eastern Europe has drawn many to the conclusion that the "free" enterprise
system really is the best system after all.  But many more sober observers can
only conclude that the market system or more accurately, price system on North
America cannot be far behind.  For over sixty years Technocracy Inc. has been
stating that the forces of applied technology and the energy that runs the
technology would inevitably force the collapse of the price system on the North
American continent.
<p>
The price system was designed some seven thousand years ago under very
different conditions than those of today.  Such a system works quite well in an
agrarian society.  In 1830 seventy percent of the U.S. population lived and
worked in agriculture directly or indirectly.  Life for the upper classes was
pleasant enough while harsh and austere for those in the lower classes.  The
same system has been distorted in highly destructive directions by the forces
of applied technology and energy.
<p>
<H2>Economic Disintegration</H2>
<p>
As more technology is applied the errors generated by a social system out of
control increase proportionally.  The small fraction of the population that
actually runs the society is concerned only with its own interest and it
equates those interests with the interests of the whole society.  The governing
attitude is that as long as those with money are happy all is well with
society.  If statistics don't seem to bear this out then the statistics are
simply changed or the facts are ignored.
<p>
Those who control the society are deeply afraid of any group offering a
different point of view that contradicts their own view of society.  They go to
great lengths to ensure that the viewpoints they propound are the only ones
heard.  It is important to realize that these people are trapped in a prison of
their own making.  Ignoring the facts will not change them.  The forces of
social change are not driven by opinion but by the relentless force of applied
technology.  Enforcing ignorance of the direction our social system is moving
only guarantees that social change will be more difficult and dangerous.
<p>
Those in charge of the system seem to have completely lost control of it.  The
national debt is expanding exponentially which will shortly financially
destabilize the system, possibly destroying it once and for all.  The savings
and loan crisis is instructive.  Despite ten years of warning and many valiant
efforts by people who could see what was coming nothing was done to avert the
collapse of these institutions.  The cost to each U.S. citizen will be about
two thousand dollars.  This was a crisis that was generated out of simple
incompetence on the part the governing bodies of the social system.  One can
rest assured that many of those same people who generated this giant fraud will
also profit mightily from it.
<p>
Industries have now gone international.  Automobiles are assembled from parts
made all over the world.  Personal computers have always been made this way.
Industries migrate to where labor costs are lowest and environmental
regulations unheard of or unenforced if they do exist.  The theory goes that
people in these regions will be economically uplifted by the jobs provided and
will increase their spending, raising everyone's standard of living.  What
actually occurs is that wages are so minimal that only the barest survival is
possible and the work is so harsh that workers are quickly exhausted.  The
industries destroy the environment and the people of the region, take the
profits, and move on.
<p>
<H2>Environmental Disintegration</H2>
<p>
A plague of locust has stood as a symbol for devastation throughout written
history but it is certainly no worse than a plague of humans.  Today soil is
being destroyed or degraded at the fastest rate in history.  It is hard to
imagine any resource more important to human existence than soil with the
exception of air and fresh water.  Without soil there will be no food.  With
the human population of the earth heading toward the five billion mark it can
be stated with certainty that if food production cannot be maintained a
disaster awaits.  
<p>
Soil is being eroded the fastest in areas that have the highest population
densities and where the people are poorest.  The reason for this is that when
people are that poor they have no time for the consideration of anything but
the next meal.  If the result of them getting their next meal is further
degradation of the soil that produced the meal then that is too bad.  Systems
analysts like to call such a system positive feedback.  The worse things
become, the more incentive there is for making them still worse.  This is a
self accelerating catastrophe.
<p>
The wealthy nations for years have been, and still are, pouring tons of
pesticides on their crops to protect them from the ravages of insects, with
typical shortsightedness, arrogantly assuming that the only enemy was the bugs.
It is now known that one gram of ordinary agricultural soil contains: one
hundred million individual bacteria, fifty to one hundred fifty meters of
fungal material, ten thousand to one hundred thousand protozoa, and five to two
thousand nematodes(Oregon Scientist Fall 1993).  Pesticides and herbicides are
making the soil sterile, while at the same time poisoning our water supplies.
<p>
Fresh water constitutes only three percent of the world's water.  Most of the
earth's fresh water rivers are used as open sewers.  Reversing this is
expensive and time consuming.  Point sources of pollution such as industrial
plants are easy to see.  But run-off from polluted farm land is far more
difficult to deal with.  
<p>
Ground water that took centuries to accumulate is being drawn down at
staggering rates.  Vast tracts of land that now produce food will be forced out
of production as that water dries up.  Some sixty years ago Technocracy Inc.
offered a Continental Hydrology plan that among many other benefits would help
to recharge the ground water losses and preserve our fresh water resources.
But the price system is not interested in plans that do not produce immediate
profit for private enterprise. When the last well has run dry where will the
profiteers go next?  
<p>
Many negative environmental impacts have occurred from building dams, but none
of these need have occurred with proper planning.  The overriding criteria in
the application of all technology is how can the most money be made, not how
can this be put to the best use.  When money is the governing criteria rather
than people, a good outcome is just a lucky accident.  That does not mean the
technology is bad, it means that it was improperly applied.
<p>
Garbage has piled up into a national nuisance and new garbage dumps are only
welcome in the poorest of communities where that is the only source of income.
In Mexico City it sometimes "rains" dry snow consisting of human fecal matter (
The Population Explosion by P. &amp; A. Ehrlich).  Garbage burners poorly
designed and poorly controlled pollute the air with poisonous effluent.
<p>
There is the very real possibility that, as population pressures continue to
mount, all negative environmental impacts could peak at nearly the same time,
causing a sudden large reduction in the food supply across the entire world.
The result would be similar to what is now occurring in sub-Saharan Africa:
Millions of refugees pouring across borders to other countries that are no
better off.  The impact on the social fabric would be nearly immediate,
massive, and drastic.
<p>
<H2>Social Disintegration</H2>
<p>
The impacts of social decay are reflected in a rapidly rising crime rate.
Jails fill to overflowing on a regular basis and are forced to release
criminals back into the street having served little or no time.  In Portland,
Oregon tickets are passed out for stealing a car.  Virtually no police time is
allotted to the matter.  Citizens are instructed to deal with the problem
themselves.  Murder has become a commonplace event.  Not only are the streets
not safe, but people are not safe in their own homes.  The United States has
more people in prison than any other country in the world and the level of
crime is higher than any other.
<p>
If there is one relationship that has been thoroughly explored, it is the
relation between crime and economics.  As economic pressures increase so does
crime.  Threatening people with harsh sentences is meaningless to someone who
is hungry.  Criminal activity is generated by hopelessness and despair.
<p>
Youth gangs now infiltrate every segment of society in every community.  They
can see no future for themselves in legitimate society and have given up even
trying.  Most have little or no education thus guaranteeing no future, assuming
one were available.  Many have consigned themselves to living short fast lives
in the drug trade.  In the U.S. twenty percent of all children go to bed hungry
at night.  The U.S. standard of prenatal care is the worst of all the
industrialized countries.  This guarantees a large number of people who will be
dependent on society for the rest of their lives.  Apparently the worlds
richest country has no money for its children. 
<p>
Slavery is increasing across the entire planet as the number of people
increases beyond the ability of the society to absorb them.  Slavery is now
rapidly increasing in all nations.  The value placed on human life is headed
toward a new low.  Life is so bad for some of these people that even the
alternative of being sold into slavery doesn't seem so bad.  One can't also
help but wonder at what kind of people employ slaves.  This is, of course, the
end of the search for the ultimate in low cost labor for international business
in labor intensive industries.
<p>
As economic conditions worsen tensions between different groups of people will
rise.  Racism and intolerance for others will increase.  Hate groups will gain
strength.  This is fueled by ignorance, fear, and intolerance.  But at the root
of all such problems is economic insecurity.
<p>
<H2>A Solution</H2>
<p>
Technocracy Inc. has pointed out for years that it doesn't have to be this way.
The collapse of the price system is the greatest opportunity for human
advancement in the last seven thousand years.  Technocracy has done no more
than state the obvious.  If the price system is collapsing, then we will have
to find a way to organize a society on a non price basis.  Technocracy Inc.
offers such a plan for the North American Continent.  Technocracy is willing to
bet that North Americans will not voluntarily starve to death in the middle of
the worlds greatest supermarket.
<p>
It is important to understand that human freedom is not guaranteed by the words
written on some piece of paper, no matter how wonderfully phrased or solemnly
sworn to by any number of people.  There is nothing wrong with such
declarations as an indication of intent or of an ideal to be desired.  The only
real guarantee of human freedom that is at all meaningful is the lack of a
reason to restrict it.  As long as a price system exists people will be bought
and sold just like any other commodity.  People are not inherently evil but
some of the rules that they are forced to operate under make it impossible to
be otherwise.  Change the rules and you change the people.
<p>
That small fraction of the population that controls our society has decided
that it alone has the right to determine the direction of the whole society.
Not too surprisingly, this consists of them continuing to do what they have
been doing, only more of it.  It is this mysterious "they" who decide what the
whole society is to think and what ideas are fit for public consumption.
Today, twenty six or fewer giant corporations control virtually all the mass
media of communication in the U.S.  (Who Will Tell The People by William
Greider)  This control is subtle but highly effective - anyone who doesn't have
the "right" ideas has no access to the media.
<p>
It is the vain hope of such people that by ignoring ideas they dislike any
social change can be prevented.  (The Culture of Contentment by J.K. Galbraith)
They are wrong of course.  Many of the great philosophers have noted the value
of freedom of speech and thought but one doesn't have to appeal to such.  If it
is possible for humanity to lay claim to superiority among the animals it is
the use of the human brain.  In order for that to be truly effective there must
be a free flow of ideas available to be pondered, debated, altered to fit new
circumstance, examined and finally accepted or rejected for valid reasons.
Without a free flow of ideas humanity is little better that a mammalian anthill
following its leaders in whatever direction they choose.  At the moment those
leaders are orchestrating a massive collision with history.
<p>
Our civilization hangs by a very slender thread.  It would not take a large
disruption to destroy it.  The major industries by which we live are operated
by a rapidly decreasing number of highly skilled people with knowledge so
specialized that it is rare.  All that is necessary is to ask virtually anyone
who would they call if the electric power in their area stopped.  The most
obvious answer is to call the power company.  Now, suppose that there is no one
to answer the phones?  How many people are there in any given area who know how
to reconnect the power system?  Who are they?  Who knows?  Without electricity
our civilization would shortly cease to function.  It is not difficult to
multiply this same scenario by many other vital functions.  Where does the food
in the supermarkets come from?  The frightening answer to questions such as
this is exactly the reason why Technocracy Inc. was formed as an organization.
<p>
Technocracy Inc. offers the only next step possible to a new stage of human
social development.  Technocracy offers the greatest freedom the human race has
ever known, by removing not only the reason to restrict it but by also removing
the means (money) to restrict it.  It has also been observed down through the
centuries that the government that governs best is the one that governs least.
Again the only function of the government proposed by Technocracy is to
organize the means of production to provide the people of North American with
the highest standard of living possible.  
<p>
Americans are like a blind man standing on the edge of a precipice.  We can
descend into the world of violence, misery, hatred, and chaos from which there
may be no returning or we can remove the blind folds,  grab our courage, and
move forward into the unending vistas presented by Technocracy.
