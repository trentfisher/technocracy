When the federal government released the March unemployment 
figures, a lot of people were not counted.  Some economists, those 
who paint the harshest portrait of the economy to justify 
government intervention, think they should be counted.
<p>
There are many millions of unemployed people with some very sad 
stories to tell about how they were forced out of their jobs by
others' seniorities and by company cutbacks. 8.5 million individuals
make up the 6.8% published unemployment rate in March, but there are
about 7.1 million who are part-timers seeking full-time status and
those who have given up looking. Lawrence Mishel, research director of
the Economic Policy Institute in Washington says ``What you really
have is a total unemployment and under-employment rate of 12.4%.

Technocracy has pointed out that, as technology is employed, people 
are disemployed.  It is high time that people realize that 
politicians cannot supply solutions to this kind of problem no 
matter who is voted for.  It is very unfortunate that conditions 
have to get to this stage before people begin to question what is 
going on in the country, and these conditions can only get worse.
<p>
The only solution to the problem is to change from the present 
system of political government to a system of functional 
government -- where everyone can benefit instead of only a few.
