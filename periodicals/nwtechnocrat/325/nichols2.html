<em><strong>Progress:</strong> To move forward, to grow, advance,
develop, and to improve.</em>
<p>
With this definition, human progress, then, would be the 
development or improvement of human knowledge creating movement 
forward, an advance toward a better living condition.  Where this 
progress ends, if it does end, will depend on the future 
development of human knowledge, the materials we have to work with 
and the ability to avoid catastrophes, both natural and man-made.
<p>
Since the earth's resources are not evenly distributed over the 
world, it can be expected that some areas would develop faster 
than others.  And as technological know-how advances, one should 
expect such areas, if not overwhelmed with over-population, to 
reach a point that plenty could be produced for all citizens.
<p>
Over many thousands of years man learned to use the club; this was 
an advance which added to his protection and assisted in the 
gathering of food.  He learned to use fire, to cultivate plants, 
and he domesticated certain animals.  All of which contributed to 
his food supply, increased his ability to live in colder climates 
and allowed his species to increase.  Thus, man widened the gap 
between himself and other species of life.  This progression 
occurred slowly over many centuries, but then faster as his 
knowledge increased.
<p>
This whole progression has increased in speed as a result of each
major innovation, and, in areas with sufficient materials, it leaped
forward with an amazing acceleration together with the discovery of
the scientific method. As a demonstration of this acceleration,
perhaps nothing could be as dramatic as the declining percentage of
human labor in the total supply of energy required for the operation
of human society. When the use of the scientific method began, the
contribution of human energy was around 98 percent of the total.
Since the introduction of science
and engineering methods into human affairs, this 98 percent has
dropped to less than 2 percent.  Now, in 1991, in the United
States and Canada, human energy supplies less than 2 percent of 
the total required for the entire social operation, while more 
than 98 percent is supplied by sources outside the human body.  At 
the same time, the total energy used has increased by some 40 
times.  Energy from coal, oil, gas, falling water and nuclear are 
now doing most of the work.
<p>
This shift from the predominant use of "human" muscle to "non-
human" muscle has created an unbelievable increase in the ability 
to produce.  It has allowed the production of hundreds of items, 
the building of hundreds of facilities, and transportation and 
communication activities which would have been impossible in the 
past.   After getting under way about the time the U.S. was 
founded in 1776, the most rapid development has been since 1900.  
It has occurred so fast that improvements in social control and 
distribution techniques haven't kept pace, and it is in these areas 
that humans must increase their efficiency.
<p>
This extraordinary increase in the use of extraneous energy, 
supplying the power for the greatest technological mechanism the 
world has ever known, has created problems never before 
encountered by mankind.  It has changed the face of the earth; it 
has expanded the dependence on the earth's resources to 
unprecedented levels, and it has increased the pollution of the 
earth proportionally.  It has made it possible for more people to 
live longer lives which consequently requires more resources  
resulting in more damage to the environment than ever before.  
This has been one of the major costs of human progress to date.
<p>
Such an order of magnitude of physical change cannot continue 
without major revisions in the attitudes of mankind toward the 
environment, both physical and economic.  Opposition to 
behavioral changes that required mankind to adapt to new 
circumstances have been ignored, and this has resulted in much of 
the environmental and economic degradation now in process.  As the 
human population is increased; as the earth's resources are 
further depleted, it is absolutely necessary that human behavior 
be modified to match the physical requirements of life on a finite 
planet.  Progress is not without its problems, and the lack of 
communication, human inertia and hostility are not the least of 
them.
<p>
It is high time for human consideration of the increasing problems 
caused by this progression.  Intentionally or not, humans have 
chosen this road, this human progress, and they must determine 
whether or not it can be maintained and for how long.  We can't 
put the cubic miles of oil or the coal and the gas that we have 
burned back into the ground in their original state; they are gone 
beyond usefulness. We can't easily decrease the human population 
to the numbers which could be supported by the hand tool methods 
of the past.  In the physical world, history is irreversible; it 
never repeats itself.  We have started a progression that we can't 
reverse; we can only make the necessary modifications to sustain 
the progress we have made while limiting our waste in the use of 
non-replaceable resources; this is our chance for survival -- we 
don't have a choice.
<p>
We live in the only world known with the ability to support human 
life; it is a physical world of matter and energy which operates 
in accordance with natural laws; and the limits of physical growth 
are the limitations imposed by the physical character of the 
natural world.  For example, the earth cannot support one person 
per sq. ft. of arable soil.  The earth has only 6.7 million square 
miles or arable soil, or about 1/7 of the total land area.  At 
present the human population is increasing at almost 100 million 
per year.  This is enough to replace the entire population of the 
U.S. in TWO AND ONE HALF YEARS.  And this is occurring at the same 
time that the amount of arable soil is diminishing as a result of 
the demands of an increasing population.
<p>
Few people have been taught to understand physical growth in that 
actual physical world in which we live, and the physical 
limitations of that growth.  Where conditions are favorable for 
growth, the increase starts slowly then grows more rapidly at a 
compound rate.  Which means it doubles as a function of time.  
Obviously this cannot continue forever, or this one phenomenon would
fill the world, allowing room for nothing else. The rate of growth
inevitably must slow, doubling at greater lengths of time until it
levels off with no further growth. In fact, a negative growth may then
occur. As an example, the use of oil increased rapidly during this
century, but as the supply dwindles, the rate of its use must level
off then decline. There are limits to the growth in the use of any
non-replaceable resource and there are limits to the growth of the
human population which requires
these resources to sustain life.  New discoveries and new 
technology have allowed population growth far beyond that which 
could have been possible in pre-technological ages.  As the 
population increases, the use and the wastage of the earth's 
resources also increases.  As the population growth approaches the 
limits imposed by the limited supply of resources, the population 
must level off and will probably decline thereafter.
<p>
In many nations of the earth the human population is already too 
great for their existing resources to supply more than a meager 
standard of living.  And with the present degree of knowledge in 
those areas, any resources supplied by others will only result in 
a further increase in their population and an even smaller ability 
to solve their population problems.  This means that the fewer who 
starve today results in more starvation in the future.  The areas 
that have resources in sufficient quantities to supply their own 
needs but who then attempt to share them with all the deficit 
nations, will soon be without themselves.  Then all the earth's 
people can starve together.
<p>
So the only choice mankind has is to limit population growth in a 
humane manner.  To allow this growth to continue in spite of the 
deterioration of his environment, wasting natural resources and 
polluting and reducing the earth's ability to support humanity 
until the population is limited by starvation, should be seen to 
be unacceptable.  As physical limits are approached, it will be 
ever more difficult to maintain any population growth.  In fact, 
many of the earth's present 5.4 billion people are hungry and 
depend on handouts from more fortunate areas to support their 
present population.
<p>
Where are we going?  Where will all this progress take us?  What 
is our goal, and how will we know when we get there?  It seems 
that everyone has been so busy attempting to cope with present 
personal problems, making money for their own personal interests 
and trying to just stay alive in a dog-eat-dog financial 
environment, that few have had, or have been willing, to devote the 
time to determine the direction and the probable destination of 
society as a whole.
<p>
At any rate, one way or another, mankind must progress toward a 
stable population.  Then, after it has leveled off, it is almost 
certain to decline to some level which will be in a state of 
dynamic equilibrium with other earth processes and resources.  In 
the future, the wastage of non-recurring natural resources will 
likely be considered a crime against mankind.  It would be so 
considered today if the limits of physical growth were better 
understood.
<p>
With the discovery of the scientific method, the operating 
mechanism of the world's people began to split into two different 
worlds.  The parts which had the materials with which to work 
progressed into an entirely different kind of society, more 
advanced with better living standards and far less man-hours per 
unit of production.  The areas which didn't have the necessary 
materials continued operating according to the dictates of what is 
called a "low energy society."
<p>
The people of the areas which presently have the natural 
resources, the technology, and the know-how to solve their own 
problems, economic and environmental, must do so.  If they can't, 
or won't, then all the human progress so far achieved will have 
been for nothing.
<p>
The area that has the best, and quite possibly the only, chance 
to contribute a real solution to solving their own economic and 
environmental problems is the United States and Canada -- 
considered as a unified Continent.  This North American Continent 
has 1.6 acres of arable soil per capita, which is enough for the 
people who live here but not enough to share much with others.  
The same is true for most other resources. This Continent has the 
necessary physical requirements, if properly cared for and used 
efficiently, to eliminate poverty on this Continent, but not the 
requirements to do so for the rest of the world.  When, and if, we 
have solved our own problems at home, after we have gained the 
experience required to take care of our own people, learned the 
economic necessities, we will then, and only then, be in a 
position to advise other nations concerning humane methods for 
reducing their population to match their available resources and 
to create their technology possible according to their physical 
capabilities.  Until we have learned these things ourselves we 
can't provide effective assistance to other countries; we can only 
continue to mess up their condition more than it already is.  If 
we don't know how to feed our people at home when we have plenty 
of food, how can we expect to feed the world which doesn't have 
the food?
<p>
At this particular time in history, the people of North America 
must concentrate on solving North American problems.  This is the 
best possible procedure for the citizens of this, and all other 
countries.  If the U.S. and Canada can't do this, then the 
opportunity may be lost for all time.  If the U.S. and Canada 
can't do this, when they have all the physical requirements 
necessary, then it can only be because they don't have the 
intelligence to do so.  If the leadership, political or otherwise, 
of the U.S. and Canada can't provide the leadership to do this, 
then the citizens of these two countries must find a method for 
selecting a leadership which can.  The future, if any, of the 
human species depends on it.
<p>
When a country has developed the physical ability to provide 
plenty for all it's citizens, no person should qualify as 
a "leader" who would refuse to allow the elimination of poverty, 
homelessness, economic crime and hopelessness.
<p>
How much of a problem is it to determine why the U.S., the 
richest country in the world, has more than 30 million people 
living in poverty?  Could this be more complicated than landing a 
man on the moon and then to return him safely to earth?  Could it 
be more complicated than to build the necessary technology to 
produce plenty in the first place?  How many people are asking 
their leaders for an explanation for this?  Are none of the 
thousands of citizens working with charitable organizations 
interested in finding out?  Where is the school which provides 
classroom instruction concerning the requirements necessary for 
the distribution of the abundance North American technology can 
produce? Does the person who calls himself the "educational" 
president suggest forming a committee of educational experts to 
study the requirements for the operation of a high energy society?  
Who is responsible for the education of North Americans anyway?
<p>
"IF" is sometimes a very large and important word.  IF the U.S. 
and Canada had been able to select an intelligent leadership some 
60 years ago, most of the social, economic and environmental 
problems of these two countries would have been solved before now.  
IF scientific solutions then available had been used, IF they had 
not been censored out of the press, IF the citizens of this 
Continent had been taught to accept factual information as being 
more important, more accurate than beliefs and opinions, IF 
society as a whole had been more intelligent, we could now be 
learning to live rather than lying, cheating, and scrambling for 
money to buy the necessities of life.  And, IF bullfrogs had wings 
....  However, as much as we may like to look back (rather 
than forward) to find someone to blame for our troubles, the past 
really is past and, like the oil we have burned, is gone.  The 
problem now is where do we go from here?
<p>
Mankind has lived with a system of scarcity throughout their entire 
history; they had no other choice in the matter since they simply 
didn't have the technology or the know-how to provide the needs of 
all citizens.  Now, mankind has the technology of North America, 
but still does not have the know-how that allows the use of it.  
This whole system of price, of trade and commerce, of commodity 
valuation, the entire financial system of banking, the S&Ls, 
insurance, the stock market, public and private methods of 
financing physical operations, all are based on ox-cart age 
institutions that were created in times past to regulate a society 
of low energy and slow economic activity.  None of these will be 
needed, or will have any place in a system of abundance.  In fact 
the very existence of those institutions are an interference to 
the progression into a functional society.  One can't buy, sell, 
or trade commodities which are abundant, whether they be made by 
nature (consider the air we breathe) or if they are made by  
technology.  That is why we buy up farm products to keep them off 
the market; that is why we pay farmers to produce less, and that 
is why we waste natural resources in the production of products 
designed to wear out quickly.  That is why we sell, or give away 
much of our production to foreign countries.  We do these things 
to keep prices up to maintain a Price System.  We do these things 
because we, as a people, have been unwilling, or unable, to make 
the effort to understand the requirements of an age of plenty.  
And we haven't had a leadership which could furnish the answers.
<p>
The benefits of an age of plenty should be obvious and would be 
many; there would be no point to many of the legal, or illegal 
activities now perpetrated for economic gain.  About 95 percent of all
crime would be automatically eliminated. There would be no poverty;
wars would no longer be profitable and therefore would be highly
unlikely. Unemployment wouldn't exist and working hours could be
reduced as efficiency increased. Living standards would be the highest
ever known with the production of plenty for all, rather than
according to the amount of money one has. In fact, money couldn't be
used in a condition of plenty, because it must be kept scarce in order
to have value.  The changes required would 
be many and would probably provide the most exciting advance in 
human history.  But, in the meantime, the citizens of North 
America must overcome many of the misconceptions they have been 
brainwashed with for thousands of years.  This will not be easy, 
but if we are to advance into the future, improving our society as 
we go, it will be necessary.  Otherwise, human progress has about 
come to an end.
<p>
The scientific method has already solved the problems of 
production on this Continent, and it has also solved the problems 
of the distribution of plenty, and Technocracy is the result of 
scientific investigations in this field.  Technocracy was 
incorporated in the state of New York in 1933.  The Organization 
was designed to assist the citizens of North America in 
understanding the physical requirements of human progress and 
survival.  This information wasn't censored out of the press 
because it was incorrect; instead, it was censored out in an 
attempt to maintain the institutions of scarcity.  From the 
beginning, Technocracy has stated that this Price System must be 
replaced to ensure human survival, and in spite of the many efforts 
to eliminate Technocracy, it is still here.  Technocracy's 
information is essential if there is to be any beneficial future 
for this Continent and it's people.  Technocracy doesn't ask 
anyone to believe what it says; it asks that it be investigated 
and understood.  Citizens need to consider themselves part of this 
society and take responsibility for its direction and purpose.
