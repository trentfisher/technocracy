<p>
No one ever said being a Technocrat would be easy, particularly 
when attempting to present Technocracy's program for a 
technological social design to a group of environmentalists who 
are, justifiably, more apt to think of technology in terms of the 
buzz of chain saws and outpourings of hazardous waste.  After all, 
up to the present, the misuse of technology to satisfy the demands 
of a resource-hungry monetary system can realistically be blamed 
for much of the environmental degradation we are witnessing.
<p>
But let's think about the upside of technology, the application of 
science to industry, for a moment.  Technology is, like it or not, 
the inevitable means for dealing with the needs of increasing 
population.  Through technology, not-withstanding the destruction 
to the planet, we are enjoying a life-style unparalleled in 
history.  We're living longer, producing more food (even though we 
destroy horrendous amounts of it to keep the prices up), curing 
diseases, reaching for the stars.  And, in the process, we have 
brought about a state of affairs that demands a total re-alignment 
of thought when considering our Earth, our use of it, and our roles as
citizens of a civilized society.
<p>
Since the introduction of the steam engine to industry, as Americans
have pillaged, plundered and profited their way across the continent,
a change has been taking place, something unprecedented in
history. Man-hours was for so many centuries the primary means of
production and was the only means by which the majority of people
received consuming power. And this was in the form of wages that were
irreversibly being replaced by machine-hours.  Statistics show that
employment in the productive sector,
measured in terms of man-hours per unit of production, peaked in 
the mid-1920s, and has been steadily declining ever since.  At the 
same time, through automation, the flow of goods was increasing.  
This presented the unsettling situation of too many goods with not 
enough consuming power.
<p>
This "curse of abundance" had the effect of devaluing the goods; 
this may be seen by comparing the two facts:  that air is free 
while the Mona Lisa is valued at hundreds of millions of dollars --
abundance destroys value, while scarcity creates it.
Additionally, the distribution system of commodity valuation that 
Technocracy calls the Price System, is based on the premise of 
measuring resource in terms of a non-measurable medium of exchange 
that expands and contracts according to human opinion.  It is for 
this reason that we are witnessing the degradation of much of our 
planet, as we trade off tangible resource for non-real dollars.
<p>
It was questioning the significance of this progression of events 
that gave rise to the research team called the Technical Alliance 
in 1919, and its successor, the membership organization called 
Technocracy Inc. in 1933, whose purpose is to continue the 
research started by those technical experts, and to make known to 
the public at large its findings and its plan for a Technocratic 
society, a functional governance of production and distribution of 
abundance through science. So it may be said that there are two 
Technocracies:  the design, and the organization.
<p>
Environmental groups invariably look to political figures and 
processes to harmonize the interaction of self-serving man and 
uncompromising nature.  Such measures are doomed to failure, as 
are all attempts to govern physical science by means of the
non-realities of opinion and desire.
<p>
No gaggle of political figures, movie stars or astronauts, can 
come close to the galaxy of technical experts that came together 
under the directorship of Howard Scott in the Technical Alliance.  
Electrical wizard Charles Steinmetz, economist Thorstein Veblen, 
and forester Benton McKaye were among the luminaries who met to 
study the phenomenon of social change wrought by technology, the 
most cataclysmic turn of events in the history of mankind since 
the introduction of agriculture.  The progress of this process may 
be seen in Technocracy's three-curve chart, which is presented as 
a base for an understanding of these physical changes.  The extent 
of this process is yet to be understood by politicians and 
financiers who look to the vanishing past for direction.
<p>
This is not to say that all politicians are bad.  They're just 
impotent.  Some of them do the best they can within the narrow 
parameters business and special interest committees allow them.  
But very few can be relied upon to fly a 747 or fix a toaster.  
These are technical matters, best handled by people who are 
trained in the fields they are dealing with.
<p>
And so, as Technocracy finds, the increasing array of problems, 
social and environmental, that confront North America today, the 
majority of them due to the fact that we simply refuse to change 
our methodology in accordance with our changing times.  
Technocracy states that, technically speaking, there is no reason 
that these problems must exist in a land that has the resources, 
the technology, and the trained personnel to provide every citizen 
with an optimum standard of living, with a minimum of personal 
effort and minimum wastage of resource.  But finance and politics 
are techniques of the past that are clung to fanatically, 
preventing an intelligent social decision.
<p>
A technologist deals with problem and solution.  Business steps in 
and starts weighing profit margins.  Politicians step in and start 
counting votes.  Hence, compromise, half-measures, and an 
interminable series of expensive band-aids.
<p>
What all this boils down to is that we have raped the planet 
primarily to support the demands of an inefficient social system.  
And now, judging by recent developments, that is in no enviable 
state.  We are approaching a crisis point at which we will simply 
not be able to pay the price business demands in exchange for 
saving us from the mess it has created.
<p>
So where do we go from here?  This is where Technocracy comes in.
<p>
There are certain measures we must take to ensure our survival, 
measures that are not considered in our present mode of operation; 
and are not likely to be, since there is not sufficient potential for
profit. Technocracy says that these measures must be enacted, and
enacted soon, if we are to continue as an advanced civilization.
<p>
Some of these measures are: an integrated, energy-efficient
continental mass-transit system; a continental hydrology network, to
serve as a main avenue of low-energy transportation and to provide
hydro-electric power; conservation of non-renewable resources
(something that will never happen in a system that
profits by the manufacture of throw-away goods), clean water and 
air, energy, food, clothing, shelter, and medical care for the 
total population; population control without the fear and 
repression caused by ignorance; centralized city centers; and, 
above all, the opportunity to be all we can be as a civilization, 
without fear for our futures, individually and as a society.
<p>
Every one of these necessary measures is incorporated into 
Technocracy's design for abundance through the application of 
science to the social structure.  It is a comprehensive plan for 
the functional operation of the physical plant of North America by 
trained personnel, devoid of the limiting factors of politics and 
finance, and in accord with resources available for conversion to 
human use.  Production would be operated on a full-load, 24-hour 
basis, and geared to consumption.  There would be no excess 
production of goods -- a dynamic equilibrium between production 
and distribution.  Goods would be built for function and 
durability, thus eliminating the production of throw-away goods 
and the necessity for storing the overage.
<p>
Rather than the overload on facilities we presently have in our 
current work-week, weekend schedule, a new calendar would 
facilitate balancing the load on all functions of the continent, 
both productive and recreational.  Leisure time with what it takes 
to enjoy it would be usual.
<p>
To distribute goods, our current haphazard, inequitable monetary 
system
would be replaced by a method of distribution based on 
energy.  This would guarantee each individual equal consuming 
power, in terms of tangible resource and energy, from birth to 
death.  No one could cheat or rob anyone else of their consuming 
power.  With the incentive of money removed, there would be no 
more money-related crime, which now accounts for over 90% of all 
crime.
<p>
Where personal achievement is concerned, there would be no more 
demoralizing, resource-wasting competition for status through 
acquisition.  One's social status would be based on personal 
achievement and contribution.
<p>
Technocracy states that the above conditions are not empty Utopian 
promises.  These are possibilities -- necessities if we hope to 
survive as an advanced civilization.  We stand on the threshold of 
being able to eliminate the social thinking of thousands of years 
of wars, poverty, deprivation, pollution and crime -- of ensuring 
the prosperity and freedom from toil that man has envisioned since 
he first realized that he could be more than a dray beast.
<p>
Compare this with what we have now -- working our fool heads off 
in fear and uncertainty, for no other purpose than to support a 
financial system that will always demand more and return less.
<p>
Isn't it time you explored Technocracy?
