Education "is a process, not substance."  Education is a process 
of learning, or a method for helping others to learn.  It is a 
process which quite often uses language as a means of 
communication.  And, of course, language is composed of words 
which are, according to the 3rd postulate of science, symbols in 
the mind which refer to things and events in the external world.  
Since words themselves are only symbols, not the real things or 
events they refer to, they must be defined and the definitions 
understood by all parties concerned for accurate communications to 
occur.  Let us define the word, "definition":  it is an agreement, 
wholly arbitrary in character, among men as to what a word symbol 
shall refer to in the physical world.  (This agreement differs 
with different languages).  Words which don't refer to a thing or 
event in the physical world can't have a definite definition.
<p>
In order for the educational process to be effective, the student 
must make an effort to understand that the "mind" can entertain 
word symbols which do not refer to anything in the physical world, 
but rather to imaginary concepts so, therefore, misinformation can 
be a result.  The difference between fact and fiction can be more 
easily understood if one learns to accept facts as a criteria of 
truth.  A fact is a close agreement of a series of careful 
observations, or measurements, of the same phenomenon, while 
fiction is all those "things" which cannot be observed or 
measured.  Many things may, or may not be true, but none are 
facts, nor can they be proven to be real, unless they can be 
observed and measured.  Intelligence is the ability to accept 
facts as a criteria of determining what is real, what actually 
exists.  It is the ability to withhold judgement until facts are 
obtained, and further, it is the ability to correlate, to 
coordinate, those facts into a unified "picture" for the purpose 
of reaching accurate conclusions.
<p>
Now, in view of the above, what is a government; and what is its 
purpose?  What is an economic system and how does one measure the 
price of a 10 pound bag of potatoes?  Why should North Americans 
assume that patriotism to one's government and to their country is 
one and the same thing?  And why should the U.S. have 30 million 
people living in poverty when it has all the physical requirements 
to produce plenty for all?
<p>
Any country which is so mixed up mentally that it allows 30 
million of its own citizens to live in poverty, many homeless and 
hungry, and has twice that number only slightly better off when it 
has all the physical requirements for the production of plenty for 
all, doesn't have much of a leadership, and it doesn't have much 
of an educational system.  On the basis of factual information, 
can anyone deny this?
<p>
Technocracy Inc. has been working on these problems for more than 
a half century and it's efforts have been censored out of the 
press all these years.  Has any nation of people ever been kept so 
ignorant for so long for no intelligent reason?
