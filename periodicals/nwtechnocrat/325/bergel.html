<p>
We have an economy dependent upon war and the preparations for war 
-- all financed by an ever larger debt.  It has become a 
juggernaut beyond control, and resistance to control becomes more 
obdurate and idiotic.  Meanwhile, there is not much time left for 
understanding that the basic economic system must now be 
reconstructed; now become a dangerous diversion from the real problems.
<p>
The crucial need right now is to eliminate the illusions that 
dominate our national thinking.  There are several popular 
misconceptions:
<ol>
  <li>That social systems must be preserved, even when they no 
      longer work.
  <li>That it is people that must be changed, not social systems.
  <li>That wars are won by nations.  We defeated Hitler, but we 
      have nazis, fascists and others who think like them, all over our 
      nation, so, what did we win?
  <li>That we live in a democracy.  Even those who run the nation 
      do not believe that.  They say we live in a republic, and hire 
      other people to do our thinking for us.  (We actually live in a 
      plutocracy.  Look it up.)
  <li>One of the worst illusions we have is that human behaviour 
      is human nature.  Understanding the difference is important.
</ol>
<p>
There are a few more illusions we live with and by.  All in all 
they are killers, and they even kill whose who create the 
illusions for others.  The ceators probably do not realize this 
yet.
<p>
Finally, while all this goes on and we head in the direction of 
social and economic chaos, Technocracy states that it is Our 
Country Right Or Wrong.  Technocrats support it in any emergency.  
It is all we have, so we had better get about the business of 
making it right -- and soon.  Technocrats can show the way to 
understanding and the solution.  Read about Technocracy's 
Technological Social Design; it is scientifically correct and 
explains the problem and the solution.
