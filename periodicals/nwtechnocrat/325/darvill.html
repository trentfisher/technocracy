... Next year's U.S. Federal Deficit is expected to be at a record 
high.  The previous record was in 1986, $221 billion.  Next year's 
deficit is expected to hit $350 billion.  The current gross 
Federal Debt for the U.S. is $4 trillion, 78% of which has been 
accumulated since 1980; this means that the Federal Debt per 
person is $16,215.  Some of the reasons for this record deficit 
are: $30 billion to help bail out ailing financial institutions; 
and the cost of Desert Storm, $61 billion.  These are the figures 
as they stand at present; who knows what lies ahead?  How much 
money will go to newly "liberated" Baltic States, and other 
"freedom" seeking former members of the U.S.S.R. -- not to mention 
what remains of the U.S.S.R. plus whatever other causes our 
political leaders consider it expedient to support?
<p>
... In 1990 something in excess of 60,000 businesses went 
bankrupt; this is an increase of 20% over 1989.  One of the worst 
hit areas was New York City where there were 704 bankruptcies, an 
increase of 468% over 1989.  On the other side of the country, in 
San Diego, there were 478; which was an increase of 113% over the 
previous year.  Mounting deficits, increasing bankruptcies, the 
loss of more and more jobs, decaying infrastructure, an eroding 
competitive edge -- how long before they reach into the hat and 
there are no more bunnies?
<p>
... It was once a major part of the American Dream to own your own 
home, but that dream is rapidly turning into a nightmare.  In a 
recent Census Bureau study, it was revealed that 57% of all 
families are unable to buy a median priced home in their community 
and that 91% of renters cannot afford to buy a home.  As time goes 
by, many more aspects of the American Dream will begin to crumble, 
and the nightmare aspects will loom ever larger.  The nightmare 
can be relieved by waking up to the realities of the situation, 
taking steps to understand what is happening, and to then take a 
stand for a more positive future.
<p>
... The increasing efficiency of modern technology means that 
modern labour saving devices will be installed that enable more 
work to be done with fewer employees, and that the cost of the new 
equipment will be amortized over a shorter period of time.  Until 
recently, the trend was for the service industries to take up the 
slack in employment.  In the 1980s, they added 20.5 million jobs 
to the economy.  Since this current recession began, however, 
service industries, which account for 75% of all jobs, have 
trimmed their workforces by 300,000.  As a result of the 
aforementioned improvements in technology, many of them have gone 
for good.
<p>
... "Water, water everywhere but not a drop to drink."  This old 
adage may soon take on an ominous meaning.  In early summer, the 
agricultural areas of this Continent have had their rivers and 
streams laced with high levels of pesticides.  In the U.S.A., one 
in six people drink water with excessive amounts of lead, a metal 
which impairs the IQs and attention spans of children.  Microbes 
in tap water are thought to be responsible for 1 in 3 cases of 
gastrointestinal illness.  Even the chlorine placed in water to 
disinfect it produces carcinogenic compounds when combined with 
other substances in water.  Also hazardous are the toxic 
substances seeping into water from various toxic dumps, the seepage
from sewage, from overburdened or inadequate plants, leaking
underground storage tanks, and contaminants from many sources that are
allowed to penetrate into our various water systems that are already
low in quantity and rapidly becoming of dubious quality.
<p>
... The trend toward chaos becomes daily more apparent to those 
who take the trouble to look.  There is a breakdown in education, 
in health care, in housing; and the numbers of people living in 
poverty grows; this includes children.  Traffic has become more 
chaotic, both on the ground and in the air.  Pollution and 
environmental degradation have become serious.  And, even more to 
the point, the inability of our politicians and business leaders 
to cope with these problems is more pronounced.  As noted earlier, 
we must awaken to the nature of the problem, which is the 
inability of a system that is based on monetary concepts to deal 
with the problems of a technological age.  The only thing standing 
in the way of solutions to our myriad problems is money; remove it 
and  all else that is needed to arrive at solutions to most social 
problems is in place.  Investigate the possibilities; contact the 
nearest branch of Technocracy and see what the organization has to 
offer.
