The following article was printed in the periodical `Rochester
Commerce' of February 18, 1935. Its correctness has been emphasized by
the events of the past three years. It provides further proof of the
accuracy of Technocracy's analysis of our Continental problem. Read
it. Take another good look at the current American scene. Then hunt up
the nearest Technocrat and find out what `The Technocrats of
Yesteryear' are doing today! -- Editor.

<hr>
<P>
The Technocrats of yesteryear did not spring into existence
coincidently with Columbia University's press release regarding them;
neither did they cease to exist when the powers-that-be decided that
the Technocrats were not the innocuous academicians they had at first
been mistaken to be, and that henceforth the less said about them the
better.
<P>
The Technocrats of yesteryear were saying:
<P>
That the industrial employment in the United States had reached
an all-time peak in 1919 and had, been fluctuatingly declining ever
since, while production, in the meantime, was increasing, and did not
reach its peak until 1929.  Such was the rate of technological advance,
they were saving, that if 1929 production were resumed with 1929
hours of labor there would still be a standing army, of about 12 million
unemployed, and that the, growth trends were such that the number of
man-hours per annum required by industry would continue to decrease
into the indefinite future.
<P>
They were saying further:
<P>
That, under a Price System control, the existing industrial mechanism
could not be kept in operation except through the continued
creation of debt for the purpose of providing the requisite purchasing
power to enable the public to buy the goods produced.
<P>
That the debt structure itself was premised upon the maintenance
of a compound-interest rate of expansion which could only be
maintained without dilution through inflation provided industrial
production were maintained at a similar rate of compound increment.
<P>
That since about 1915 the mean growth curve of industrial production
had been progressively flattening while the debt structure had 
continued in the meantime to go merrily upward at a rate of increase
of 5% or more per annum, and that such a discrepancy would lead
ultimately to a complete break-down of the debt situation, or else if
its expansion were halted, drive the interest rate to zero, with the
resulting disruption of the functions of banking, insurance, and other
such purely financial institutions, as well as to the undermining of
universities, museums, hospitals, and other endowed institutions.
<P>
That when business men found it no longer profitable to indulge
in the process of further debt creation, it would become necessary for
their government to do it for them.
<P>
And that the <em>status quo</em>, financial and political, would go from one
futile gesture to another (witness the N. R. A., C. C. C., Liberty
League, Economy League, etc.) by the the use of purely palliative
measures designed to postpone the inevitable facing of the real issues
involved, fooling the public all the while by typical Kerensky tactics of
camouflaging reactionary measures behind radical terminology.
<P>
<H3>The Technocrats of Today</H3>
<P>
The Technocrats of today are watching with a certain grim satisfaction
the fulfillment of these prophesies.
<P>
The army of the unemployed has not been more than slightly decreased
and is again on the increase.  Industrial production has not
been more than slightly revived by governmental priming of the pump
to the tune of more than four billion dollars per annum. The relief
rolls, as is to be expected, are mounting at an alarming rate until there
are now approximately 2O million people depending on federal relief
alone. Add to this the 3.5 million people regularly employed by the
federal government, together with their families: totaling some 15
millions of people and we have 35 million people depending for their
livelihood upon the federal government.
<P>
The interest rate is approaching zero. The federal government
has become the principal assumor of new debts. This function of
government creation of debt, it might be added, to the extent of 4
billion dollars or more per year is for the purpose of making up the
deficit in purchasing power resulting from current industrial operation by
private business. Were this functional not performed by the government
but left to private business and private initiative the current
purchasing power would be about 4 billion dollars per annum short
of enough to buy a year's output of goods and services and industrial
production would go down like a house of cards.
<P>
The Technocrats of yesteryear were not proposing a solution for the
reason that the crying need of the hour on the part of the American
public was to become familiar with the pertinent pacts of the existing
social situation, and above all to rid themselves of a fixed faith in
an economic Santa Claus.
<P>
<H3>Technocracy's Solution</H3>
<P>
Now that the American public have incorporated into their thinking a
large amount of factual material of which two years ago they
were unaware, the Technocrats of today propose a solution:
<P>
They propose to so operate the industry of the North American
Continent as to provide for <strong>every</strong> inhabitant of that
area complete
economic security at the highest standard of living attainable that is
compatible with social needs, on the one hand, and with the necessity
of conserving limited natural resources, on the other.
<P>
Since drudgerous occupation at long hours of labor is socially
objectionable, they propose to do all this by means as automatic as
can be devised.
<P>
They propose to achieve the highest standard of public health
attainable through the most advantageous application of modern
scientific medical knowledge and research.
<P>
They propose to maintain an educational system that will train the
entire younger generation indiscriminately as regards all factors other
than inherent ability, to man and perform all the necessary functions
in the social mechanism.
<P>
To do all this requires that society be organized along functional,
technological lines in a manner dictated by the requirements of the
job itself. The present operating and technical staffs (as opposed to
the financial superstructure) of such large functional units as the
telephone system, the power system, etc., may be taken to serve as small
scale models of what is here envisaged on a large scale. The social
organization here considered would embrace the whole range of socially
necessary functions, the purely social such as education, public
health, entertainment, etc., as well as the industrial functional sequences.
<P>
To insure the continuous operation of industry at full-load capacity,
and to maintain the high standard of living, postulated requires a
mechanism that will distribute the goods to the public at a rate equal
to that of industrial production.  Such a mechanism is to be found in
the physical cost of production, namely, the energy expended in the
production of each item of goods and services.
<P>
If, in a given year, a certain sum total of energy (equivalent to
that contained in a given number of tons of coal) be ear-marked for
expenditure in the production of goods and services, this-energy cost
can be allocated item by item, to each of the goods and services
produced.  A purchasing power likewise stated in denominations of
energy (kilowatt-hours, calories, etc.) can be issued to the public in
an amount per annum equal to the energy allotment ear-marked for
expenditure in that time period.
<P>
This energy income can be granted to the public in the form of
energy certificates which are valid only for the time period for which
they are issued and null and void thereafter. They have the further
property of being non-interchangeable between individuals. Thus
one's income cannot be saved; neither can it be lost, stolen, given or
gambled away. It can only be spent by the person to whom issued.
There is no necessity that the recipient spend the entire amount he
receives provided, as might well be the case, he finds it inconvenient
to do so. All incomes continue without interruption until the death
of the recipient.
<P>
<H3>Since all incomes can be made large there is no need for</H3>
differentiation between the amounts received by different individuals and
moreover there are distinct advantages in not doing so.  Hence, all
adult incomes, male and female alike, are to be made equal. The
Technate accordingly renders it impossible for any of its citizens to
enjoy poverty or economic insecurity. The working day would be
made a minimum probably not in excess of 4 hours per day for 20
years of one's lifetime.
<P>
Such is the barest possible outline of Technocracy's blueprint.
The implications, social and technical, are many and far-reaching. On
the social side, crime, war, poverty, disease and ignorance would
largely be abolished; on the technical side, the present junk which we
call our industrial equipment and our housing would be replaced by the
best that modern science and technology can design and produce.
<P>
The Technocrats of tomorrow are expected to make the installation.
