In 1951 Robert C. Cook wrote a book titled, <em>Human Fertility:
the modern dilemma,</em> published by William Sloane Associates
of New York. At that time he was Director of the Population
Research Bureau, Inc. in Washington, D.C. and publisher of the
<cite>Population Bulletin.</cite>
<p>
<em>"Uncontrolled Fertility is bringing all humanity to the
brink of disaster,</em> warned Mr. Cook. <em>"Unbalanced and
unchecked fertility is ravaging many lands like a hurricane or a
tidal wave. The scramble for bare subsistence by hordes of
hungry people is tearing the fertile earth from the hillsides,
destroying forests, and plunging millions of human beings into
utter misery."</em>
<p>
He explained how the intelligence of our population declines as
the most ignorant types of humanity are breeding the fastest,
while the superior types are not replacing themselves. He
pointed out that there was a time when only thetoughest
individuals could survive; now, with our science and our
humanitarianism, we make it easy for the unfit to survive and
multiply and, thereby, we are bringing all humanity to the brink
of disaster.
<p>
He used the island of Puerto Rico as a problem example on a
small scale of a population that had outbred the means for its
survival. He saw it as foreshadowing the eventual fate of the
world: ``When landed on Puerto Rico, the island was
a 'tropical paradise' inhabited by a few
Indians. Some of these were lucky enough to escape into the
hills and survive the introduction of Spanish 
culture that followed; but, for the most part, the island became
populated with the dregs of Spain and slaves from Africa. Under
the brutality and ruthless exploitation of the Spanish noblemen
and a medieval church, the population became stabilized at the
saturation point of about one million, living under one of the
world's worst tropical slum conditions.
<p>
``In the year 1898, the United States wrested Puerto Rico from
Spain and proceeded to apply the benefits of health and
sanitation and other humanitarian techniques. One of the world's
most civilized nations, thus, set out to show the world what it
could do for a limited, backward area and its miserable
inhabitants. After a net loss of some one billion dollars to the
American taxpayers and a half century of benevolent
humanitarianism, Puerto Rico had a population of 2.2 million in
1951 3.2 million by 1981 census and 3.7 million by 1992], with
most of its inhabitants living in poverty, debasement, and
filth; and it was still held in a state of intolerable
superstition by the same medieval church, which continued to
leach all it could get from the miserable incomes of its people.
The area was not self-supporting. The luxuriant vegetation was
gone; the birds sang no more; and many thousands of acres of
once fertile soil were eroded beyond use.
<p>
``Then, the birthrate of Puerto Rico was one of the highest in
the world, with birth control fiendishly opposed by the Roman
Catholic hierarchy and the American political machine. The only
alleviation of this condition came fromPuerto Rico's ability to
slop hundreds of thousands of its wretched, unwanted people into
the slums of East Harlem, New York, where they
added to, and made worse, the congestion and poverty of that
already overcrowded and miserable district, and
where they added appreciably to the crime problem of the city.''
<p>
Today, the dire problems of overpopulation haven't
changed except to increase in scope and intensity. Anthony
Lewis, writing for the New York Times in February of 1993 said:
"Bangladesh has a land area smaller than Wisconsin--and
a population of 114 million. Its numbers are growing so fast
that by the year 2025 it will outstrip the present U.S.
population of 250 million."
<p>
The number one worry over what will happen to these
people seems to be if science could produce enough food to feed
them, where would they find the jobs needed to buy it. Does this
make sense? We don't feed people unless they have money, and to
have money they must have jobs? When jobs, like the dinosaurs,
are becoming extinct due to scientific discoveries and
automation and overpopulation? The mayhem and destruction that
is bound to happen in the future when enough people are hungry
and have nothing left to lose will not be a pretty sight. This
violence against society has already begun, only we choose to
label it crime.
<p>
"Mexico City harbors 20 million Mexicans, many under
appalling conditions," writes Anthony Lewis.
"Half the country's people live without sewers and a
quarter without safe water. Can anyone be surprised that,
despite the country's improving economic record, many Mexicans
are desperate to get into the United States?
<p>
"Rational self-interest, not just humane concern, should
make the rich countries do all they can to prevent
overpopulation and the suffering and strife it brings. But
rationality has not been the mainspring of
American population policy lately. Presidents Reagan and Bush
shaped their policy to please the anti-abortion movement and the
Christian right.
<p>
"The Reagan administration sabotaged the world population
conference in Mexico City in 1984 by taking the
position that rapid growth was a 'neutral'
phenomenon. Since then the United States has drastically reduced
aid to population-control efforts abroad at a time when
underdeveloped countries were recognizing the need for
restraint. Michael S. Teitelbaum, writing about the policy in an
earlier issue of <em>Foreign Affairs,</em> calls it 'self-
inflicted blindness.'"
<p>
Adhering to the Bible for guidance regarding today's
social problems is like dragging out a medieval geography book
to use in a current events class today. We can no longer "be
fruitful and multiply" nor can we continue to "subdue the
earth." Yet we are doing both at an alarming rate. We find
parents, who aren't satisfied with one or two children, taking
fertility pills and coming up with multiple births, even
quintuplets; people stand outside family planning clinics
carryingplacards against family planning; anti-abortionists
continue to terrorize abortion clinics, their staff and their
patients, and now murder can be added to their unsavory deeds.
In February a doctor was shot to death outside an abortion
clinic in Pensacola,Florida by a fanatical pro-life supporter, a
strange paradox; he takes a life to prove his support of life.
If these ugly, moronic acts are allowed to continue unabated,
surely the ignorant and superstitious shall inherit the earth.
<p>
Once that fetus has been saved and grows into a person, to heck
with it. If this fully developed person is eligible for war with
its devastation and slaughter, the pro-life people are nowhere
in sight. Nor do they offer any solutions for taking care of
thousands of unwanted children. Adoption agencies are, for the
most part, more interested in how many bedrooms the adoptive
parents have than if they can give children love and
understanding, food and clothing and a roof over their heads. In
the meantime, biological children can sleep in the streets with
their homeless parents. (Since they are no longer fetuses, they
have been saved already.)
<p>
Anthony Lewis further writes: "The Earth's population
was around 1 billion in the year 1800, 2 billion in 1920, 3
billion in 1960. Today it is 5 billion. By 2025 it is expected
to be more than 8 billion, and 95 percent of the increase will
be in the Third World."
<p>
Is North America on its way to joining the Third World?
It's forests are being denuded faster than they can be replaced
by people desperate for money, for jobs, for power. Not only is
it becoming over-populated by its own citizens, but the influx
of immigrants threatens to overwhelm what resources are left.
All immigrants need to do to get into the U.S. is claim
political asylum. Once they get past the immigration checkpoint,
they can become absorbed by the masses and disappear. The U.S.
Government will go to any lengths to convert aliens to the cause
of democracy, which it doesn't practice itself. And if the
aliens are rich, or if they can provide cheap labor, all the
better.
<p>
"Only four years ago the Census Bureau
projected that the U.S. population would peak at 304 million in
2038 and then decline. But that was before the Census Bureau
recognized that fertility rates are likely to rise, before the
Immigration Law of 1990 was passed, and before life expectancy
projections were increased. Even if the Census
Bureau's middle projection is correct,
America's population will probablygrow by at least another 150
million people within the next 60 years.
<p>
"Some demographers remain critical of the Bureau's projections,
such as Dennis Ahlburg and James Vaupel, authors of
<em>Alternative Projections of U.S. Population.</em> They
believe that future baby boom/bust cycles are more probable,
life expectancy and fertility rates are likely
to rise even higher, and pressure to accept more immigrants as
world population grows could be greater than the Census Bureau
has estimated and that therefore the Bureau's projections may
still be too low. Their research supports the conclusion that if
we allow current demographic trends to continue, we will likely
have approximately 500 million Americans by 2050. Anyone
concerned about the future of this country should consider what
the optimum population size of the United States might be, since
population growth affects every public policy issue, including
what the <em>Center for Immigration Studies </em>calls 'the
three E's--economy, education, and the environment.'"
<p>
(The above two paragraphs were excerpted from <em>Carrying
Capacity Network, </em>March, 1993 issue.)
<p>
Robert C. Cook thought that if the people became
conscious of the need for birth control, they would override
tradition and church opposition. That was over 40 years ago. We
can see what happenswhen we leave serious social problems up to
the people to vote on; these problems grow more intense. The
intelligent are recognizing the over-population catastrophe. The
ignorant and superstitious are not, a truly formidable outlook
for future generations.
<p>
As one sage remarked: <em>"If we fail to recognize the
problem, it may happen, there will one day be none of us left,
not even any to bury the dead."</em>
