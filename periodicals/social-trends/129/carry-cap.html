don't want or can't feed or educate, give that child to me.&quot;</i>

<p>
It is estimated that hunger has already become a worldwide problem
with about 1 in 5, or 20 percent of the world's population going
without sufficient nourishment to sustain life.
<p>
The world's population, now at 5.6 billion, is likely to reach 8.5
billion by the year 2025 and 10 billion by 2050.  While all continents
are showing an increase in population, most of the growth is occurring
in those areas of the world with <i>developing </i>and
<i>underdeveloped</i> countries, which  are among the poorest of
nations.
<p>
It would take gargantuan measures to control and reduce the
population growth that is taking place in the world today.  Those
vested interests that include businesses, politicians, and
ecclesiastical organizations and groups (the vanguard of the status
quo) are not making the task any easier.  Regardless, when considering
that the resources of this one
and only earth are finite (and rapidly being depleted), nations have
no other alternative except to take those  measures that will stem
population growth.  Otherwise, physical factors and limitations will
do it for them.  The consequences of not doing anything would be
catastrophic.
