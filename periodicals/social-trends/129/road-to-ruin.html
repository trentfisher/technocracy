<p>
Technocracy has always insisted that the type of social operation it
offers is not just desirable;  it is necessary.  Humankind can not
continue to live at all on this Continent without drastically changing
their methods of management.
<p>
During 98 percent of humankind's 7000 years of civilized existence on
the earth, their technological progress was so slow that the
disturbance of the general ecological balance was only of a minor
consequence and only local in its effects.  But the last two percent
of that time - about the last 150 years - tells a far different story.
During this time, humankind has become a plague upon the earth.  They
have exterminated or exhausted many species that once roamed the
earth, flew the sky, or swam the waters by the hundreds of
millions. They have plowed up the sod and slashed away at the plant
growth, until many areas that were once verdant with forests and grass
are now desolate.  The ecological environment in which humankind as a
species could flourish is now shrinking because of their own careless
behavior.
<p>
Humankind has also let their population increase to the point where it
has become self-destructive.  They must not only combat the other
elements of the environment in order to survive, but they must battle
within their own species to determine which individuals and which
groups are to survive.  No matter how one tries to rationalize the
value of human life, one cannot escape the conclusion that there are
just too many human beings on the earth.
<p>
As a result of this overburden of human population, the destruction of
forests and other organic life that is consumed in the processes of
human living is in many instances greater than the replacement of the
particular species involved.  Overgrazing of the rangelands in the
western United States, for example, has so reduced the edible plants
and so eroded the soil that the rangelands will not support more than
a fraction of the livestock that they did 60 or more years ago.  The
people of North America are cutting off the forests faster than they
are being replenished.  Even certain species of life in the ocean are
becoming exhausted, not only the great whales, but certain species of
shellfish and true fishes used for food.
<p>
It is not these organic factors of the environment alone that are
being disturbed by humankind's recent activities on the earth, but the
disturbance extends into the inorganic elements as well.  Among these
is ground water.  Through millions of years, the rocks of the earth
have been saturated with water below a certain level.  This level is
known as the water table.  Humankind has disturbed this ground in a
great many places. They have instituted drainage to remove surplus
water from the surface, which has resulted in a lowering of the water
table.  They have destroyed the plant cover in many places and this
permits a more rapid runoff, hence less water seeps into the
ground. They have drilled wells and pumped the water out of the ground
at a faster rate than it is replaced by natural means.  They have
diverted many lakes, streams and underground flows into the water
mains of their large cities and then increased the population of the
cities beyond the capacities of the water to supply their needs.
Thus, in many areas where there was adequate water to supply a
moderate population on a long-term basis, there is now a deficiency of
water because of the uncontrolled increase of the population and the
shortsighted exploitation of the water resources.
<p>
Another inorganic factor that humankind is misusing is the arable soil
of the earth.  America has already lost over half of its top soil and
continues to lose 2 million acres of its farmland to development every
year.  Moreover, the U.S. loses an additional 3 billion tons of rich
and irreplaceable top soil each year through wind and water erosion.
Alternating between years of drought and floods, and with the
incessant soil erosion, America's farms are faced with an uncertain
future.
<p>
But these are not the most critical factors affecting humankind's
ecological balance.  During their industrial growth, accompanied by
the wasteful practices of business exploitation, they have become
ravenous in the use of many minerals, ranging from iron ore to
phosphate fertilizers.  A number of the most critical of these
minerals are nearing the stage of deficiency and some are rapidly
approaching exhaustion.  For example, the United States can no longer
supply all of its own present consumption of copper, lead, zinc,
tungsten, manganese, and petroleum.  The United States is importing
all of these to meet its domestic demands.  Iron ore will soon be
added to this list if it has not been added already.
<p>
It is of little moment, in the long run, whether the human species on
this Continent can maintain its present industrial pace for another
ten years or another hundred.  In reviewing the over-all picture, we
have neglected the details that support the general conclusions, but
the details are there in abundance.
<p>
The important thing we are attempting here is a long-range projection
of humankind's ecological trend, especially as it pertains to the
North American Continent.  This much we can say for sure:  Humankind
will not be able to live on the North American Continent for the next
generation as they have lived for the past generation.  They have been
too prodigal with their heritage.  This has left them in the position
of being repudiated by their environment.
<p>
The people of North America cannot continue  their present magnitude
of free enterprise operations for even a few more years.  The
environment will not supply the raw materials for this type of human
onslaught for long.  What the future of the people now living on the
continent will become is something fearful to contemplate.  Yet North
American citizens, instead of acknowledging the facts and recognizing
the trend, are blindly and blatantly going ahead to increase the rate of 
the very factors that are contributing most toward the downfall of
their vaunted civilization.
