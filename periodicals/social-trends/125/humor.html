The  Oregon Natural Resources Council has appealed the Siskiyou
National Forest's plan to log off an old-growth area, habitat of the
northern spotted owl, but it turns out that this project is just a
<i>meadow restoration</i> one.
<p>
&quot;They're going to clearcut 75 acres of forest and get 2 million
board feet (of timber).  That is plain and simple a timber sale,&quot;
said an ONRC staff attorney.
<p>
Not so, says the Chetco Ranger District's assistant timber manager.
&quot;The motivation for the Upper Chetco Meadow Restoration Project
is simply to rejuvenate a meadow that has become overgrown with
trees.&quot;
<p>
And then there is the Forest Service 's unproven argument that logging
will save eagles.  It is asking a federal judge to allow salvage
logging where the owls live in Oregon's Winema National Forest.
&quot;Some cutting is needed to keep bugs and disease from killing
trees with nests of bald eagles.&quot;
<p>
Government lawyers want U.S. District Judge William Dwyer in Seattle
to grant an exception to his logging injunction..  Dwyer ordered the
logging ban across millions of acres of national forests in Oregon,
Washington and northern California in May 1991, claiming that
government logging plans were violating U.S. environmental laws
protecting the owls and other wildlife.
<p>
The Forest Service  has attempted to persuade the judge to lift the
ban in the past and failed.  Their request was to be allowed to log
more than 6 million board feet of timber, mostly white fir, over about
500 acres in the Winema National Forest east
of Crater Lake., one of Oregon's most treasured environmental wonders.
&quot;We are asking to protect the valuable habitat of the threatened
northern bald eagle that likely will be destroyed unless swift
management action is taken,&quot; said a Forest Service spokeswoman.
Environmentalists say it may be a ploy to free up some timber for
harvest without protecting either bird.  
<p>
One can't help but wonder how the forests and their flora and
fauna managed to survive before institutions such as the Forest
Service were invented to protect them.
