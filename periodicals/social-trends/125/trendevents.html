<h4>JOB SUMMIT PLUMMETS</h4>
<p>
There was the usual ballyhoo about the Job Summit called by the
Clinton Administration and held in Detroit during the month of March
to find out why the industrial nations are still having their highest
unemployment rate since the not so Great Depression.
<p>
It took a long time before the leadership of the seven industrial
nations--Germany, France, Britain, Japan, Russia, Canada and the
United States--would admit and become sensitive to the seriousness of
the unemployment problem.  Many of the European leaders initially
opposed the idea of a job conference, but when unemployment became the
hottest issue in the elections of Western Europe, where there are
already 35 million people out of work, the powers-to-be had to make it
appear that they were concerned and sensitive to the plight of the
workers, so they agreed to send their ministers to the Job Summit.
<p>
Although the ministers of the seven industrial nations discussed what
to do about the ever growing unemployment problem, no new ideas or
anything of substance came out of the conference.  Yet, the
seriousness of the situation was not overlooked by some of the
participants at the Job Summit.  Dominique Moisi, deputy director of
the French Institute for International Relations said, &quot;If we
don't find answers to that problem  (unemployment), our entire system
will collapse on itself.&quot;  He added that France could face a
replay of the revolutionary events of May, 1968, but this time around
it won't be the young people bored with growth and the affluent
society who take to the barricades but young people desperate to find
a place in a system that rejects them.  (Only recently the French
government tried to lower the minimum wage for the youth of France but
was forced to rescind the edict as a result of a revolt on the part of
the young people of France.)  Western Europe has an average
unemployment rate around 11 percent with Spain topping the list at 23
percent, and the outlook is rather bleak.
<p>
Labor Secretary Robert Reich, one of the representatives of the United
States at the summit, made a pertinent point when he said, &quot;But
we have learned in recent years that the paper economy and the
people's economy are not always the same thing.&quot;  While he made
this statement in Detroit for public consumption, it does not mean the
power brokers of the beltway in Washington are going to be persuaded
or any more concerned with what happens to the millions of Americans
who are unemployed or have lost their jobs permanently.  While they
will put up a good articulated front, their mind set will continue to
be, &quot;Let them eat cake.&quot;
<p>
<h4>GOVERNMENT REINVENTS METHOD FOR DETERMINING JOBLESS</h4>
<p>
The federal government has changed the way it determines the national
unemployment rate.  But the supposedly improved method does not even
come close to giving an accurate picture of the devastating job crisis
that is becoming more entrenched.
<p>
Millions of Americans who thought they were secure in their jobs now
find themselves caught in the hideous undertow of long-term
unemployment.  The jobless go quietly.  Here today, gone tomorrow.
When enough time goes by, the government no longer counts them as
being unemployed.
<p>
It has become a scary situation with serious implications.  It's not
just the underclass of the inner-city that has become permanently
unemployed; it now includes an increasing number of the middle-class,
and even those of the white-collar professions.  No one is immune to
the massive layoffs and downsizing that is going on in industry and
business, and even in government.
<p>
According to Bob Herbert, columnist for the New York Times News
Service, in an article with the caption &quot;Counting the
jobless&quot;, the Bureau of Labor's official rates on unemployment
are much lower than the true rates.  As he points out, for example,
discouraged workers--people who have given up looking for a job--are
no longer counted as unemployed.  While the bureau will readily tell
you the number of Americans who fall into the discouraged category, it
doesn't factor the discouraged workers into the official unemployment
rate.  Before the change, the bureau counted 1.1 million discouraged
workers.  After the change, 600,000.
<p>
In his column, Herbert mentions that there are endless examples of
Americans who are out of work but not counted as unemployed.  These
former workers were considered unemployed, even when they could expect
their jobs to return.  No more.  Now laid-off means fired, not to be
rehired any time in the future.  For the thousands of workers who are
being laid off or their jobs have disappeared or  have moved overseas,
they are surely out of work, but under the bureau's changing
procedure, they are not officially counted as unemployed.
<p>
The official recorded unemployment rate for January was 6.7 percent,
but this figure only represents to a small extent the unemployment and
underemployment problem that confronts the United States.  Herbert
thinks a better indicator of the prevailing conditions would be a
statistic that showed the number of people who wanted a job but could
not find one.  He says, &quot;That number would be astonishingly
high.&quot;  In closing his article he inserts a statement from Keith
Brooks, director of the New York Unemployed Committee, who makes the
essential point:  &quot;Does our government recognize the depth of the
job crisis in this country?  I think not.&quot;
<p>
<h4>JOB CUTS MOUNT DESPITE &quot;RECOVERY&quot;</h4>
<p>
Despite  the &quot;recovery&quot; of the economy, there can be no
solace for the thousands of workers who are receiving pink slips in
the continuing rash of job-slashing.  Corporate streamlining, even as
the bottom line of business improves, does not mean that the reduction
of the work force is over by any means.
<p>
There are reports that cutbacks of the labor force are on the decline;
nevertheless, layoffs and the displacement of workers continue at a
high rate.  As the government reported hiring increases (part-time or
low-paying MacJobs?), U.S. employers laid off 192,572 workers (Tampa
Tribune 4/6/94) in the first quarter of this year, <u>the largest
first-quarter figure since 1989</u>. 
<p>
To get some idea that the reduction of America's work force is far
from over and will continue for years to come, just the figures in the
communications industry alone give a vivid picture of the deep
cutbacks that will continue in the work place.  In the first two
months of the year, GTE announced it would discharge 17,000 workers;
Nynex said it would cut 16,800; AT&amp;T also gave notice that it
would cut its work force by another 15,000; and Pacific Bell announced
a cutback of 10,000.  Even companies in the service industry, which
has not been hit nearly as hard as manufacturing, are now laying off
employees in the hundreds and thousands.
<p>
Downsizing and massive layoffs demonstrate to investors that companies
are serious in long-term profitability.  Gone are the days when
layoffs were a sign of weakness.  Now companies want to send the
message to Wall Street that they are mean and lean, and competitive.
<p>
To allow this condition to continue where financial and profitability
is the only objective, and most workers are no longer needed in the
scheme of things, who will have the wages and salaries to buy the glut
of goods and services that industry can produce? That is the question
and the crux of the matter that must be answered.  The solution to
this paradox will not be found within the framework of the present
economic system.
<p>
<h4>WHO PAYS AND BENEFITS FROM TECHNOLOGICAL &quot;PROGRESS&quot;?</h4>
<p>
If there is one thing that American workers have learned in recent
years, it's that progress under the present economic system comes at a
steep cost, and usually they are the ones who have to pay for it in
more than one way.   	While companies and business establishments
are restoring their profitability and net worth through downsizing and
installing automation, middle managers, scientists and engineers, and
other skilled workers are now pounding the streets for meaningful
kinds of jobs or work that no longer exists.
<p>
Those industries and companies that are investing most of their
capital expenditures in automation and updating their technology are
getting rid of their employees the quickest.  The communications
industry is a good example why fewer and fewer workers are needed in
this age of technology.  According to Stephen S. Roach, senior
economist of Morgan Standley &amp; Co., &quot;There have been 60,000
layoffs in telecommunications alone this year.&quot;
<p>
Just how did this massive displacement of employees come about?  When
it comes to the application of technology and the use of new materials
in telephone communications, there is little comparison between the
old method that uses copper wires and the new method that uses glass
fiber optics in the transmission of information.  Conventional
telephone cables use electricity that travels through a 3-inch cable
containing 1,200 pairs of copper wire that can carry 14,400 telephone
conversations.  But a half-inch fiber optic cable for telephone use
that includes only 72 pairs of fiber can transmit 3.5 million
conversations.
<p>
Charles Richardson, director of the Technology and Work Program at the
University of Massachusetts, says he sees plenty of evidence of
technologies that have <i>enhanced </i> <i>competitiveness while
effectively destroying lives</i>. &quot;What's the point,&quot;
Richardson asks, &quot;of having the most technologically advanced
country in the world, if no one can live in it because there are no
jobs left?&quot;
<p>
Wasn't technology supposed to liberate us? Technology liberated the
farmer for a generation or two.  Then it practically eliminated him as
the agribusiness conglomerates took over.  Technology has cut in half
the time required in some jobs and in some cases eliminated the
worker.  But instead of firms cutting the work week in half (with
adequate pay), corporations are cutting their work forces in half.
<p>                             
<h4>COMMENTS ON THE ABOVE ISSUE OF TRENDEVENTS</h4>
<p>
Without wanting to sound repetitious, it should be understood by now
that jobs per se have become an anachronism in this age of science and
technology.  It isn't the technology and scientific innovations that
are at fault for America's present job problems; it is the present
economic system that is concerned only with using our research,
development and technology for merely financial considerations and
maximizing profits.  The perpetuation of this financial and monetary
structure, or Price System, by the special-vested interests and by
what has been referred to as the <i>inner circle </i>has sabotaged the
use of technology for meaningful and exigent purposes.
<p>
This nation still has enough resources left and the agricultural and
industrial capacity to produce a high and sustainable standard of
living for every American man, woman and child.  There is no excuse
for poverty in the midst of plenty.  But this so-called market
oriented economy, which is geared to and based upon commodity
valuation and a monetary price mechanism (more concerned with
maintaining artificial scarcity), is obsolete and cannot deal with the
distribution of a glut or plethora of goods and services that are
being produced, even when the industrial capacity of the country
hovers around 80 to 83 percent.  The time for depending on jobs, wages
and salaries, investments and global dumping of surpluses to keep the
system afloat is no longer feasible, not when inundated with a glut of
goods and services.
<p>
This problem can be easily rectified--it should have been done long
ago--by implementing a scientific-measuring accounting system in which
production and distribution are brought into balance, and the
resources and technology are used (requisitioned or allocated) to meet
the necessary physical requirements of this high-energy and industrial
society and the essential needs for every American citizen.  If we do
not make a transition in this direction soon, the United States could
develop into an uncontrollable and unmanageable situation that could
bring serious consequences.
