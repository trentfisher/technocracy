A new Labor Department survey reports a growing trend of multiple jobholders
in the work force.  Today, 7 million Americans, 6 percent of the work force,
occupy 15 million jobs.  Although single mothers and divorcees are among the
total, most of the multiple jobholders are married, holding down more than one
job to make ends meet.
<p>
No other country (developed) approaches the United States, says Richard
Freeman, a Harvard labor economist.  In most other developed and industrial
nations, wages from one job are sufficient.  You would have thought that as
women entered the work force, that would have been enough additional income,
and dual jobholding would have declined, but the opposite has happened.  "Women
going to work (out of necessity) have not brought in enough income," Freeman
said.
<p>
Freeman states that since 1970, 80 percent of the nation's households have
failed to gain ground after their incomes -- mostly in wages -- were adjusted
for inflation, etc.
<p>
Here is a country that has over a $6 trillion Gross Domestic Product, can
produce more goods and services than the American people can possibly consume
(stores and shelves filled to the brim), yet with all its industrial and
technological capacity, this nation still clings to an obsolete economic system
that cannot distribute what it produces to all of the American people.  What
good is all of this so-called "technological advancement and progress" if the
American people have to work at so many jobs and so many hours just to make
ends meet.  How long must we wait before the country redirects its priorities
toward where the people can receive the benefits and the fruits of this
technology and, for a change, have more leisure time to enjoy living.
