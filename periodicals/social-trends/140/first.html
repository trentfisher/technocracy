<p>
With a great deal of interest, I have read everything in the August 8
and 22, 1994 issue of <cite>Awake </cite>magazine.  My overall
impression is that its writers are attempting to build the
now-mandatory social structure from the <u>top down</u> -- morals
first.  Physical law demands that any earthly structure be built from
the <u>ground up</u>.  Provide physical comforts first.
<p>
Any building, in order to be structurally sound, must have, first of all, a
solid base.  The superstructure then follows, and a superstructure can be only
as strong and enduring as the quality of the foundation on which it is built.
Even the most devout ministers must have shelter, clothing, food, etc., before
they go out to preach the gospel.  First things first!
<p>
One of the <cite>Awake</cite> articles states: ``Evolution diminishes
the Bible authority in the minds of many.''  One must ask why?  Is it
because a greater understanding of science has diminished that
authority?  There is much evidence to prove the theory of evolution
and, as humankind's knowledge and logical understanding of natural law
increases, ``knowing'' takes precedence over ``believing.''
<p>
<cite>Awake </cite>also says, ``Clearly, making money dominates the
thinking of many young people.'' and ``Yet, youths are merely
responding to the ethical tone set by their elders.''  The fact is
that they are doing what is required in order to succeed and survive
in a competitive, vicious social system!  People behave according to
the environment in which they find themselves, and the environment
provided by the monetary system causes the bad behavior we see all
around us today.   So -- let us get at the CAUSE of all the bad
behavior.  Remove the monetary system.  First things first!
<p>
The <cite>Awake</cite> magazine is put out by a religious organization
with a large following; therefore, it has a tremendous responsibility
regarding the future of this physical world.  If you are going to
continue training your flock that morals come first, you must take the
responsibility for a large portion of our continuing earthly ailments.
<p>
In one article, the writer speaks of ``all races living together in peace.''
The writer goes on to say, ``Scientific evidence is conclusive that all men
clearly belong to one species.''  Yes, indeed. If one wants to prove a thing,
one must rely on science.
<p>
<cite>Awake</cite> continues:  ``Satan's influence must be eliminated
in human affairs,'' then asks, ``Will these things ever happen?  Is
there any basis for believing they will?''  Then:  ``Jesus Christ
revealed how racial prejudice could be eliminated when he commanded
his followers to 'love one another' just as He loved them.''  The
writer goes on to quote from Romans 12.10:  ``In showing honor to one
another, take the lead.''
<p>
In order to survive and prosper, it is impossible to ``love one
another.''  In a dog-eat-dog environment, we must learn to eat dog
before dog eats us!  So, one answer is:  switch from a monetary system
to Energy Accounting as proposed by Technocracy.  Physical change
takes more than praying together.  It requires ACTION ``works''; not
just ``words'', or prayer.
<p>
Yes, spiritual and physical needs must be tied together. ``Every
kingdom divided against itself goes to ruin; and no town, no
household, that is divided against itself can stand'' (Matthew 12.25,
<cite>The New English Bible).</cite> The item further says it is
``beyond human effort to do so.'' The fact is that it is <u>not beyond
human effort to do so</u>!!!!  A scientific governance would rid us of
racial prejudice because we wouldn't be competing for jobs or trying,
by any method we could scheme up, to gain control of ever more money.
<p>
In one article on kidney stones, the writer states, ``But with recent
technological advances, the need for open surgical removal is rare.''
and ``...if you should have another kidney stone...there are improved
methods for treating them.''  <u>Science</u> provides these ``new
methods.'' New developments are the result of scientific study.
<p>
In writing about Nyalaland and its endangered animal population, the writer
speaks of that ``Paradise Unspoiled by Man.''  The conclusion is: ``...God will
intervene and save the earth from ruin.''  So, it seems that all we have to do
is pray?  And wait, eh?  We, the people, have made a mess of our house, earth,
so isn't it our responsibility to clean it up rather than pray and wait for an
alleged supreme being to come and do it for us?
<p>
The writers of <cite>Awake</cite> tell us what kind of social structure must be
built, but it takes a carpenter to do the constructing!  Jesus is said to have
been a carpenter; any carpenter knows that it is impossible to build a strong
and secure superstructure if you don't, first of all, construct an adequate
foundation.  The installation of Technocracy's design for an intelligent social
operation would provide that strong base.  First things first.
<p>
Another article states that ``clearly, making money dominates the thinking of
many young people with alarming consequences.''  Well, people of all ages must
have money before they can have anything!  The article continues:  ``More than
half the young people questioned admitted bending the rules to get ahead.''
Then  ``The landmarks that told us right from wrong aren't there any more.
They've been hammered away.''  Yes, hammered away by the steadily deteriorating
monetary system wherein, in order to survive, people must bend the rules.  It
is a behavior pattern endemic to a dying social system.
<p>
In commenting on Darwin's <cite>Origin of Species</cite>, the writer says:
``Evolution thus diminished the Bible's authority in the minds of many.''  and
``The impact on morality was devastating.''
<p>
No jobs, no income, is a demoralizing experience for people, regardless of
their age.  The article further states, ``...the churches have a poor record in
providing moral leadership,'' and ``Widespread disillusionment with religion thus
prevails.'' and ``Today's morals are drifting toward nothing less than total
moral collapse.  We need a guide that comes from someone higher than ourselves
-- compare <cite>Proverbs 14.12; Jeremiah 10.23.  </cite>Such a guide
exists.''
<p>
A moneyless method of social operations is most assuredly something ``higher.''
It is the first step in solving our problems.  Because people have to operate
in an inadequate monetary system, their conscience naturally takes a beating.
A government, based on science, would certainly act as a guide to man's vastly
improved behavior.
<p>
The <cite>Awake </cite> writer says that although the Bible
acknowledges that ``dishonest people may seem to prosper, it still
urges us to stay honest.''  Further: ``...the finders keepers
mentality has made thieves of our potentially honest people.''  The
writer says, the Bible ``...encourages kindness, fairness, justice,
truth, honor, decency, a sense of responsibility, and humane concerns
for others.''
<p>
Ignored is any mention of the fact that it is our monetary system of
government that is basically at fault.  Attempts to make people
``moral'' within the confines of an immoral system is impossible.
Social change must come FIRST.  To put morals above physical needs is
to put the cart before the horse.  Change the method of social
operations and morals will improve, because then there no longer will
be ``incentives'' for the immoral behavior that is so rampant today.
<p>
Regarding money, the writer says:  ``Jesus said he would destroy the temple
(Mark 14.57, 58; 15.29).''  Does that mean we should tolerate the vicious money
system because He is coming to straighten out the mess we have created?
``...the anti-Semitism in Christendom has been due to the selfish prejudices of
people who have been Christians in name only.''   Then, further, ``...the
existence of counterfeit money does not disprove the existence of real
money.''
<p>
What is ``real'' money?  Money is the nothing you get for something before you
can have anything!  The concept of money has no physical reality.  It doesn't
measure anything in the physical world.  Thinking in terms of money is an
``addiction'', and ``getting by'' in such a system does, indeed, cause
many people to have a low opinion of themselves and their fellow human beings.
<p>
In another article on <i>``Growing Old With Understanding: the poor
living conditions of many of the elderly are deplorable.</i>'' No
solution to this situation is suggested, except to ``assure'' the
elderly that, in the final analysis, ``old people, above all, should
seek to strengthen their religious bonds.''  The writer goes on to say
that the pursuits older people should involve themselves in, in order
to enjoy a better, more fulfilling life, is to pursue hobbies.  Many
old people are existing on old-age pensions, which aren't enough to
allow them to pay for involvement in various activities.  The article
states: ``The telephone is a wonderful instrument for old persons.''
In making that suggestion, we should not forget that (1) Scientists
invented and improved the telephone, and (2) Many old people don't
have the money to afford a telephone.
<p>
The writer offers this consolation, though:  ``Even those sleeping in death
will awaken to that kind of life in God's righteous world, which will soon
replace the present, unsatisfactory system of things.''  The writer's assurance
is that, ``living today according to such heart-satisfying values is like
building a bank account for the future.''  Technocracy's Energy Accounting
System offers a ``bank account'' that would provide for our future while we are
still living.  Is there anything immoral about that?
<p>
An article on immunization states that, ``Today, immunization programs have
been generally effective in controlling many diseases...'' Who discovered all
of the things relating to immunization?  Scientists, of course.
<p>
Another article warns people about the danger of children swallowing coins.
In a Technate, there would be no coins to swallow.  Another problem solved by
the application of the scientific method.
<p>
An item about <i>Troubled Youngsters</i> concluded with the statement:
``...government officials are convinced that `the root of many problems lies in
the home,' and all indications are that most of the problems are
money-related.''
<p>
Physical things can only be assessed by one's physical senses.  Nonphysical
things can only be guessed at, and that is the area that is causing so much
confusion and conflict.  A path based on FACTS, rather than on
``beliefs'', provides the way to peace and brotherly love.
