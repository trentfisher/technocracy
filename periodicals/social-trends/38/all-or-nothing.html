<P>
This is an election year.  Before it is over North Americans in their
millions will have turned out to elect new local, provincial or state,
and national legislators.  While it has not yet been officially
declared, there are strong hints that Canada will have a federal
election.  South of the border, United States citizens will be
participating in their biennial political circus under congressional and
senatorial election banners.  All balloteers will be exercising the
wholesale expression of that democratic privilege-- their right to mark
millions of little pieces of paper with penciled crosses symbolic of
their social illiteracy.
<P>
For whom do voters vote when they enter the polling booths?  Most of
them seldom know.  Some simply follow ancestral tradition, staunchly
voting straight through on a certain political party's ticket
irrespective of anything said for or against its candidates.  Others may
consider themselves somewhat more discriminating.  They frequently cross
party lines in their choices if they feel, from what the assorted
platformers have told them, that their personal positions will be
improved by so doing.  They are not concerned about probably having had
no voice in nominating the various candidates.  It does not seem to
bother them that they likely never even heard of the candidates until
they were ballyhooed long and loudly by campaign speakers.  When it
finally comes to voting, they find that their decision is determined not
by how much they know of the candidates but by how effectively the
various hopeful incumbents were praised or denounced.  These voters are
ballot drifters, switching their support from party to party according
to their mood of the moment.  It is toward these people that politicians
direct their special attention at election time for upon them hangs
success or failure.
<P>
Politicians are nominated on the strength of their potential ability to
get their respective parties into office and keep them there.  Since
this demands a fair degree of oratorical ability, it is not surprising
that many politicians are chosen from the ranks of lawyers whose good
command of language is part of their stock in trade for a successful
practice.
<P>
Facile language, spoken or written, may be sufficient credentials for
electing lawyers or other non-functionals to public office where they
can enact new legislation, but it does not render them capable of
operating and coordinating the intricate physical equipment upon which
society depends for its existence.  This vital work must be left to
trained personnel--scientists, engineers and technologists.  Yet elected
politicians wield authority over and interfere with the efficiency of
these key appointed men while claiming credit for their accomplishments
in the name of the political party which happens to hold the majority of
seats in the respective government house.
<P>
It is the paradox of our times.  The politicians have the authority but
not the ability to administer the phenomena involved in the operation of
our social mechanism.  Those who have the ability lack the authority.
<P>
While you have been reading this, you may already recognize the validity
of the foregoing.  If this is so and if you agree with what you have
thus far read of Technocracy, you may be asking:  ``Why doesn't
Technocracy run candidates for political office?  I would like to help
the program along, but how can I if I don't get a chance to express my
support of it at the polls?''
<P>
It should be apparent from what has already been said that Technocracy
Inc. has no respect for the political method or for those who engage in
it.  Quite apart from the inability of politics and finance to cope with
the problem of distributing North America's abundance, their combined
stench is becoming increasingly nauseating to the citizens of this
continental area.  So discredited have politics become that even its
strongest proponents are aware of its unsavouriness, albeit they do not
hesitate to exploit its unsavory aspects for their own ends.  Meanwhile,
many citizens, disgusted by the proceedings, are staying away from the
polls--not through apathy, but because of their complete loss of faith in
politics of all shades.
<P>
Technocracy's purpose and objective are much too important to all North
Americans for the Organization to take the chance of being placed in the
same vilified category as politics.  This would be the inevitable result
of its entering the political arena, not because of its programs which
would not yet have been scrutinized by most of the electorate, but
simply because of its association with politics.  The stakes involved
cannot be risked to such hazards.
<P>
Technocracy's design provides for the distribution of this continent's
abundance to all residents.  Since even the largest numerical election
on the continent (U.S. presidential) involves less than half the land
area, it can be seen that any political involvement would necessitate a
compromise of the design with still-existing Price System scarcity
controls.  Such an attempted compromise of abundance with scarcity would
soon prove completely unworkable.  While politicians may make promises
that they have no power or intention of keeping, no self-respecting
Technocrat would do so.  Even were a member to decide for some nebulous
reason to run for elective office, he could do so only after resigning
from Technocracy Inc., for the Organization's overall strategy would not
permit such individual action.
<P>
Technocracy Inc. has no assumption of power theory.  It is an
educational, research organization with no aspirations other than to see
its blueprint of social operation applied to the North American problem
for which it was designed.  When this is accomplished, the
Organization's work will have been completed, thus permitting its
disbanding--probably the first organization in history to welcome its own
demise.  Its members will gain no advantage in the new priceless society
simply because they were Technocrats.  They will take their places
beside their fellow citizens and compete with them for promotion up the
ladder of functional responsibility purely on the basis of demonstrated
ability.  It cannot be otherwise if the social blueprint is to be
effectively instituted.  What is this blueprint that Technocrats are
always talking about?
<P>
Possibly you are thinking of the conventional type of blueprints you
have seen that guide construction men of all categories in building
whatever happens to be their project for the time being--a house, a
skyscraper, a power dam, a ship or what-have-you.  It specifies every
aspect of physical design and materials to be used to complete a given
project.  Technocracy's blueprint differs from the type with which you
are familiar only quantitatively.  Instead of being limited to
individual aspects of the physical equipment that makes society run, it
takes the entire continental operation into account and shows how it
must be run to bring social mechanics into conformity with the rapidly
developing nature of our mid-Twentieth Century technological processes. 
Even as the over-all design of an airplane intended to fly at supersonic
speeds determines how each of its parts must be constructed, so the
intention to establish in North America the highest standard of living
that man has ever known must be determined by a continental design that
will necessarily modify the character of the details.  If this seems a
mite arbitrary to you, imagine for a moment what that supersonic plane
would be like if all of its parts were built separately by individuals
who had no plans and no ideas about what the end product was to be. 
Bring all the parts together and assemble them--if you could.  Would it
fly?  And if it would, do you think it would fly faster than sound? 
Just how far can your imagination carry you anyway?
<P>
Today's hodgepodge society is a replica of the fantasy in which you have
just been asked to indulge.  If the parts sometimes fit together, it is
largely by accident for they have never been planned as integral units
of a comprehensive social mechanism.  This lack of planning--or, at best,
piece-meal planning-- has resulted in much unnecessary sickness and
suffering, and in a staggering toll of untimely deaths.  Our highways
alone have accounted for more people killed than our combined armed
forces' casualties totalled in the two major wars occurring since the
invention of the automobile.  Increasing crime is another product of
myopic Price System operation.
<P>
The Technocracy blueprint transcends any that has ever before been drawn
up.  It will make the most effective use of this continent's vast
resources, energy potential and technical know-how to provide all
citizens with those basic requirements of a physical organism in human
form--food, clothing and shelter--for the provisions of which society
exists and is primarily responsible.
<P>
In fulfilling this responsibility and supplying numerous amenities, the
Technocracy blueprint in operation will permeate the entire functional
administration.  Where today we have individual plans for houses, the
blueprint would provide for continental housing far superior to anything
now known.  Instead of a mass of family-operated farms, there would be
huge 25-mile square tracts of fertile land administered by soil
specialists and agrotechnologists.  Locally built highways would give
way to an integrated continental transportation system wherein vehicles
and thoroughfares were specifically designed for each other.  In
addition, the blueprint specifies implementation of the nonmonetary
Energy Certificate, construction of a Continental Hydrology, a
functional calendar, a continental defense system, and many other phases
of operation that are further explained in other literature of the
organization.
<P>
You will have noted that the blueprint is always referred to as applying
to the entire continent rather than to any one of the several national
political divisions of which it is comprised.  To the nationally
inclined person this may seem an infringement of national sovereignties,
but this is only because they are blinding themselves to the physical
nature of the land area upon which they live.   They refuse to recognize
the functional impracticality of letting lines drawn in wholly arbitrary
positions on maps determine how the land area shall be administered. 
The political divisions thus formed, both local and national, seldom
coincide with the natural topographical divisions of mountains, plains,
lakes and rivers, which are the primary determinants of our standard of
living, providing as they do our resources, food supply and power.
<a name="part2"> </a>
<P>
The North American Continent is a land mass whose physical configuration
cannot be chopped up like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle.  Its parts are so
interrelated and its many operations so interdependent that virtually
nothing can be done anywhere that does not have its influence felt
elsewhere, sometimes thousands of miles away.  Even today it is becoming
increasingly more recognized that where certain engineering measures
must be taken that affect both Canada and United States, they must be
taken completely without regard to the intervening boundary line.  Such
an instance was that of the Pacific Salmon Fisheries Commission that was
formed in 1913 to save the industry in the Fraser River after a rock
slide seriously imperilled it, preventing the sockeye salmon from
proceeding upstream to their spawning areas.  More recently we find both
countries finally cooperating in the construction of the long-talked-of 
St. Lawrence Seaway and Power Project; while joint defense maneuvers by
the armed forces suggest that there, too, boundaries are recognized only
as hindrances in conditions of emergency.
<P>
It evolves, therefore, that any adequate design and operation of the
productive and distributive processes that provide North Americans with
their basic requirements must take in the whole continental area.  That
is exactly what the Technocracy blueprint does!  Obviously, then, it
cannot be cut up and applied regionally with any hope of success any
more than a segment of the continent can be satisfactorily operated
within its own territorial boundaries.  ALL OR NOTHING must therefore
be, and is, the objective for Technocracy's social blueprint! Can this
be achieved with politics and finance so strongly entrenched?
<P>
In answering this question it must be realized that these institutions
are powerful only within the framework of the Price System, which is the
major entity since it comprises both of the others.  The breakdown of
the parent body would automatically result in the dissolution of its
integral parts.  Events both on and off the continent are shaping up in
such a way as to suggest that this breakdown may not be far in the
future.  Investigate the trends for yourself.
<P>
Yet there can be no pat answer to the question.  The job of impressing
North Americans with the necessity of substituting their obsolete Price
System with a functional administration has not been an easy one, but
Technocrats realize that boom times (whether real or artificial) do not
promote social consciousness.  This realization prevents them from being
dismayed even though some have been members for twenty years or more. 
(Today this figure may be extended to 50 years or more.)  They remember
that during the Depression 30s, Technocracy Inc. was the fastest growing
organization on the continent.  They remember too that only a global war
was big enough to revitalize the ailing Price System with a transfusion
capable of making most people forget their financial worries while
entering into the orgy of war-induced prosperity at the expense of
thousands of lives on overseas battlefields.  Various devices such as
ostensible post-war rehabilitation campaigns and the largest peace-time
armament program in history sustained the economy in the ensuing decade,
but only through a constant battle against the inexorable advances of
technological abundance.  Today the Price System is again in serious
trouble.  Its prosperity bubble is in imminent danger of bursting just
as it did in 1929 under very similar conditions.  Despite deficit
financing, subsidies and all the other gimmicks employed to keep the
economy going today, our growing abundance (automation-assisted),
combined with declining markets will soon crush the Price System economy
on this continent.  WHEN (not if) this happens, the scarcity mechanisms
of politics and business will be powerless to put the economy again on
its feet.  Once more with their backs to the wall, North Americans will
turn to Technocracy Inc., the only organization with a program capable
of handling the situation.
<P>
Technocrats have worked steadily over the years to put that program
before as many North Americans as possible.  Avoidance of the emotional
approach such as is familiar to politicians has limited membership
enrollment, but it has built a growing nucleus of members who were
intellectually attracted to the program and whose emotional stability
was much better adapted to the long pull.  Most members are average
citizens whose first objective is to publicize the blueprint.  Having
only average educations for the most part they are not personally
qualified to administer the physical equipment of the continent, nor
would they presume to seek an elective office that would place them in
so responsible a position.  However, they can and do promote to their
utmost the social blueprint that would put administrative authority into
the hands of those scientists, technologists and engineers who are
already responsible for the operation of the vital sequences but are
today interfered with at every turn by obsolescent Price System
controls.
<P>
To inform North Americans about the next most probable form of society
to prevail on this continent, Technocrats distribute literature, give
public lectures and conduct study classes.  The objective of this is to
develop a corps of informed citizens capable of giving competent
leadership in a time of social crisis.  It is NOT, as may be supposed,
intended to place Technocracy Inc. or any of its members in positions of
authoritarian control.  We have already pointed out that the very nature
of the blueprint precludes such purpose or intention.  Whatever might
develop from that ill-advised tactic would amount to treason for it
would obstruct the full implementation of the government by skill
demanded by North America's uniquely intricate technology.
<P>
A Technocrat entering the political field would necessarily have to make
a lot of promises in order to be elected.  Once elected he would be
expected to introduce Technocracy's social program in full or in part
within his particular constituency.  He would be unable to do so--even if
he had the full support of the electorate and was completely sincere in
wanting to carry out his promises.  Opposition from surrounding Price
System controlled areas would combine with the resource deficiencies of
the restricted area to result in the experiment's utter failure.  The
harm thus done would be immeasurable if not irreparable.  It would
largely cancel out all that Technocracy has achieved in making North
Americans aware of and tolerant toward--if not yet enthusiastic for its
functional blueprint.  Herein lies the main reason for Technocracy
Inc.'s refusal to enter the political arena.
<P>
The failure of a Technocratic form of society to work in a small area
might be taken as evidence that it could not be effectively applied
continentally.  Such a conclusion is unwarranted, especially in
reference to North America for the reverse happens to be the case.  The
blueprint cannot be expected to function in a small area any more than
an ocean liner could be expected to maneuver in a ten-acre pond.  It was
designed for and is operable only in a Continentalism.
<P>
From what has been said it might be surmised that North American voters
will never have the opportunity to endorse the Technocracy blueprint,
but this is not necessarily so.  While it cannot be known in advance
what precise conditions will prevail when the Price System bows out,
certain courses of action avail themselves according to then existing
requirements.  Among the several tactical choices is the already
well-known plebiscite or referendum.
<P>
Frequently today you are asked to vote for a THING rather than a party
or person.  It may be a bylaw to grant authority for the spending of
money on some proposed project, or it may be to determine whether or not
you favor professional sports on Sunday.  Whatever its purpose, the
referendum's outcome is a direct expression of the electorate's wishes
and the majority of ``Yes'' or ``No'' votes decides the issue.  Actually, if
the ideal of ``government by the people'' were practised, the referendum
would decide all issues, but the obvious impracticality of this unwieldy
procedure in an organized society paved the way for representative
government.  This, too, must soon go by the board.
<P>
The referendum may be used to put the Technocracy blueprint in
operation.  If so, at least two-thirds (in contrast to the presently
required just over half) of all votes must approve the blueprint before
it will be inaugurated.  This last vote within the framework of the
Price System will be the most important that North Americans have ever
made, for they will be deciding whether they will move forward into an
era of unstinted abundance or whether they will allow the inadequate,
bungling controls of the Price System to exterminate many of them.  The
march of events will  be the major determinant in the issue.
<P>
Time is drawing short and Technocracy Inc. still has much work to do. 
However, despite today's apparent prosperity, Price System champions are
considerably disquieted by alarming symptoms of instability.  They are
afraid of what automation is doing to national purchasing power.  This
newest productive technique is building up unprecedented quantities of
various products, but they are largely lying in warehouses unsold.  If
this trend continues, as every indication promises, these goods will
constitute a growing ledger liability and will be just so much useless
junk.  When this occurs the captains of industries will lose all
interest in their ``businesses.''
<P>
As they find it preferable to preserve their own lives to defunct
business, they may be expected to realize at last the validity of
Technocracy's analysis and that the institution of its social program
will be their only hope of continued survival.  Channels of
communication now closed to the Organization will then be opened wide
for an unlimited dissemination of the Technocracy blueprint to the North
American public.
<P>
Will they respond to the picture painted by television, radio, screen
and press?  We may find the answer to that in the way they respond to
current political campaigns that promise much and return nothing.  They
respond immediately and with great emotional zeal to anything that
personally affects them.  There is little doubt how they would cast
their final Price System ballot were it laid on the line that their only
hope for future survival lay in the direction indicated by Technocracy
Inc.
<P>
The referendum, of course, is only one method that might be employed to
institute the social blueprint mentioned herein.  Which method is used
is not particularly important.  What is important is that it must
eventually be instituted, and when it is it must be for the entire
continent.  Nothing less will suffice.  It must be ALL OR NOTHING.
