<p>
Every politico-economic ideology, like every religious belief,
proclaims that it has the one true doctrine and that all others
are either entirely different or at "opposite poles."
<p>
They are largely successful in this kind of indoctrination and
propaganda--with students and the public at large, as well as
with philosophers, textbook authors, newspaper publishers, et
al--because they incessantly emphasize, exaggerate, and
reiterate the minor differences while ignoring what they have in
common.  This making-a-mountain-out-of-a-molehill game is
similar to not seeing the forest for the trees and is just what
the leaders of these vast divisions want the public to base
their attitudes on; thus, the extremist's desperation where he
cries to his followers:  "It's either we or they, black or
white, good or bad, etc."  In the U.S., as a result of the Cold
War for instance, the game is so rigged that critical thinking
and constructive action have been muted by repetitions of the
official propaganda line:  "If you don't like what we have
here...with all its imperfections...the only other alternative
is some form of Marxian socialism or a fascistic dictatorship--
and you don't want them!"
<p>
So the socially concerned man and woman, the idealistic youth,
are circumvented and their efforts are swerved into one or
another ostentatious but petty reform movement, or some outright
escapism.
<p>
How many, or rather how few, have exclaimed something like--"To
Hell with those foreign isms!  And with the imported monopolism
of high finance misruling and despoiling this Continent...Let's
start building a nation fit for everyone to live in--not just
exist!"
<p>
In effect that is what fifteen men and one woman did in 1918-19
in New York City, led by Howard Scott, a young engineering
scientist in his 20s who organized them into what was known as
the Technical Alliance.  These engineers, mathematicians,
architects, foresters, statisticians, educators, chemists,
physicists, physicians, et al, had been working in their
professional capacities directly or indirectly for the Federal
Government during World War I.  Among them were Dr. Charles P.
Steinmetz, the "Wizard of General Electric"; Professor Richard
Tolman, physicist and during World War II vice chairman of the
National Research Board that Vannevar Bush headed; Leland Olds,
whom President Roosevelt made Chairman of the Federal Power
Commission in the 1930s and 40s; the president of the American
Institute of Architects; the chief of the Bureau of Chemistry of
the U.S. Department of Agriculture; Dr. Alice Barrows Fernandez,
who had studied under John Dewey and who later became the Chief
of the Division of the Design of School Buildings for the U.S.
Office of Education; Professor Thorstein Veblen, the "Stormy
Petrel" of American economics; et al...not a group of wishful-
thinking philosophers but a nucleus of trained professionals.
<p>
These trained professionals recognized what could be
accomplished in coordinating the nation's resources for war.
Under Howard Scott's leadership they set out to investigate the
possibility and feasibility of coordinating the nation's
resources in peacetime in order to eliminate waste, increase
technical efficiency, mechanize industry to reduce manhours, and
multiply production so that a higher standard of living could be
provided to everyone, not just a favored few.  That was how the
idea of Technocracy got its start.
<p>
In order to understand the social design that Technocracy
proposes as uniquely relevant to our North American Continent,
it is first necessary to make clear what it is not.  This is
because all ideologies of the past and present are variations
and branches of one system:  the Price/Political System.  Thus,
whether feudalism or liberal republics, capitalism or socialism,
monarchy or democracy, fascism or cooperatives, the most benign
commonwealth or the most repressive dictatorial tyranny...all
without exception are based on, and take for granted, as being
fundamental for any society, a) political rule, and b) economic-
monetary-price values.
<p>
The socialist-communist countries are no less tied to the
ancient anachronisms of money, price, interest, taxes, debt,
wages, etc., as are the so-called capitalistic nations, which is
only natural since they too are still laboring under scarcity.
Only the superficial labels of "ownership" are different.  The
fiduciary "mechanics" of mankind are essentially the same,
however, whether within the Chase Manhattan Bank, Barclays of
London, or the Kremlin's Gosbank.  The main difference is that
the Gosbank is larger--the largest bank in the world in terms of
monetary holdings.  In fact, "Bolshevik" Russia today has five
times as many banks as does the U.S.A., and Red China has three
times as many.
<p>
Economics in any and all forms rests on the assumption of
conditions of natural or artificially enforced scarcity, far
less than enough to supply everyone.  The study of economics and
its everyday business control and transactions tells you how
each variation of the Price System makes an ideology of how to
divide up that scarcity.  You will find economics defined in
terms of scarcity in every textbook on the subject, usually in
the opening chapter.  Without scarcity, some of them candidly
admit, there would be no need for economics.
<p>
Politics, regardless of what label it goes under, is
fundamentally concerned with the manipulation and coercion-
control of millions of human beings as well as each individual
one.  The skill and ability to stay in office, whether a
senator, commissar, king, or president, depends on how well he
manipulates the people in his domain...usually in terms of how
well he has them fooled, as Machiavelli postulated the game.
<p>
There are no exceptions to these generalizations; all societies,
whether primitive or the most sophisticated and "advanced"
today, are run entirely within the framework of the rules of the
game of Political government and Economics.  The inherent anti-
social features of these rules have been obvious to all thinking
people throughout recorded history--especially to those
humanistically concerned.  All they have been able to do is hope
for a more benign ruler to be born, or to vote for more "honest"
politicians...the wishful thinking futility of these purported
choices and alternatives is dreary reading.
<p>
<em><strong>Enter Technology:</strong></em>  As long as
scarcity, the natural scarcity that still prevails throughout
the Third World, only partially diminished in East
Europe and West Europe, and toil and labor--both concomitants of
little or no technological
<p>
energy--was the lot of humankind, then there was nothing that
could be done to ameliorate the poverty and oppression of the
majority of the populations.  Then a group of scientists,
technologists, engineers, and other professionals--the Technical
Alliance, 1918-21--pointed out that the development of
technological power in the U.S. and Canada had rendered the
ancient Price/Political System not only unnecessary and obsolete
on this continent but increasingly dangerous for us to tolerate.
<p>
Despite their preliminary Energy Survey of North America and
their warnings, the prosperity of the 1920s temporarily
sidetracked their message.  A decade later the Price/Political
System in the U.S.A. almost collapsed for the first time
anywhere in world history.
<p>
To protect the scientific integrity of its brilliant concept,
Howard Scott in 1933 incorporated Technocracy Inc. as a non-
profit educational and research organization, open to North
American citizens from all walks of life and not solely the
scientifically trained.  Since then many North Americans have
become members to study the possibilities, advantages, and the
necessity of applying science to social problems, and to write
and speak about the idea.
<p>
<strong><a name="part2">The Design:</a></strong>What Technocracy proposes
is the world's first functional society.  The first step is for
the people of the U.S. and Canada to abandon once and for all
the archaic game of Politico-Economic rule over human life on
this continent.  There is only one sane and orderly way to do
this:  by national referendum.  But remember, it is a matter of
survival, not choice; the System's waste of irreplaceable
natural and human resources, of air and water pollution with
worse depredations to come offer us no alternative.
<p>
To succeed the ancient Price-Political System, Technocracy
proposes that the functionally trained men and women of this
Continent immediately form a coordinating staff for the
governance of the entire North American Continent's
<p>
34 billion technological Hp in factories, refineries, farm
tractors, mining machines, all transportation as well as the
coordination of the geological and ecological resources with
that technology--for one purpose only:  to meet human needs,
both material and cultural, of the men, women and children of
the entire continent.
<p>
Instead of money juggling and politics, interdisciplinary
science and engineering at all levels from the top down would
make the decisions as to planning and operating all our
technology on a balanced load basis.  Maximum mechanization and
automation would reduce work time, giving people more hours to
pursue cultural and recreational interests.  Maximum use of
renewable resources (hydropower carrying the base electric load
instead of coal, oil, or nuclear power).  Maximum use of all
mining, agricultural, construction and industrial equipment
operating at full blast night and day throughout the year would
turn out an abundance of only the highest quality of goods since
sleazy products waste valuable resources.
<p>
Contrary to what the economics textbooks would have us believe,
psychologists have found that most people are not working for
money.  The average man, if lucky enough to be doing the kind of
work he enjoys, does it for the satisfaction of accomplishment
and social esteem, knowing that the pay he gets will provide a
decent standard of living for himself and family.  The goal in
life for creative minds is to have the facilities for working
out their ideas and acceptance of their best works.
<p>
Everyone would receive sufficient purchasing power in the form
of Energy Certificates since the technological energy input for
the production of all consumer and other products is technically
measurable and the basis for a continuous Continental
accounting.  These certificates, having none of the
characteristics of money/price/debt, could not be used for
anything but acquiring any unit--say a dress or a tie or a book
or a dozen oranges, etc., and any order would be instantly
tabulated by the technicians whose job it is to keep the supply
lines filled with more of the same.  The certificate would
possess some of the features of a traveler's check, an IBM punch
card or electronic imprinted data face and a factory requisition
form, none of whose details the citizen-user would have to be
bothered with.
<p>
Everyone would receive their own annual book of Energy
Purchasing Cards free as a right of citizenship no matter what
one's occupational status or age or sex or color or race.  To
science there is only one race:  The human race!  Nor would
these Energy Cards be based on the work you do or whether you
work at all.  This is simply recognition of the fact that
technology is doing 99.9% of all the work so it is only
functional and rational to distribute the abundance freely to
all on the basis of what the machines are producing.  This is
democracy on a daily basis with everybody having the same vote
and getting exactly what they voted for.
<p>
Exchange value for measurement and 95% of crime that the FBI
states is for money, either directly or indirectly, would be
eliminated at once without passing a single law or without any
moral reformation in the individual.  (The remaining 5% of crime
is pathological and will take time to diminish.)  This
historically unprecedented act of removing the incentive for
crime is worth a functional social system for this reason alone.
But Technocracy is concerned more with social crimes such as the
waste of natural resources, poverty, accidents, pollution, the
Cold War, and disease, all of which are engendered by the Price
System.
<p>
What of the social and cultural consequences?  For the first
time in human history there would be no more fear of deprivation
and poverty; no more fear of political persecution or injustice;
no more wastage of human talent; no more financial or other
limitations on education; no more sex discrimination; no more
racial discrimination; no more crime in the streets or anywhere
else.  No more commercialization of the arts and sex; no more
financialization of health care; no more welfare or charity or
poor; no more child labor or child beating or wife beating
(remember, she has her own Energy Certificate, so you'd better
be good, brother!); no more rackets of any kind from Mafia to
gambling to the munitions/war promoters and drug dealers.  The
list of social depredations is almost endless, the new freedoms
unbounded.  All goods and services would be free to everyone:
no prices, debts, taxes, profits, wages, charity, graft,
insurance, banking, swindling, advertising, or any other kind of
chiseling, disadvantages, or exploitation either of people or
our natural resources.
<p>
This means engineering with Nature, not against her as Economics
and Politics do, because in a Technate the agricultural and
ecological specialists, the hydrologists and technologists would
constantly be meshing their knowledge in an interdisciplinary
functional way to obtain the most finished products for the
minimum expenditure of energy and the minimum use of
nonrenewable raw materials.
<p>
Scientists and engineers aren't trained to tell people what to
do.  They concentrate on getting the job done, solving problems.
Those who do prefer controlling people--politicians,
businessmen, bankers, etc., will all be retired or off to Spain
or some likely place with all the gold bars they can carry and
where they can still practice business.
<p>
What will happen to religion?  Take the mortgage from the
outside of the church and the collection plate from the inside,
and only those clergymen sincerely interested in the spiritual
welfare of their parishioners will stay on the job,
automatically weeding out a lot of sanctimonious Pharisees now
pontificating.  People will become attuned to the rationality
and reality of human life and achievement.
