Humans are destroying animal and plant species at an &quot;alarming
rate&quot;, according to the United Nation's first comprehensive
report on the world's fading biodiversity.
<p>
More than 30,000 species are threatened with extinction, it said.  The
assessment puts the minimum number of species threatened with
extinction at 5,400 animals and 26,100 plants, but the estimate only
covers species that are known and have been classified by scientists.
<p>
In addition to the increase of endangered species, the 1,140 page
<cite>Global Biodiversity Assessment</cite> chronicles the loss of
genes, habitat and ecosystems.
<p>
Biodiversity represents the very foundation of human existence (all
life).  Yet by our heedless actions we are eroding this biological
resource of the world at a dangerous rate.
<p>
The report cites several reasons for the rapid decline in species, including:
<ul>
  <li>Increased population and economic deveropment that deplete
      biological and natural habitats.
  <li>Human failure to consider the long-term consequences of actions
      that destroy habitat, exploit natural resources and introduce
      non-native species.
  <li>Failure of economic markets to recognize the real value and
      purpose od maintaining the variety of species.
  <li>Increased human migration, travel and international trade.
  <li>The ever increasing spread of land, water and air polution
</ul>

<p>
The life of everything is in some way intertwined and dependent on
each other, and Homo sapiens are a part of this biodiversity of
species.  The existence of all life is dependent on maintaining a
balance in the environmental and ecological systems.  Any disruption
in these systems and habitat can have a precarious effect and impact
on our existence.  But human kind is bringing about its own demise and
eventual extinction.  Given an economic system that is merely based on
development and growth, investments to merely maximize profits through
the exploitation of this earth's finite resource base have only
accelerated the demise and extinction of the species.  Unless there is
a comprehensive and fundamental change in the operation of the
economic system in a way that is compatible with the natural
environment, eventual destruction becomes inevitable and any
sustainability becomes impossible.
