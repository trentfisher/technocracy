The English people once punished criminals by sending them away.  They
would load them on a ship and export them to Australia.  England was
owned by lords and nobles and rich people.  They owned the whole earth
over there, and the other people had to stay in the streets.  They
could not get a decent living.  They used to take their criminals and
send them to Australia&#151;I mean the class of criminals who got
caught.  When these criminals got over there, and nobody else had
come, they had the whole continent to run over, and so they could
raise sheep and furnish their own meat, which is easier than stealing
it.  These criminals then became decent, respectable people because
they had a chance to live.  They did not commit any crimes.  They were
just like the English people who sent them there, only better.  And in
the second generation the descendants of those criminals were as good
and respectable a class of people as there were on the face of the
earth, and then they began building churches and jails themselves.
<p>
But finally the descendants of the English aristocracy who sent the
people over to Australia found out they were getting rich, and so they
went over to get possession of the earth as they always do, and they
organized land syndicates and got control of the land and ores, and
then they had just as many criminals in Australia as they did in
England.  It was not because the world had grown bad; it was because
the earth had been taken away from the people.
<p>
Some of you people have lived in the country.  It's prettier than
it is here.  And if you have ever lived on a farm you understand that
if you put a lot of cattle in a field, when the pasture is short they
will jump over the fence; but put them in a good field where there is
plenty of pasture, and they will be law-abiding cattle to the end of
time.  The human animal is just like the rest of the animals, only a
little more so.  The same thing that governs in the one governs in the
other.
<p>
Everybody makes his living along the lines of least resistance.  A
wise man who comes into a country early sees a great undeveloped land.
For instance, our rich men twenty-five years ago saw that Chicago was
small and knew a lot of people would come here and settle, and they
readily saw that if they had all the land around here it would be
worth a good deal, so they grabbed the land.  You cannot be a landlord
because somebody has got it all.  You must find some other calling.
In England and Ireland and Scotland less than five percent own all the
land there is, and the people are bound to stay there on any kind of
terms the landlords give.  They must live the best they can, so they
develop all these various professions&#151;burglary, picking pockets
and the like.
<p>
Again, people find all sorts of ways of getting rich.  These are
diseases like everything else.  You look at people getting rich,
organizing trusts and making a million dollars, and somebody gets the
disease and he starts out.  He catches it just as a man catches the
mumps or the measles; he is not to blame; it is in the air.  You will
find men speculating beyond their means, because the mania of
money-getting is taking possession of them.  It is simply a
disease&#151;nothing more, nothing less.  You cannot avoid catching
it; but the fellows who have control of the earth have the advantage
of you.  See, what the law is: When these men get control of things,
they make the laws.  They do not make the laws to protect anybody;
courts are not instruments of justice.  When your case gets into court
it will make little difference whether you are guilty or innocent, but
it's better if you have a smart lawyer.  And you cannot have a smart
lawyer unless you have money.  First and last it's a question of
money.  Those men who own the earth make the laws to protect what they
have.  They fix up a sort of fence or pen around what they have, and
they fix the law so the fellow on the outside cannot get in.  The laws
are really organized for the protection of the men who rule the world.
They were never organized or enforced to do justice.  We have no
system for doing justice, not the slightest in the world.
<p>
Let me illustrate:  Take the poorest person in this room.  If the
community had provided a system of doing justice, the poorest person
in this room would have as good a lawyer as the richest, would he not?
When you went into court you would have just as long a trial and just
as fair a trial as the richest person in Chicago.
<p>
Then if you were rich and were beaten, your case would be taken to the
Appellate Court.  A poor man cannot take his case to the Appellate
Court; he has not the price.  And then to the Supreme Court.  And if
he were beaten there he might perhaps go to the United States Supreme
Court.  And he might die of old age before he got into jail. If you
are poor, it's a quick job.  You are almost known to be guilty, else
you would not be there.  Why should anyone be in the criminal court if
he were not guilty?  He would not be there if he could be anywhere
else.  The officials have no time to look after all these cases.  The
people who are on the outside, who are running banks and building
churches and making jails, they have no time to examine 600 or 700
prisoners each year to see whether they are guilty or innocent.  If
the courts were organized to promote justice, the people would elect
somebody to defend all these criminals, somebody as smart as the
prosecutor&#151;and give him as many detectives and as many assistants
to help, and pay as much money to defend you as to prosecute you.
<p>
Most all of our criminal code consists in offenses against property.
People are sent to jail because they have committed a crime against
property.  It is of very little consequence whether 100 people more or
less go to jail who ought not to go&#151;you must protect property,
because in this world property is of more importance than anything
else.
<p>
How is it done?  These people who have property fix it so they can
protect what they have.  When somebody commits a crime it does not
follow that he has done something that is morally wrong.  The man on
the outside who has committed no crime may have done something.  For
instance:  to take all the coal in the United States and raise the
price two dollars or three dollars when there is no need of it, and
thus kill thousands of babies and send thousands of people to the
poorhouse and tens of thousands to jail, as is done every year in the
United States&#151;this is a greater crime than all the people in our
jails ever committed; but the law does not punish it.  Why?  Because
the fellows who control the earth make the laws.  If you and I had the
making of the laws, the first thing we would do would be to punish the
fellow who gets control of the earth.  Nature put this coal in the
ground for me as well as for them and nature made the prairies up here
to raise wheat for me as well as for them, and then the great railroad
companies came along and fenced it up.
<p>
Most all of the crimes for which we are punished are property crimes.
The people up and down the Lake Shore have not committed crime; still
they have so much property they don't know what to do with it.  It is
perfectly plain why these people have not committed crimes against
property; they make the laws and therefore do not need to break them.
<p>
I will guarantee to take from this jail, or any jail in the world, 500
men who have been the worst criminals and lawbreakers who ever got
into jail, and I will go down to our lowest streets and take 500 of
the most abandoned prostitutes, and go out somewhere where there is
plenty of land, and will give them a chance to make a living, and they
will be as good people as the average in the community.
<p>
There is a remedy for the sort of condition we see here.  The world
never finds it out, or when it does find it out it does not enforce
it.  You may pass a law punishing every person with death for
burglary, and it will make no difference.  Men will commit it just the
same.  In England there was a time when 100 different offenses were
punishable with death, and it made no difference.  The English people
strangely found out that so fast as they repealed the severe penalties
and so fast as they did away with punishing men by death, crime
decreased instead of increased; that the smaller the penalty the fewer
the crimes.
<p>
Hanging men in our county jails does not prevent murder.  It makes murderers.
<p>
And this has been the history of the world.  It's easy to see how to
do away with what we call crime.  It is not so easy to do it.  I will
tell you how to do it.  It can be done by giving the people a chance
to live&#151;by destroying special privileges.  So long as big
criminals can get the coal fields, so long as the big criminals have
control of the city council and get the public streets for streetcars
and gas rights&#151;this is bound to send thousands of poor people to
jail.  So long as men are allowed to monopolize all the earth, and
compel others to live on such terms as these men see fit to make, then
you are bound to get into jail.
<p>
The only way in the world to abolish crime and criminals is to abolish
the big ones and the little ones together.  Make fair conditions of
life.  Give men a chance to live.  Abolish the right of private
ownership of land, abolish monopoly, make the world partners in
production, partners in the good things of life.  Nobody would steal
if he could get something of his own some easier way.  Nobody will
commit burglary when he has a house full.  No girl will go out on the
streets when she has a comfortable place at home.  The man who owns a
sweatshop or a department store may not be to blame himself for the
condition of his girls, but when he pays them five dollars, three
dollars, and two dollars a week, I wonder where he thinks they will
get the rest of their money to live.  The only way to cure these
conditions is by equality.  There should be no jails.  They do not
accomplish what they pretend to accomplish.  If you would wipe them
out there would be no more criminals than now.  They terrorize nobody.
They are a blot upon any civilization, and a jail is an evidence of
the lack of charity of the people on the outside who make the jails
and fill them with the victims of their greed.
