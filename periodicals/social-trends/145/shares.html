EXTOLLERS of the private capitalist system, or its
brainwashed idealists, will try to allay all concerns as to one-
bank holding companies, and their interlock-directorships, by
contending that the majority of the American people own the
corporation's shares, elect the boards of directors, and are
thereby the real owners and arbiters of the enterprises.
<p>
<strong>Nothing could be further from the truth!</strong>
<p>
There have been many studies and reports as to stock ownership.
One of the most comprehensive coverages is to be found in the
book, <strong>The Rich and the Super-Rich, </strong>by Ferdinand
Lundberg, which was published in 1968.  It brought out the fact
that of all the 54 million spending units (one or more persons
established as a household), 86 percent owned no stock at all.
Of those with income between $7500 and $10,000, 78 percent owned
no stock.  Of those with income between $5000 and $7000, 81
percent owned no stock.
<p>
Bearing in mind that anyone qualifies as a stockholder if he or
she owns only one share worth fifty cents, it is an exercise in
incredulity to portray the general public, "little old ladies in
tennis shoes", as the across-the-board stockholders in the
nation's monopolistic, corporate conglomerates.
<p>
Lundberg's research underscored the revealing fact that two
percent of the adult population owned 32 percent of all
privately owned wealth in the nation. Such ownership consisted
of <em>82.2 percent of all stock</em>, along with vast ownership
in bonds, mortgages, pension and retirement funds, property and
real estate.
<p>
A further revealing fact was that 60 percent of all stock
ownership was not earned but inherited. . . .
<p>
<h4>Voting Rights in Major Corporations</h4>
<p>
This definitive Study, dated January, 1978, was released by the
Subcommittee on Reports, Accounting and Management, a
subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs.
Out of this Study emerges the fact that it is not stock
ownership that is crucial but who votes that stock.  And it
substantiates the circumstance that it is not individual
stockholders but banks and investment institutions that have the
real voting power.  The Study states:
<p>
<blockquote>
<em>Voting rights to about half of the stock in U.S.
corporations are held by banks and trust companies, foundations
and educational endowments.  The rest of the stock is widely
held by individuals and organizations such as private investment
companies, brokerage firms, fraternal and religious
organizations and hedge funds, which generally are partnerships
formed for investment purposes of a speculative nature.  Many
individual stockholders do not bother to exercise their voting
rights, which in most instances are infinitesimal alongside
those of institutional investors.  The Soviet-syle
election typically held by corporations -- with a
single slate of directors and an auditor, sharply restricted
communications among voters and procedural impediments to
provision of choices for them -- does not induce participation,
especially when one institution can out-vote thousands of
individuals. . .</em>
</blockquote>
<p>
Quite clearly  the individual stockholder has no decision-making voice
in corporate business or policy.  Of course, in
small corporations, often family operated, there is a voice but
their share of the productive capability of the nation is
insignificant as to volume.  Further, the future plight of the
small retailer, the small manufacturer and small farmer involves
accelerated foreclosures as monopolies in all fields gain
increased power.
<p>
What about the workers, tens of millions, and their pension
plans?  What voice do the workers have in determining the safe
investment of their hard-earned dollars?  The Study had this to
say:
<p>
<blockquote>
<em>Pension funds nominally comprise the largest category of
stockholding.  Private noninsured pension fund stock had a
market value of $109.7 billion and State and local retirement
fund stock a market value of $30.1 billion, for a total of
$139.8 billion at the end of 1976 , according to the SEC.  Large
corporate pension funds will double in less than 5 years and
double again by 1986, according to a recent estimate by
Greenwich Associates.  However, most pension funds are not self-
administered.  Management of pension assets, including the
authority to buy, sell and vote equities, is concentrated among
banks, insurance and  investment- investment advisory
companies.</em>
</blockquote>
<p>
Another excerpt from the study is important to note.  It covers
the concentration of stock control and what corporate entities
managed what percent of existing stock.  This is the breakdown
that was arrived at:
<p>
<blockquote>
<em>A recent indication of the concentration of stock control
can be found in the tabulation of the 100 largest equity
managers, as of the end of 1976, by <cite>Institutional
Investor.</cite>  The 100 firms managed stock with a market
value of about $300 billion.  That was approximately
four-fifths of all the stock managed by institutional investors.
Among the 100, banks managed almost
50 percent of the stock, investment advisory complexes 23
percent, insurance companies about 9.5 percent.  Self-
administered corporate pension funds and self-administered
public pension funds each managed about 3.4 percent and
foundations less than 1 percent.</em>
</blockquote>
<p>
The foregoing documentation, accentuating
institutional, concentrated control of major stock, should
dispel any doubt as to who are the real arbiters of corporate
policy.  It should also clarify for TV watchers how so many tens
of millions of stock could be sold and bought each day at the
Stock Exchange.  Of significant importance, of course, is
understanding who actually manipulates the ups and downs of the
stock market.
<p>
Even the least informed shareholder must question the integrity
and honesty of the stock market that fluctuates in value by tens
of billions of dollars overnight.  Certainly, the most gullible
buyer and seller of individual stocks must have experienced
extreme bewilderment over Black Monday, October 19, 1987, when
the market plummeted 508 points.  This was equivalent to a loss
of 508 billion dollars of stock value within a span of 24 hours!
<p>
The relevant question is:  <em>How could the worth of
corporations, measured in terms of their tangible machinery,
buildings and assets, become one-half trillion dollars less in
value overnight?</em>
<p>
Facetiously, one might query did it happen by a
certain configuration of spots on the sun, or simply by the
perverseness of inanimate objects?  Levity aside, beneath all
the intricacies of the Dow Jones closings and economic indexes,
the answer to the stock market plunge is inescapably clear.
<p>
It happened by the selling and buying of stock by powerful
institutional investors who have financial axes to grind.  And
the losers?  They are simply those who are not privy to what is
being manipulated based on inside information.
<p>
Periodically, an Ivan Boesky, a Milken or an E.F. Hutton are
brought before the bar of justice, but only a slap on the wrist
is meted out to them and there is no deterrent penalty assessed
that precludes others from similar exploitive, criminal action.
<p>
The Stock Market contributes nothing tangible to the nation's
production of goods and services.  It is a cancerous growth on
the body politic.  It is an artificial entity created and
promoted by a greedy few to increase their unearned profits and
to increase invalid corporate ownership.  It is bilking on a
national scale with a lot of innocent people the victims, like
the tens of millions of workers whose hard-earned dollars in
pension funds are constantly jeopardized.
<p>
Some day an enlightened society will realize that the entire
Stock Exchange could be unceremoniously relegated to the bottom
of the Grand Canyon and the nation's capacity to produce all
goods and services would not be lessened one iota!
