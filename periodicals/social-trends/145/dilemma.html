<hr>
Two recent books -- <cite>End of Work </cite>and
<cite>Jobless Future -- </cite>confirm the view that much of
the entire world, particularly the US and Canada, is heading
toward a major crisis.
<p>
The principal theme of these books is about the impact that
computerized technologies are having on the world job market.
Frequent announcements are being made of industrial layoffs due
to downsizing and restructuring.  As time passes more and more
companies will become more and more automatic, requiring few or
no workers.
<p>
Replacement of workers by machines is not new.  For example,
from 1919 to the stock-market crash of 1929, one author contends
that productivity (output per person) increased by over 4% a
year, while unemployment rose by 2 1/2 million.  Productivity
has increased consistently ever since.
<p>
The primary motivation for investments in technologies and in
reorganization is to cut costs, chiefly labor overhead.  For
businesses this accomplishment translates into greater
profitability.  Surprisingly, little public attention is given
to the consequences of these actions.  The obvious question that
arises is:  When there are few workers, where is the money going
to come from to buy the technologically produced merchandise?
<p>
One could argue, for now, that unemployment figures are not
very high.  It all depends on who is counting and how it is
done.  The author of <cite>Jobless
Future</cite>maintained that normally published numbers
are greatly underestimated.  Regardless of tallies now,
unemployment will steadily increase in the future.  On January
2, AT&T announced the layoff of 40,000 workers over the next
three years.  The list of recent corporate layoffs is a long
one.  (Recent published unemployment figures for Spain is close
to 25%.)
<p>
Since just before World War II, unemployment in the US has been
kept relatively low due to government intervention.  In the
process, deficits and the Federal debt have skyrocketed.  This
debt, compounded by accelerating interest and entitlement
obligations together with a large military budget, is propelling
the government toward bankruptcy.  While government debt has
ballooned, consumer debt has also bounded up, helping to keep
unemployment down for now.
<p>
As of January 2, 1996, Congress and the White House were
haggling over cuts in order to balance the Federal budget by the
year 2002.  Assuming an agreement is reached, will they both
abide by the provisions of the bill, or will it be a repeat
performance of the one passed in 1985, in which deficits
increased instead of decreasing?  Assuming that they both stick
to their commitments, we then face the other menacing head of
the dragon -- huge shortages of money due to this legislation.
<p>
In 1937 when budget balancing demands convinced Franklin
Roosevelt  to slash expenditures, the economy plummeted,
exceeding the decline rate of 1929.  Enormous outlays for World
War II put people back to work and diverted potential surpluses
from the civilian economy to the military.  So, when the
deficits go, so will the crutch that has been supporting the
economy for much of the last 64 years.
<p>
Even without a balanced budget the US economy is slowing down.
According to the <cite>New York Times News Service,
</cite>retail sales during the Christmas season was one of the
worst since 1988.  Blame was attributed to high consumer debt,
joblessness, and excessive inventories, as well as the weather.
Significant is the fact that inventories are outpacing  the
country's ability to buy. It doesn't take long to reach the
saturation point when incomes are declining and machines are
turning out vast quantities of goods.  In the long run, the Feds
moving to lower interest rates will be futile.  If  one has no
income and no credit, even an interest rate at zero will be of
little help.
<p>
What we face now and in the future has no precedence.  Radical
social change is taking place, not by any ideology, but by
inanimate devices and kilowatts of electricity.  Human beings
who have created robots are now on the verge of becoming victims
of their creations. The anachronism of the technological age
imposed within the archaic debt-driven monetary system is
forcing us to alter our ways of doing business.
<p>
It doesn't take an IQ of 200 to see what is coming down the
pike.  As purchasing power drastically declines, the economy
will head for the basement, probably never to recover.  Survival
will become a real issue for the vast majority of people.
<p>
A monetary solution seems out of the question.  So, what is
left?  A simple but radical solution would be to design a
rationing program in which money is not involved.  Such a
system, called <strong>Energy Accounting,</strong> has been
devised by a group who call themselves Technocrats.  If there
are other alternatives to our present unworkable monetary
system, they should be explored soon.  Time is running out.
