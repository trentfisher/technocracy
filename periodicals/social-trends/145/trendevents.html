<hr>
The Federal Government is not the only one that is
feeling the debt crunch.  Consumers installment debt has reached
the all-time high of about $1 trillion dollars and continues to
increase.
<p>
The credit availability has contributed to a bleak result; an
end to American thrift.  While household debt has soared,
savings are less than half the level they were in the mid 1980s.
The average credit-card debt has reached $3,900, $3,000 more
than 1985.  And consumer installment debt, excluding home-equity
loans and mortgages, is a record 19 percent of after tax income,
higher than before the 1990-91 recession.
<p>
Consumers are stretching out new and used car loans to seven
years, which will mean additional interest costs for the average
buyer.  Personal bankruptcies are nearly triple the levels of a
decade ago, even as a record number of Americans have been
seeking credit-counceling service this past year.  Delinquencies
have risen, and the banks are writing off hundreds of millions
of dollars in consumers' installment loans.
<p>
If the economy gets worse, loan defaults will continue to soar.
And with federal insured banks holding more than $550 billion in
consumer debt, that could put the American taxpayer on the hook
if the banks go bust.  Shades of the S&Ls meltdown when losses
wiped out a thousand savings and loans and hundreds of banks,
costing the American taxpayer billions and billions of dollars.
<p>
The Federal Reserve System has been giving warnings for the
banks to watch and tighten up their consumer-lending practices.
Banks and other credit issuers have made debt too easy for the
consumer.  But the last time the federal government slowed
credit, the nation came away with a recession, and 1987 brought
about another stock-market crash.
<p>
<em>Without the creation of mega amounts of debt, this
monetary and financial system would fall like a house of cards.
Private and public debt is the lubricant that keeps the wheels
of the present economy going or from falling into the abyss.
When the federal government cannot service its debt, sell or
auction off its securities, the day of reckoning will
happen.</em>
<p>
<em>The problem in the United States is that science and
technology has increased production beyond the capacity of the
distributive mechanism, and to correct this imbalance, it is the
distributive mechanism that must be overhauled or scrapped, not
the productive mechanism, and the distributive mechanism happens
to be the monetary civilization.</em>  (Soddy)
<p>
<em>Under the present economic system, it is just as
necessary to supply or provide consumers with the wherewithal or
purchasing power to enable them to consume what is produced.
But the monetary-price system is not designed to cope with the
glut of the productive mechanism.
<p>
It is no wonder and no accident that the U.S. is the
largest debtor nation in the world and has the largest private
and public debt of any other nation in the world.  Without the
creation of debt, where would this economic system be?
<p>
Frederick C. Thayer, a visiting professor at George
Washington University, in an intensive study of the economic
effect of balancing the budget that appeared in the January 1,
1996 issue of <strong>``The Washington
Spectator</strong>'', found that balancing the budget has
resulted in the six real depressions that occurred in the
history of the United States, including the Great Depression
that started in the crash of 1929.  The latter was a depression
that continued until World War II.</em>
