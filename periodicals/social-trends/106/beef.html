<h3>Making ends MEAT--A global concern among experts</h3>
<p>
Are members of the bovine family, namely cows, inheriting more of
the earth than they should in order to give us food?
<p>
There was a time when pork took top place on the meat agenda.
Not only can we enjoy roasts, chops, steaks, soup and stew from
this versatile animal, but its meat can be smoked to make ham
and bacon; pickled pig's feet and head cheese were considered
delicacies; lard, the fat of the hog, was at one time an
important edible fat; its intestines make excellent sausage
casings; its bristles are still used to make long-lasting paint
brushes; pigskin, when tanned, makes beautiful leather
accessories, including the American football; one of its major
achievements is the use of its skin in providing a substitute
skin for burn patients instead of the painful procedure of using
the patient's own skin in the healing process; and the latest
achievement is processing the pig's ears into hard chew gristle
for dogs. Most of us have heard the expression regarding pigs:
``Everything is used but the squeal.''
<p>
The omnivorous pig also makes an excellent garbage disposal for
vegetable and animal debris. Added to all these benefits of the
American swine is its ability to reproduce more rapidly and
mature earlier than any of the other common meat-producing
animals.
<p>
The pig lost first place as a meat producing animal during the
winning of the American West. Pigs just couldn't handle ``pig''
drives. When discovery was made of the resilience of the cattle
over long, arduous journeys across country, cattle ranchers'
taste buds changed accordingly. The push was on to convince
others that beef is where it's at. And that push still thrives
today. After all, the profit derived from raising and selling
beef determines its use, even if it isn't all that good for our
health or the health of the environment.
<p>
Perhaps more damage was done to the environment during the
cattle drives of the last century than at any other time. An
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-sponsored study describes
this history of shame: ``The land was grazed so ruthlessly that
native perennial grasses were virtually eliminated from vast
areas and replaced by sagebrush, rabbitbrush, mesquite, and
juniper. The exposed soil was quickly stripped from the land by
wind and water--unchecked flood flows eroded unprotected stream
banks--subsequently lowering water tables. Perennial streams
became intermittent or dry during most of the year.''
<p>
By the late 1870's, travelers on their way across the plains
could see dust clouds miles away caused by cattle drives from
Texas to railheads at Dodge City and Kansas City. The plains
were torn up; buffalo were annihilated; and the already
disappearing Indian tribes were starved and herded onto
reservations to make way for cattle.
<p>
Harold Dregne, professor of soil science at Texas Tech
University, estimates that 10 percent of the arid west has been
turned into desert by livestock. The  U.S. Bureau of Land
Management (BLM), which is responsible along with the U.S.
Forest Service for overseeing public rangeland, reported last
year that nearly 70 percent of its expansive holdings in the
west were in unacceptable condition.
<p>
And now, every nation that can afford to sharpen its taste buds
for meat, just as the United States has been doing for years.
Imagine five billion people eating the way most Americans do!
There would not be enough land to grow the grain to feed the
animals, not just the cattle, but pork, turkey and chicken also.
<p>
In 1971 Frances Moore Lappe's book, <cite>Diet for a small
Planet</cite> made the best seller list and boasted a million
copies sold. She did an excellent job of chronicling the ratio
of pounds of grain fed to cattle in relation to subsequent
pounds of meat fed to people. Her recipes are nutritious and
would certainly cut down on the waste of grain used to produce
beef for human consumption. But how do you get everyone to
follow these recipes? And even if you could, nutritional food
preparationis expensive unless you grow your own garden. Even
beans, the staple people could afford during the great
depression, are a premium on today's market.
<p>
Mrs. Lappe made some interesting observations in her studies on
our shrinking planet:
<p>
Due primarily to genetic seed improvements and the widespread
use of both fertilizer and pesticides, the productivity of
American farm land increased 50 percent between 1950 and 1971.
But the American economic environment was not ready to receive
the ``good news'' delivered by the breakthrough in the
exploitation of our natural environment. Given the sharp
inequalities in wealth here and abroad, it was impossible to
sell profitably all of our newly enlarged foodresources. Thus
the challenge confronting American agriculture soon became one
of disposal, of how to get rid of it all. By far the easiest way
to get rid of the problem of having ''too much'' was just not to
grow the food at all. Farmers were paid 3.6 billion
dollars to hold land out of production, but even so, crops
reached record highs. An agricultural scientist at Purdue
University had received a state grant to figure out some way to
use up all that food in a nonfood manner. He was not successful,
but the perfect solution was found elsewhere. The American
steer.
<p>
An average steer was able to reduce 16 pounds of grain and soy
to one pound of meat. (The statistics remain the same today.)
The other 15 pounds were inaccessiblefor human consumption. They
were either used by the animal to produce energy or to make some
part of its own body that cannot be eaten, such as hair.
<p>
Livestock other than the steer are considerably more efficient
(see chart): hogs consume six, turkeys four, and chickens three
pounds of grain and soy to produce one pound of meat. Milk
production by cows is much more efficient. In fact, less than
one pound of grain is fed for every pint of milk produced.
<p>
An acre of cereals can produce five times more protein than an
acre devoted to meat production; legumes (beans, peas, lentils)
can produce ten times more; and leafy vegetables fifteen times
more with some plantsin each category producing even more--
spinach, for example, producing up to 26 times more.
<p>
Imagine yourself sitting in a restaurant in front of an eight-
ounce steak and then imagine the room filled with 45 to 50
people with empty bowls in front of them. For the ``feed cost'' of
your steak (1971 prices), each of their bowls could be filled
with a full cup of cooked cereal grains...
<p>
Now, 21 years later, the above situation remains unchanged
except to grow more intense as population increases and more
nations turn to meat consumption for protein. Writing for World
Watch, Alan B. Durning, senior researcher at World-watch
Institute, studies the same situation as France Moor Lappe did
earlier, only he emphasizes the effect our meat-centered diet
has on the air and groundwater (May-June, 1991 issue, <cite>Fat Of
The Land</cite>). Mr. Durning makes some interesting observations
also:
<p>
When most Americans sit down to dinner, they're only a bite
away from unwittingly worsening the environment. The overlooked
offender lurking on their plates--between the potato and the
vegetables--is tonight's steak, pork chop, or chicken breast.
The unpaid ecological price of that meat is so hefty that
Americans, if they aren't careful, could end up eating
themselves out of planetary house or home.
<p>
Animal farms use mountains of grain. Nearly 40 percent of the
world's total, and more than 70 percent of U.S. production, is
fed to livestock, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture
data. Last year, 162 million tons of grain, mostly corn but also
sorghum, barley, oats, and wheat, were consumed by livestock.
Millions of tons of protein-rich soybean meal rounded out the
diet. No other country in the world can afford to feed so much
grain to animals.
<p>
Worldwide, 630 million people are hungry today--because
they're too poor to buy food, not because food is in short
supply. Even if feed grains were given as food aid, hunger might
persist because handouts can flood agricultural markets and
discourage Third World farmers from planting crops.
<p>
American feed takes a lot of energy to grow--counting fuel for
farm machinery and for making fertilizers and pesticides. David
Pimentel, a specialist in agricultural energy use, estimates
that 14,000 kilocalories are required to produce a pound of pork
in the United States--equivalent to the energy in nearly half a
gallon of gasoline.
<p>
Jim Oltjen, professor of animal science at the University of
California, Davis, estimates that half of the grain and hay fed
to American livestock grows on irrigated land. He calculates
that it takes about 430 gallons of water to produce a pound of
pork, 390 gallons for a pound of beef, and 375 gallons per pound
of chicken. Thus the water used to supply Americans with meat
comes to about 190 gallons per person per day, or twice what
typical Americans use at home for all purposes.
<p>
The livestock industry uses half the territory of the
continental United States for feed crops, pasture, and range. On
the half of U.S. cropland growing animal feed and hay, soil
continues eroding at a frightful pace despite recent progress in
conservation. For each pound of red meat, poultry, eggs, and
milk, farm fields lose about <em>five pounds of prime dirt</em>.
<p>
In Central America, beef exports to the United States have
played a part in the tragedy of forest destruction. Costa Rica,
for example, was once almost completely cloaked in tropical
forest, holding within its small confines perhaps 5 percent of
all plant and animal species on earth. By 1983, after two
decades of explosive growth in the cattle industry, just 17
percent of the original forest remained. Throughout the period,
Costa Rica was exporting between one-third and two-thirds of its
beef, mostly to the United States, and it continues to export
smaller quantities today. Producing a single Costa Rican
hamburger involves the destruction of 55 square feet ofrain
forest--an area about the size of a small kitchen. In clearing
that single patch of wet lowland, the Costa Rican forest would
also release as much as 165 pounds of the carbon it naturally
stores into the atmosphere in the form of  carbon dioxide, a
greenhouse gas, according to Sandra Brown, professor of forestry
at the University of Illinois. That's as much carbon as the
typical American car releases in a 20-day period...
<p>
Frances Moore Lappe found the answer to solving these problems
in changing our diet as a first step to taking responsibility
for the future. Shesuggested taking the profit out of life
itself--food. She further suggested a list of organizations to
join to participate in people-to-people development projects.
She also listed magazines to read and films to watch. Mind you,
this was 21 years ago, and the problem grows more severe.
<p>
Alan B. Durning puts his faith in people and nations to do the
right thing. ``Personal decisions to eat foods lower on the food
chain won't suffice without corresponding changes in
governmental codes that  allow the livestock industry to deplete
and pollute resources without bearing the costs. What's needed
is enough citizens demanding that lawmakers take aim at the
ecological side-effects of meat production. If the global food
system is not to destroy its ecological base, the onus will be
on rich nations to shift from consumption of resource-intensive
food stuffs toward modest fare.''
<p>
Both Lappe and Durning recognize our technological capability to
produce enough food for all people. Lappe talked about abundance
and how it was impossible to sell it all; she told how farmers
were paid not to grow. Durning talks about the millions of
people going hungry, not because food is in short supply, but
because they are too poor to buy it. Both try to solve the
problem of abundance with the same system that spawns inequities
in the food chain. The elimination of money and the installation
of a system of measurement would solve the problem of abundance.
If we don't begin conserving our natural resources, abundance
will decline to sufficient and gradually work its way on down to
insufficient.
<p>
<h3>EDITOR'S COMMENTS:</h3>
<p>
Letters-to-the-editor of World Watch magazine varied following
Alan Durning's article. One writer complained because Durning
hadn't shown concern over the suffering of the animals on
factory farms. (That is another horror story.)
<p>
A Texas writer, perhaps a cattle rancher, took Durning to task
and labeled his approach to sustainable animal husbandry extreme
and unreasonable, pointing out the advantages of beef in
providing protein in our diet. He also pointed out the progress
being made in soil erosion control and a preferred solution of
making local food production possible rather than giving food
away and increasing dependency. (In New York City, for instance,
the poor could plant a garden in their window boxes, if they
could afford the seed.)
<p>
Many beef cattle ranchers, like loggers in the Northwest, have
never known anything else. This is how they make their living.
Naturally they will defend over-grazing cattle for food, just as
loggers defend clear-cutting the forests, regardless of damage
to the health of the environment and the subsequent damage to
<strong>our </strong>health.
<p>
Technocracy leads the way with its solution for eliminating the
terrible waste of natural resources. The least common
denominator  of all goods and services is energy. Technocracy
offers an Energy Accounting design that would not only measure
production and consumption in accordance with human needs,
creating a balance in distribution (see enclosed Information
Brief), but it would also eliminate the need for money, which is
a measure of nothing.
