The recent presidential election brought people to the polls in
droves (if you consider a 57% turnout a successful voter's
drive). They were fed up with the way things were going. Clinton
and Gore promised change. (So did Ross Perot, but he got
straddled on the political fence and couldn't get off.) And
change it is. This is the first time a president and vice
president have been elected who haven't experienced World War
II. This is the first time two men from the ``baby boom''
generation hold the highest positions in the nation. President
Clinton patronizes McDonald's, and the White House pet is a cat
instead of a dog. No one can argue that this isn't change.
<p>
Our new Attorney General made a name for herself right off the
bat by supporting the FBI's ``peaceful'' tactics in removing the
Branch Davidians in Waco, Texas, which ended in a fiery hell for
those still holed-up in their compound after federal tanks
penetrated the building. And President Clinton, quite nobly,
took all the responsibility. As usual, the government, the
Attorney General, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)
hung together, with the help of the news media, even though the
facts on this grisly event weren't in yet. But there is change
here. The Attorney General is a woman instead of a man.
<p>
There is talk about cutting military spending. Will we go into
Bosnia with ``surgical strikes'' on another
``peace-keeping'' mission?
<p>
Associated Press, April 23, 1993,
headlines: <em>Clinton hints at air strikes against
Serbs.</em> We've changed from Iraq to former
Yugoslavia, although former President George Bush made sure that
the new president would inherit his war with Saddam by ordering
the cruise missile attacks on Iraq just a few days before Clinton
was to take office. So Clinton inherited Bush's war in Iraq. He
faced a military policy not of his choosing, one difficult to
make decisions on. And he is in a precarious position,
considering his anti-Vietnam War stance while in college. He must
show his clout on this one. No waffling. Of course, the
noticeable change here is in presidents. From Bush to Clinton.
Same war over oil.
<p>
Now before President Bush left office on a note of grace, he
made about the only effective change of his career. After
calling his opponents bozos in the debates, he spoke kindly of
his successors and urged the people to support their new
leaders. The change came when he ordered all white House
personnel to quit, walk out right at noon on January 20th.
Usually the staff stays on to welcome the newcomers and show
them the ropes. Nice guy. Oh well, there is a first time for
everything, and we can't accuse Bush of not bringing about
change, even if it was at the last minute.
<p>
There are changes in our outlook on Russia, too. In 1918, she
was our enemy. ``Down with the Bolsheviks!'' But Russia won out
and American businessmen, along with other countries that
invaded Russia at the time, were foiled in their attempt to get
at Russia's resources.
<p>
In World War II, we changed our tune, and Russia became our
ally, along with France and England, against Japan, Germany and
Italy. We secretly hoped that Hitler would beat Russia and then
we could go in and beat up the Germans in their weakened
condition, and then we could subdue Russia in her weakened
condition. (Isn't that the reason we stalled for two years
before giving Russia the second front she so desperately
needed?) Neither scheme worked. Russia won the war against the
Germans; again American businessmen were foiled in their attempt
to get at Russia's resources.
<p>
Then, after World War II, we did another switch-a-round, and
Russia once again became our number one enemy. What would happen
to our economy if we couldn't have a cold war against those
dirty commies and manufacture arms? So we kept this communist
scare thing going until both Russia and the U.S. were up to
their eyeballs in debt.
<p>
Then we had to find a scapegoat for this terrible debt that was
sinking our ship of fortune--and fools. No, not war in Korea or
our long, ugly war with Vietnam, or our other little wars here
and there. Nor was it the cold war with Russia. Nor uncontrolled
government spending. Nor subsidizing the real welfare cheats--big
farming (such as tobacco) and the military. Nor the
Iran/Contra arms trade scandal. Nor the S&L scandal. Nor
leveraged buyouts.  Nor uncontrolled government spending. Nor the
rape of our environment to accommodate business conglomerates at
home and abroad. No, the real reason for our downfall are those
social programs that desperate people need because society has
passed them by. And then there are those greedy old Social
Security geezers who helped bring us to the edge of economic
disaster. Never mind that Social Security is an insurance
annuity, not a government gratuity. Now we commoners all should
be willing to make sacrifices in the name of government over-spending
and business exploitation. Ask not what your government
and big business can do for you. Keep an eye open for what they
can do to you.
<p>
Well, we love democracy so much, we want Russia to have it too.
President Clinton will go to any lengths--and seemingly any
expense--to bring change to Russia. Howard Scott, founder and
director-in-chief of Technocracy Inc., once said that if we
wanted to ruin Russia, all we had to do was send over 10 astute
American businessmen. Once again his predictions are coming
true. At last American businessmen have that long awaited
foothold in Russia, and events there--they are changing. They
resemble the American way more every day: crime, poverty, street
people, misery... Three pips and a big hurrah for democracy.
<p>
On the campaign trail, Bill Clinton promised changes in forest
management, health care, gay rights, the economy, the military,
child care, foreign relations, jobs, and so on and so on, ad
infinitum. The only thing he has been able to change so far is
his mind. He inherited a mess. Whatever decision he makes will
be the wrong decision for someone, some group, somewhere. If he
doesn't shuffle the deck right, he can expect no cooperation
from the republicans, who are looking to pad their own security.
Politics is not for the people. Politics is for the politicians.
And no matter how sincere and intelligent our leaders may be,
they fail the people because they can't make a broken-down,
outdated system work by using the same methods that are bringing
this nation to its knees in the first place. Might as well hitch
up your broken-down-car to a mule to get it moving again.
<p>
Why keep changing the man? Why not change the system to a viable
entity that works for the benefit of all, not just the elite.
Only then can we talk about bringing change to the people. Sound
impossible? Maybe. But how do we know until we've tried?
