<p>
For several decades we've had the technological expertise and
sufficient resources to design a house of tomorrow that is:  (1)
durable enough to last the maximum time possible with a minimum
of physical maintenance cost; (2) fireproof and strong enough to
withstand every normal stress and strain but light enough to be
easily handled; (3) abundant and cheap enough from an energy
standpoint to house the entire population of the Continent
without straining natural resource supplies.
<p>
In 1938 Technocracy gave us a glimpse of a home of the future.
Wood as a building material was not durable enough and required
too much human labor in construction to justify its use.  Bricks
and stone were too heavy to handle and likewise required too
much human labor in constructing a house, not to mention
creating a serious earthquake menace with their lack of
flexibility.  Chromate, copper and nickel failed to pass
resource requirements as there weren't enough of them in the
world to house a small part of the 150,000,000 people then
living in North America.
<p>
At that time only three or four materials filled the necessary
requirements for Continental housing from a technological
standpoint.  Glass came first.  It was made chiefly from
silicon, the second most abundant element in the earth's crust.
It filled the requirements of strength and durability and could
be fabricated in the form of glass wool or bubble-glass, both of
which were light weight and provided almost perfect insulation
against heat and sound.  The housing industry could have turned
out almost unlimited quantities of strong, light-weight,
flexible, durable, honeycomb glass panels that would have been
an ideal construction material.
<p>
Technocracy proposed concrete as a second possible material, not
as it was known then but in the form of a thin, honeycomb panel
of solid concrete filled with a recently developed concrete
"foam", which was soundproof and heatproof.  Such panels would
be strong, yet lightweight and easily handled and could be
cheaply turned out by mass-production methods, answering the
requirement for an abundance of material sufficient to rehouse
the entire continent.
<p>
The third possible material suggested was aluminum because it
was one of the three most abundant elements in the earth's crust
and also filled the requirements of strength, durability and
lightness.  It's only drawback at that time was the energy cost
of producing the metal that undoubtedly "could have been
overcome by the development of mass-production methods."
<p>
Technocracy's proposal for the fourth possible material of the
"house of  tomorrow" was some form of 20th Century "plastics."
Plastics could be obtained from wood and
<p>
waste farm products, both of them replaceable resources.
Plastic materials had possibilities that were only just then
becoming recognized.  The energy cost of production was rather
high and there were several other drawbacks at that time to
using plastics as a building material but, as Technocracy
pointed out in 1938, "with the development of mass-production
techniques--this material may eventually supplant all other
materials derived from non-replaceable resources."  Today we can
see how far the use of plastics has advanced!  In some instances
plastic is a threat to our environment because of its durability
(disposable bottles, disposable diapers, etc.), but handled
intelligently it could be one of our most valuable replaceable
resources due to its efficiency, durability and low-energy
costs.
<p>
Undoubtedly other efficient housing materials have been brought
to light through scientific research, but model houses featured
then and now are nothing more than glorified salesrooms that
deplete nonrenewable natural resources unnecessarily, promote
cheap gadgetry instead of energy efficiency, and seldom offer
real comfort or convenience.  For those who have the money,
showmanship is the name of the game.  For those who must settle
for mediocrity, the house begins to fall apart before the
hapless owner can realize the first payment on the principle.
Yet, up until now the value of even a mediocre house tended to
increase through the years that made it a good investment,
especially for the middle class.
<p>
However, the time when the value of a house appreciates while
the structure actually depreciates is fading away.  The American
Dream for many homeowners has become a nightmare.  Although
education systems and parents still try to instill the value of
hard work and owning a home in the young, the children of today
weren't born into an era of "good times" brought about by a
World War II.  They are facing a challenge many of their parents
haven't come to terms with yet:  the technological age where the
efficient kilowatt hour replaces man hours.  With jobs on the
decline, where will purchasing power come from?  For adults to
blame the youth of today for drug abuse, drinking, lack of
interest, crime increase, and escalating suicide rates without
seeing themselves in the cataclysmic picture as well reveals
their extremely selfish bias toward keeping the events of
yesterday the same.  They  want their children to toil because
they had to toil.  They cannot tolerate the thought of them
living in a good house without having to slave away 45 years of
their lives for it, perhaps then to realize it really doesn't
belong to them after all.  Many people can't hang onto these
homes on retirement income because of high taxes and the high
cost of maintaining a house.
<p>
All these years we could have provided adequate housing for all
North Americans without it being a burden to them.  Ask
political leaders from Franklin Roosevelt's time on why they
chose not to share North America's abundance of natural
resources with all citizens as their birthright.  This
phenomenon continues today while people bed down in the streets
and under bridges.  We, the North American citizens, are
allowing it to happen as we resign ourselves to the social
attrition perpetuated by our leaders who care more for profits
than energy conservation and the welfare of their country's
citizens.
