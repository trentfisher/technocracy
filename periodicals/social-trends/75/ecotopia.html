<p>
As is invariably the case with most writers who attempt to solve
our serious social problems with either fiction or nonfiction,
Callenbach can't exorcise money, politics and voting from his
mind, so his mythical social scheme would be destined for
failure if taken seriously.  But not in fictional Ecotopia.
<p>
Three states secede from the nation of United States:
Washington, Oregon and California.  They adopt one name,
Ecotopia, derived, one assumes, from ecology and utopia.  In the
beginning their separation brought cries of treason, and U.S.
helicopters mercilessly attacked them, but due to Ecotopia's
ingenious technology and raw courage, this small nation wins the
helicopter war.  <strong>The Mouse That Roared!  </strong>Only
unlike this fictional screenplay of a small, financially
destitute country off the coast of France that attacked the
United States with bows and arrows, reasoning that it would lose
the war against such a powerful nation and then be rehabilitated
by the victor, Ecotopia miraculously rehabilitates itself.  A
generation later this island unto itself remains self-
sufficient, having nothing to do with its neighbor, the United
States, although it does associate with certain foreign
countries--on its terms.
<p>
It is interesting to note that the author chose his Ecotopia
where water flows in abundance; climatic temperature ranges are
not too severe; sufficient resources provide citizens with a
good life, although they are strictly monitored; forests thrive,
especially in Oregon and Washington; some of the best farmlands
can be found in all three states; and Ecotopia enjoys easy
access to major waterways.  Now suppose the author had chosen
Oklahoma, Kansas and Nebraska for his Ecotopia.  It would have
been a different story but most interesting to see how these
three centrally aligned states survived after seceding from the
nation of United States.
<p>
Mandated into law are reforestation programs and protection of
existing timber; like India's sacred cows, trees are entitled to
protection and respect.  Just to show you how sacred these trees
are,  the citizens of Ecotopia prefer most structures to be
built of wood.  A few unusual "recyclable" plastic houses dot
the landscape, but wood dominates the scene.  Even some bicycles
sport wooden stands, a mark of distinction.  Commendably,
Ecotopians recycle everything, even their clothes (no synthetic
fabrics here).  In fact, wearing home-made garments is
encouraged;  who exactly will inherit this time-consuming chore
from days of yore remains a mystery.  At least it wasn't
mentioned in the story.
<p>
"How good it is to see stars, even in the cities," says the
protagonist, William Weston, an investigative journalist for the
Times-Post in New York City, who was sent to Ecotopia on an
assignment, the first outside reporter to be allowed into this
unusual sanctuary since it gained its independence.  And what is
the reason for all this pure air?  There are no fossil-fueled
cars, just electronic vehicles.  Since the great helicopter
battle, no planes fly over Ecotopia.  Walking and bicycling are
encouraged.  Water transportation consists of excursion boats
from here to there and back again.  Some trucks are in operation
to haul furniture and various other heavy items.  But fossil-
fueled vehicles other than these trucks are forbidden.
<p>
If the author, who shows genuine concern over a deteriorating
environment, had considered this serious problem on a
continental scale, as all thinking North Americans should, he
would realize that you can't secede three states from the rest
of the nation--or continent--and expect to halt environmental
degradation.  The scale is too small.  Pollution spreads across
the continent, and eventually the world, with no
<p>
respect for boundaries; its contagion touches all life support
systems.  The Columbia River, which flows between Oregon and
Washington State, its vast mouth opening into the Pacific Ocean,
its source in another nation to the north fed by other bodies of
water, does not honor borders just because earlier primitive
modes of travel instigated marking off existing county and state
lines on a map.  Our present era of immediate communication and
high-speed transportation makes these boundary lines obsolete.
And in Ecotopia, voting areas have been cordoned off into even
smaller factions than in the United States, purportedly to bring
about more "community spirit."
<p>
And what a good life for women!  One has been elected president
even, as if changing gender for the highest office in the land
would make politics more effective or women more respected.
There is absolutely no prostitution because of communal living
and open sex.  (No mention is made of venereal diseases.)  And
after much research, women get to choose the man whom they deem
worthy of fathering their children.  Jealousy, or rivalry, is
virtually unheard of.  (Part of this story seems to center
around "Women's Lib" as the author would like to see it.)
<p>
Everybody in Ecotopia accepts abortion as one solution to
population control--after a long debate.  How simple.  No family
planning programs.  No abortion clinic bombings.  No wild
demonstrations.  No voting.  No sex education classes.  Just
conduct a lengthy debate and get rid of the abortion
controversy.  Also, Ecotopian citizens came to the agreement
that additional children, that is to say more than are needed to
round out a family, are more of a burden than an advantage in a
highly advanced industrial society.  On the other hand, they all
believe in free and open sex.  It is no big deal to walk down
the avenue and find a couple copulating beneath a sacred tree.
(The Oregon spotted owls would have a bird's eye-view, assuming
that Ecotopians managed to save this endangered species from the
greedy logging companies that had attempted to cut the old
growth timber, which is this adorable, fluffy, eye-blinking TV
personality's habitat.)  And now that the over-population threat
seems to be solved in Ecotopia, its citizens are encouraged to
participate in family farms again  (???).
<p>
Education in Ecotopia seems to be about as ho-hum as usual with
field trips resembling Girl and Boy Scout functions.  At an
early age, children learn the ethics of hard work.  Never mind
the technological age that gave Ecotopians the 20-hour work
week.  But then Ecotopians blame technology for ecological
imbalance, not its misuse.  (Here we have a pro-gun type
mentality in reverse:  People don't kill the environment;
technology kills the environment.)  One difference in education
here is the schools are managed and controlled by the teachers.
To a great extent the children are being taught with methods
resembling those in the United States with the only emphasis on
math being how to earn a living.  Sound familiar?  And with
teachers in control, what happens to the infamous bureaucracy of
superintendent, principal and PTA?  With the elimination of the
holy three and teachers in control, it is more than likely that
parents will be expected to be seen but not heard, at least not
too loudly.  One thing to be said for teachers here is they see
the importance of diversion from boredom.  Children are allowed
more physical liberties than in the United States.  One supposes
by this the author means that children won't be strapped to a
desk all those hours but will have breaks that rest their minds
while exercising their bodies, a break for teachers as well.
<p>
Although wildlife must be hunted with bows and arrows, people
can own guns.  Violent war games take place where Ecotopian
citizens are occasionally killed and often wounded by spears,
the only weapons allowed in this cozy little activity.  War
games take the place of competitive sports, you see, tempering
all that violence so inherent in human nature, even replacing
the need for war.  Conversely, sports are based on personal
initiative rather than on incentive as is common in the United
States.  Evidently war games also take the place of violence in
sports.
<p>
Crime in Ecotopia is at a minimum, making the streets safe for
citizens, although embezzlement and fraud crop up occasionally.
You know how Price Systems are.  One reason for the reduction in
crime is there are no restrictions on growing or smoking pot,
and the government curbed drug traffic by taking it over as a
monopoly.  And the reason government here enjoys beneficial
reforms is because of voluntary measures.  Just what these
voluntary measures are and who volunteers for them seems a
little obscure.  Ecotopians don't worry about income, sales or
property taxes.  A land tax seems to cover it all.  Those who
earn more recognition because of valuable contributions to
society will be allowed to work less than the 20-hour week to
make up for it.  (No mention is made of human-hours versus
machine-hours.)  And a guaranteed minimum wage keeps even the
laziest citizen from abject poverty, although 20 hours of work a
week will boost wages above the poverty level, so incentive
continues to play a big part in Ecotopian life--except in sports
of course.
<p>
Supervisors in the job force respect their workers and often
take advice from them.  Why?  They are elected to their jobs and
want to keep them--not picked for their qualifications.  So the
only change here is a reversal in status quo, making workers no
more compassionate than their overseers were in the past.
<p>
Scientists are not paid for their advice as this would only
corrupt them.  How they make their living remains a mystery.
Why they prefer to stay in a small nation that doesn't respect
them is an even bigger mystery.  And why single out scientists
to not get paid for advice?  Why not politicians, insurance
agents, lawyers or psychiatrists, the modern-day witch doctors?
<p>
Some Ecotopian body of thought came to the decision that, by
employing standardization, products can be manufactured so they
are long lasting and easily repaired; that there is no reason
why Ecotopian vehicles couldn't be automated entirely due to
standardization and its resultant simplification.  (Don't look
now, but we're talking about science and its capabilities
through engineering expertise.)
<p>
Hospital treatment certainly seems more humane, more caring, and
so different from what we have come to expect.  Each patient has
a nurse of the opposite sex assigned expecially to her, or to
him, for the entire time spent recovering while in the hospital.
Our hero, injured by a spear in a war game, never ceased to be
amazed at the beautiful nurse provided him who sat at his
bedside, massaging him periodically.  All kinds of titillating
things happened during his recovery.  One can't help but wonder
if the same procedure applies to everyone--say octogenarians--or
suppose our patient had been assigned a 250 pound middle-aged
hardliner ready for retirement.
<p>
Even Van Gogh and Picasso take second seats to Ecotopian talent,
which is encouraged and always comes first.  Although most
Ecotopians have record collections, they will not go out of
their way to hear a famous group if one of their own is
performing at the same time.  It's amazing how these Ecotopians
got to be a nation of sheep in such a short time.  But what a
boon this would be for new talent who find it extremely
difficult to compete with Beethoven, Chopin, Picasso, Elvis
Presley or other long-ago artists.
<p>
So William Weston left his ex-wife, two children and girlfriend
to live with the beautiful Marrisa (not his nurse) who chose him
to father her children.  Of course his children in the United
States will have visitation rights in Ecotopia.  Since this is
fiction and anything goes, one must say this for the author:  He
is endowed with a terrific imagination.
<p>
What is unimaginable is what Ralph Nader, Consumer Advocate, has
to say about this book:  "The book's impact...is the breadth of
perspective that envelops the reader.  None of the happy
conditions in Ecotopia are beyond the technical or resource
reach of our society."  This from an intelligent man who ignores
factual evidence on social trends offered to him for
investigation by Technocracy's supporters, even though this
evidence has been brought to his attention more than once.
Instead he supports fiction that is wrought under a silly Price
System where citizens never cross the boundaries of Ecotopia in
pursuit of a better life, even though they could make more
money--fiction at its ultimate.
<p>
The author molds his territory with a mixture of obsolete
methods of social management and technological advancement.  The
only other internal combustion engine to be let into Ecotopia
besides service trucks was the taxi that transportated William
Weston 20 miles into Ecotopia--and only if the wind was blowing
in the right direction.  But Ecotopians enjoy an intelligent
magnetic-levitated train system.  For the most part, though,
Callenbach glosses over the vital problems that confront any
society with simple-sounding solutions.  Some problems seem to
have reached their solution by the stroke of an Aladdin's Lamp
to produce the problem-solving jinni, or its equivalent magic
wand.
<p>
But then in the United States we have our Star Wars program and
news media horoscope and astrology hoopla columns, full-page
articles featuring Sasquach and UFO sightings, not to mention
some of our best scientists still pursuing outer space for
intelligent life.  In the meantime our educational systems
corrode into political institiutions where the pursuit of profit
seems to be the only learning worth while.
