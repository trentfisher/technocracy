At a time when new methods of education regarding birth control
should head our priority list, news headlines read differently:
<p>
<em>Answered prayers; six babies in 14 months:</em>
Spokane, WA.--"Two years ago a woman prayed she would
have a baby.  Now she has her wish six times over.  After taking
a fertility drug, she gave birth to quadruplets in June 1992.
(This past August, she and her husband had twins, not due to
fertility pills.)
<p>
"The mother took Clomid, a drug that stimulates the pituitary
gland to produce hormones needed for ovulation.  Seventeen weeks
into her pregnancy, she developed gestational diabetes, and her
legs atrophied so much she could barely walk.
<p>
"The quadruplets spent four weeks in intensive care.  The
mother's health insurance covered nearly all the medical costs
of almost $400,000.
<p>
"The lucky parents are not without help.  They live with the
mother's parents, and all four grandparents and a part-time
nanny pitch in with the chores.  Cribs and strollers and donated
time from coworkers, neighbors and friends help to ease the
burden."
<p>
(Excerpted from <cite>Associated Press</cite>, 12-28-93)
<p>
<em>Woman has twins--at age 59:</em>  London--"A 59-year-old
British woman gave birth to twins on Christmas Day, becoming the
oldest woman on record to have a child.  She was artificially
impregnated with eggs from a younger woman.  She will be 69 when
her daughters are 10 years old.  The British woman was turned
down for fertility treatment by the ethics committee, which
ruled she was too old for the emotional strain of pregnancy.
But she refused to give up and consulted an Italian doctor who
specializes in helping women who have gone through menopause
have children.  He has helped 35 women aged 48 to 55 to become
mothers."
<p>
(Excerpted from <cite>Associated Press, </cite>12-27-93)
<p>
<em>Excerpted from Dear Abby:</em>  "...I have agreed to become
a surrogate mother for a married woman who has unsuccessfully
tried to have a baby for 10 years.  The egg and sperm will be
the other couple's; they are just using my body as an incubator.
<p>
"I will be paid $5,000 when my pregnancy is confirmed, and
$5,000 after the baby is born.
<p>
"Abby, your column isn't long enough to describe the emotional
abuse my mother has put me through since all this started.  She
asked me if I had lost my mind and made it clear that she didn't
want to see me in this condition with someone else's baby."
<p>
<em>Abby's answer:</em>  "Surrogate motherhood is not about
renting one's womb; it's about helping a woman fulfill her dream
of motherhood."  (December 28, 1993)
<p>
In spite of extensive scientific studies that have proved that
overpopulation puts a serious strain on our natural nonrenewable
resources, and in spite of the studies that show explicitly that
if this trend continues, our resources will not be able to
sustain such a burden, doctors of science are coming up with
exciting ways to give childless couples not just one child but
twins, quadruplets, quintuplets.  The waifs already born and
living in poverty hardly get a glance, but just let parents
produce multiple births and the helping hand is out.  The media
plays up the importance of such a stupendous occasion in grand
style.
<p>
A doctor of science can now help over-age women have babies by
impregnating them with a younger woman's eggs.  Twins yet.
Never mind the mother may not remain in good health to raise her
children.  She may not even live to see them grow up.
<p>
And there is no end to the innovations of the Price System.  To
make a little extra cash, productive surrogate mothers are
helping other parents build up their ego by producing their very
own child whose seeds have been implanted inthis surrogate's
womb.  Abby calls it helping a woman fulfill her dream of
motherhood.  If there were no money involved, would the
surrogate mother be so helpful?
<p>
In the case of the parents of quadruplets and twins, just
imagine an insurance company paying the expenses of parents who
purposely get themselves in a bind.  That $400,000 would have
gone a long way in helping six babies already here and in need.
Of course, the intelligent way in this age of information would
be to not produce unwanted babies and to limit family production
to replacing the parents.
<p>
Scientists could use their expertise in improving life already
on planet earth instead of searching for it in the heavens.
Always we are searching for and praising new life instead of
seeing the importance of improving life for those already here.
Without a qualm, we send our best minds and bodies to war and
then extol the virtue of an unborn fetus, its future status
unknown.
<p>
Isn't it time that we stop trying to emulate an unprovable
ancient history book by not going forth and multiplying and by
not subduing the earth?  We're talking about survival here.
