The following are short biographies of the sixteen men and one
woman whose research led to the concept of Technocracy and the
social design of science--the concept of the Technate of North
America, which would be the world's first functional society.
<p>
The research and study by the Technical Alliance (New York, NY,
1918-21) marked the first time in history anywhere in the world
that a country or a Continent was objectively examined and
analyzed on a functionally multidisciplinary and
interdisciplinary basis,  not as nations and their people have
always been compared and rated--and still are--on the basis of
their political economic/financial ideology, their military
forces, and their philosophical premises.  Instead, the
Technical Alliance measured and assessed the extent of the
land's natural resources of soil, metals, fuels, hydrology and
its energy resources, its transport and communications and
construction capabilities, its industrial and technological
productive capacity, its available scientific, engineering,
biological trained personnel--all to determine whether this
Continental area could provide an equitably individualized high
optimum standard of living for its population, and if so, how
this could be brought about.
<p>
The following are excerpts from a definitive Technical Alliance
pamphlet:
<blockquote>
<p>
...to survey the possibility of applying the achievements of
science to social and industrial affairs.
<p>
...to work out a tentative design of production and distribution
completely coordinated, production defined as manufacturing and
furnishing of goods and services necessary to satisfy the wants
of man (in) given standards of comfort.
<p>
...engineering estimates of production processes: material
specifications, plant locations, related industries, and
distributing methods; estimates given in qualitative and
quantitative terms: of machine hours, pounds, cubic feet, ton-miles,
heat units, etc.
<p>
...to put the technical knowledge of the country at the service
of the people so that industry may be released from the present
chaos imposed...by arbitrary rule of extraneous non-technical
(financial/political) control.
</blockquote>
<p>
<h3>MEMBERS OF THE TECHNICAL ALLIANCE:</h3>
<p>
FREDERICK L. ACKERMAN, Architect (1878-1950):  Designed the
Administration Building of Cornell University at Ithaca, New
York, his alma mater.  During World War I, he was Chief of the
Housing & Town Planning Design Division of the U.S. Shipping
Board; later a consultant for the New York City Housing
Authority; Fellow of the American Institute of Architects;
member of the American Institute of Planners; lecturer on
architecture for Cornell University, Columbia University; member
of New York State Board for Registration of Architects.
<p>
Ackerman wrote the opening chapter for the official Technocracy
booklet:
<a href="../../../pamphlets/intro.html">Introduction To Technocracy</a>
<p>
ALLEN CARPENTER, M.D.  (No further information.)
<p>
CARL L. ALSBERG, Biochemist (1877-1940):  Chief, Bureau of
Chemistry, U.S. Department of Agriculture; Director, Stanford
Food Research Institute; Dean of Graduate Study, Stanford
University.
<p>
LOUIS K. COMSTOCK, Electrical Engineer ( - 1964):  A member of
the War Industries Board in World War I; Chairman of the Board
of Review of the War Production Board in World War II; head of
L.K. Comstock Company, New York Electrical Contractors, that had
responsibility for planning and coordinating the wiring and
lighting for the 1939 New York World's Fair.
<p>
STUART CHASE, CPA (1888-1985):  Author of many books on the
importance of industry and technology in America; also books on
the semantics of language.
<p>
ALICE BARROWS FERNANDEZ, Educator (1879-1944):  Teacher of
English at Vassar College and at the New York Ethical Culture
School; fellowship student of John Dewey, originator of the
work-study program for secondary schools in the United States;
senior specialist in school building problems for the U.S.
Office of Education from 1919 until retirement in 1942; member
of executive committee of National Federation for Constitutional
Liberties; author, <cite>Functional Planning for Secondary School
Buildings</cite> (1937); daughter, granddaughter and great
granddaughter of Congregational Ministers; niece of Thomas B.
Reed (Rep., ME, Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives,
1888-1899) with whose family she lived.  A precept of Reed was,
``The level of liberty in any land is the liberty of its meanest
[lowest] citizen.''
<p>
One of Fernandez's contributions to the Technical Alliance was
the concept of a small electric power generator to be built into
and in full view in the central lobby hall of every public
school and college/university in North America.  It wasn't meant
to be merely a museum piece; symbolically it would demonstrate
the dynamic operating prime mover that provides the electrical
energy serving that entire educational system...the lighting,
cooling and heating apparatus, communications, etc.  All
students would thus be aware, every day, of this functionally
operational reality symbolizing our human/social interdependence
with technical energy in the North American way of life whether
they were first graders, high schoolers or post-grads, and
whether they were studying to be physicians, musicians,
biologists, artists, or engineers, et al.  Their teachers
likewise would benefit from this learning experience.  The top
half, or all of every turbogenerator unit, would be
operationally in full view at all times.
<p>
BASSETT JONES, Mathematical Technologist (1877-1960):  Planned
the installation, operation, and timing sequence for the 73
elevators (and their 1,515 miles of wire cables) in what was to
be the world's highest building--the Empire State Building--
elevators capable of moving 15,000 people vertically up its 102
story stops during a 30-minute morning period, and 15,000 people
down during the afternoon 30-minute rush hour.  (In 1945, a
twin-engined bomber, fogged in, slammed into the building, the
jolt setting a floor afire and causing the cables of one
elevator to snap.  It fell 75 stories...the two women passengers
were brought out injured, but they were not killed.)
<p>
Jones was chairman of the Elevator Safety Research Committee of
the American Standards Association; he supervised the
installation of the first self-service elevators in an office
building.  A consultant in lighting, he designed the first
floodlight units used in a theater (for Maude Adams of the
Washington Square Players in ``Peter Pan'', 1912), and he planned
the illumination for the United States Military Academy at West
Point, the Riverside Church in New York, and the Corcoran
Gallery in Washington, D.C.  As a consultant for the Comstock
Company, he made the grounds of the New York World's Fair look
like ``a fairyland at night, the buildings glowing from within
instead of being spotlighted'' (N.Y. Times).  Also, he was co-
inventor with Clarence Birdseye of what is now enjoyed in
virtually every American and Canadian home:  quick-frozen foods.
<p>
SULLIVAN W. JONES, Architect (1878-1955):  Secretary of the
Technical Alliance; became State Architect of the State of New
York; designed the State Office Building in Albany.  During
World War II, he was Chief of Housing for the War Production
Board; in 1946 he was consultant on veterans' hospitals for the
Chief of Engineers, U.S. Army.
<p>
ROBERT D. KOHN, Architect (1870-1953):  Became president of the
American Institute of Architects; designed the Montefiore and
Mt. Sinai Hospitals, R.H. Macy & Co. department store, and the
New York Ethical Society meeting house.
<p>
BENTON MACKAY, Forester-Naturalist (1879-1975):  Originator of
the Appalachian Trail, 2,025 miles from Mt. Katahdin in Maine to
Springer Mountain, GA  (model for the newer Pacific Crest Trail,
2,560 miles from U.S.-Mexico border to Canadian border); was
with the U.S. Forest Service.  It is estimated that a million
Americans hike on the Appalachian Trail every year.  Author of
<cite>New Explorations:  A philosophy of Regional Planning</cite> (1962)
and <cite>From Geography to Geotechnics</cite> (1968).
<p>
LELAND OLDS, Statistician (1890-1960):  Director of research for
the American Federation of Labor; assistant to the chairman,
then executive secretary of the New York State Power Authority;
Chairman of the U.S. Federal Power Commission; Vice Chairman of
the National Power Policy Committee; member, President's Water
Resources Policy Commission; Chairman, U.S. St. Lawrence
Advisory Committee until the St. Lawrence Seaway and
Hydroelectric project was completed, which was, as Senator John
F. Kennedy pointed out, ``... a permanent memorial to him... He
had the vision and the energy to establish the foundation for
the giant power system that will soon be serving America.''
<p>
HOWARD SCOTT, Engineering Scientist-Technologist (1890-January
1, 1970):  The multidisciplinary scientist-technologist-engineer
who, in his late 20s, brought the Technical Alliance together.
Members of the Alliance chose him as their Director and Chief
Engineer to coordinate their research.
<p>
CHARLES PROTEUS STEINMETZ, Electrical Engineer (1865-1923):
Known as the ``Wizard of General Electric'', he created and
controlled lightning--artificial yet with the same flashing
crash and destructiveness as Nature's lightning--so he could
devise electrical equipment to more effectively withstand
uncontrollable natural lightning.  During his career, his
inventions won him more than 200 patents, creating practical
solutions to the enigmatic problems of magnetism and alternating
current; his work became the springboard for much of the vast
electrical industry used today.  There was no way to mass-
produce electric motors or generators and no practical way to
transmit electric energy more than three miles...until Steinmetz
discovered the laws of hysteresis in 1892 when he was 28.  He
read a paper on it before the American Institute of Electrical
Engineers...in 1901-2 they chose him as their president.  When
giving him an honorary degree, President Charles W. Eliot of
Harvard University, said:  ``I confer this degree upon you as the
foremost electrical engineer in the United States, therefore in
the world.''
<p>
``Charles Proteus Steinmetz, the man who did most to tame
electricity to consumer use, had such a formidable intellect
that even Einstein marveled at it and sought him out.  People
everywhere are indebted to him every time they flip a light
switch, plug in an electric shaver, turn on a television set...''
(Life Magazine, April 23, 1965.)
<p>
``Because he was born with a hunch back, Charles couldn't run and
jump like other youngsters.  But when he got old enough to
hobble to school, he made a pleasant discovery:  His mind could
run and jump.  He sprinted through all the math and science and
engineering that could be set up for him.  After hours, he
dabbled in a new field that nobody expected to amount to much:
electricity.
<p>
``Eventually, he came to America to look for a job...It wasn't
easy at first.  People would see his disappointing body and say
that they'd let him know if something came up.  But one day he
found a man who let him talk.  People who remember Charles
Steinmetz say that when he talked about the subject he loved, he
grew tall and beautiful before your eyes...turned loose in a
good laboratory, the results he came up with helped to remake
American life and industry.  You need long words to describe
what Steinmetz did.  He was a scientist's scientist.  You might
say he pinned electricity down on a table, fired questions at
it, cut it up, found out what made it tick, and set down the
rules for making it behave.  Since then, anybody who has done
anything useful with electricity has worked with tools that
Charles Steinmetz made for us.  To many people of his day, he
was, above all, the man who defeated lightning.  Lightning had
always done terrible damage to power lines.  It paralyzed
factories, plunged cities into darkness, then ran away before it
could be studied.  Steinmetz made lightning in his laboratory,
looked it in the eye, and tamed it.''  (From an institutional
advertisement of John Hancock Insurance Co.)
<p>
Steinmetz:  ``Some day we make the good things of life for
everybody.''
<p>
RICHARD C. TOLMAN, Physical Chemist (1881-1948):  Taught at
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of Michigan,
University of Cincinnati, University of Illinois; Director of
the Fixed Nitrogen Research Laboratory; Professor of Physical
Chemistry and Mathematical Physics and Dean of Graduate School,
California Institute of Technology.  During World War II,
appointed to the National Defense Research Committee; when
President Roosevelt named Vannevar Bush as Chairman, the other
members of the Committee chose Tolman as Vice Chairman; member,
National Academy of Sciences; Fellow, American Academy of Arts
and Sciences; author, <cite>Statistical Mechanics with Applications
to Physics and Chemistry.</cite>
<p>
JOHN C. VAUGHAN, Surgeon (1875-1940):   Chief of Vanderbilt
Clinic; instructor in surgery at College of Physicians and
Surgeons, Columbia University; Director, Bellevue Hospital;
Chairman, American Birth Control Society; Medical Director,
Workers Health Bureau; Fellow, American College of Surgeons;
author, <cite>Textbook on Minor Surgery.</cite>
<p>
THORSTEIN VEBLEN, Educator and Author (1857-1929):  Taught
Economics and Finance at Cornell University; Political Economy
at University of Chicago; Economics at Leland Stanford
University and New School for Social Research.  Managing Editor,
``Journal of Political Economy.''  In his classes and textbooks,
exposed and analyzed the ``conspicuous consumption'' of cultural
waste and the technical inefficiency inculcated by economics'
deliberate obsolescence of products as well as interference-
control of education.  Author of <cite>Theory of the Leisure Class</cite>,
<cite>Theory of Business Enterprise</cite>, <cite>Instinct of
Workmanship</cite>, <cite>Higher Learning in America</cite>,
<cite>Vested Interests and the Common Man</cite>, and others.
<p>
CHARLES H. WHITAKER, Architect (1872-1938):  Editor, ``Journal of
the American Institute of Architects''; Director of the Regional
Planning Association of America; author, <cite>What is a House?</cite>.
<p>

<p>
JOSIAH WILLARD GIBBS (1839-1903):  Professor of Mathematical
Physics at Yale University.
<p>
Professor Willard Gibbs was the engineering scientist whose
Phase Rule united physics with chemistry...which had previously
been considered separate and incompatible entities by the
world's scientists.  The result?  What is now know as physical
chemistry--basic to chemical engineering.
<p>
The Phase Rule applies the thermodynamics of energy to calculate
and predict the changes (transformations) from a liquid (phase)
to a gas to a solid--or in reverse or in any combination,
whether the material is metal, air or more complex gases, water
or more viscous liquids (like petroleum), chemicals, mineral
ore, or even organic/biologic substances.  It is recognized as
``the most important single linear equation in the history of
science,'' and as the ``Rosetta Stone of science.''
<p>
``...Gibbs defined new quantities related to entropy, which
allowed him to predict in advance whether or not a chemical or
physical change will take place; and if it does, how far it will
go.
<p>
``...Gibbs' famous Phase Rule grew out of these studies.  He
devoted only four pages to its development...within the next 50
years (after 1878) other scientists wrote books and monographs--
a total of 11,000 pages--on Gibbs' Phase Rule, describing
applications to mineralogy, petrology, physiology, metallurgy,
and every other field of science...''  (Excerpted from <cite>American
Science and Invention</cite>, Mitchell Wilson, New York, NY.  1955.)
<p>
Just as Isaac Newton founded the science of mechanics, Willard
Gibbs created the science of physical chemistry--combining
physics with chemistry--to which all other branches of chemistry
become subordinate.  Within 50 years after Gibbs' work,
chemistry had pervaded the world's greatest industries.  Steel
had become a matter of chemistry, along with the baking of
bread, the making of Portland cement, mining, manufacture of
petroleum fuels...
<p>
When awarded the Copley Medal in 1901, the highest honor
bestowed by the Royal Society of London, he was cited as ``the
first to apply the Second Law of Thermodynamics to
the...relation between chemical, electrical, and thermal energy
and capacity for work.''
<p>
In the view of the American Chemical Society, Professor Gibbs
was ``the greatest theoretical scientist this nation has ever
produced.''
<p>
He was ``...the man who put chemistry on its engineering
feet...who proved that nothing is so practical as a sound
theory.''  (-Waldemar Kaempffert, Science Journalist, writing in
the New York Times, December 13, 1942.)
<p>
``If in the field of music, Wagner could say `I believe in God
and Beethoven,' then surely, in the field of thermodynamics, one
should say, `I believe in God and Gibbs.'''  (-Professor Robert
Gilmont, adjunct professor of chemical engineering, in
frontispiece of his book, <cite>Thermodynamics for Chemical
Engineers</cite>, N.Y., 1959.)
<p>
The operational techniques of statistical mechanics and vector
analysis (calculating magnitude with direction), both of which
Gibbs developed and formulated, are involved in many
applications of engineering today.  His vector analysis helped
make radar possible.
<p>
Lee De Forrest, whose invention (1906) of the audion tube took
wireless out of the Marconi dot-dash era into the spoken word of
modern radio, which then led to television... was one of
Professor Gibbs' students.
<p>
Gibbs was the first American to win a Ph. D. in Engineering.
<p>
He was the second American to receive a Sc. D. Doctorate in
Science.
<p>
He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1879, and
two years later delivered his Vice Presidential address to
fellow members of the American Association for the advancement
of Science.
<p>
In the view of historian Henry Adams (1838 to 1918), grandson of
President John Quincy Adams, he was ``the greatest of Americans,
judged by his rank in science.''
<p>
``Our intellectual and scientific forefather was Willard Gibbs,
the thermodynamicist,'' acknowledged Howard Scott of the
Technical Alliance and Technocracy whose Theory of Energy
Determinants--the operational dynamic of functional social
design on a Continental scale of magnitude for North America--is
largely derived from Gibbs' discoveries.
