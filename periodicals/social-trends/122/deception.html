The use of deception is not a recent phenomenon. It has been around for
a long time. It is a technique that politicians, diplomats, cold warriors, spin
doctors, salesmen and other snake-oil promoters use to deceive the unsuspecting
and gullible public. Even the experts in the art of deception are not immune to
fooling themselves and overplaying their hand.
<p>
Case in point: The revelation that the Pentagon attempted to fool the Soviet
Union into thinking that the United States had an advanced missile defense
system. While with some reservations, the Pentagon has now admitted that the
high-sounding and costly Strategic Defense System (SDI) was merely a ruse, it
claims that through its deception, Star Wars was the straw that broke the back
of Soviet communism.
<p>
While the explanations (deception?) coming from the Pentagon have been
ambiguous when it comes to SDI, there are reports that the Pentagon (and
cohorts) rigged the test to make it appear that SDI was feasible and had a
practical potential for development and application. Billions of dollars have
been and continue to be spent on this dud.
<p>
According to Senator Jim Sasser (D-Tennessee), the chairman of the Senate
Budget Committee, $30 billion has been spent on Star Wars in the last eight
years. This has been the result of the traditional log rolling and pork-barrel
deals that go on in the halls of Congress and behind the scenes. With all of
this talk about balancing the national budget, one would think that this white
elephant (SDI) would have joined its mammoth ancestors long ago. Yet, the White
House plea of $3.4 billion for the continuation of SDI was only reduced to $3
billion by Congress. And to add insult to injury, the money for SDI will double
next year and stay at a $6 billion level until the end of the century!
<p>
The purpose behind SDI has been to provide lucrative contracts for the
aerospace industry. The defense system of the United States has never been for
deterrents and containment of communism but for profits and maintaining huge
military expenditures as a means to prevent the present economic system from
collapsing.
<p>
Since World War II, ``national security'' has become the instrument of
deception to divert the attention of the country and the American
people away from the magnitude and severity of the nation's domestic
problems. As a result, America has been prevented from implementing a
transition or conversion plan toward a viable, balanced-sustainable
economy--from war and destruction to peaceful and meaningful pursuits.
