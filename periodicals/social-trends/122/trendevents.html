It is interesting to note that Russia's road to <i>democracy</i> and
<i>capitalism</i> has run into a number of potholes, road blocks and detours.
The transition from a state-controlled Price System to a capitalistic Price
System of privatization has been anything  except smooth and has fallen on hard
times and taken on many of the characteristics and problems of a financial and
monetary system.
<p>
Russia, with its economy in dire straights, has been admonished by the Western
nations that loans from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank will
not be forthcoming unless it can get its economic act or system in order. Yet
Russia, in an attempt to move its economy toward privatization and a market
oriented economy, continues to run into many of the pitfalls that are now
plaguing the industrial nations of the world. (The United States is calling for
a democratic state of private enterprise and a market oriented economy, yet the
United States, if it is an example, has the dubious honor of being the largest
debtor and trade deficit nation in the world.)
<p>
Maybe all is not hopeless for Russia and the Russian people. Here was a nation
of republics that took the brunt of World War II and turned back the onslaught
and siege of fascism in a crucial period of world history. During the most
adverse conditions, Russia was able to dismantle, move and reconvert over 2000
of its plants and equipment beyond the Urals and out of reach of the fascists'
military forces. For a nation of republics that had the most devastation and a
loss of over 20 million of its population during and from the aftermath of
World War II, it was resourceful enough to rebuild and reconstruct its
infrastructure and industrial complex (without the aid of the Marshall
Plan).
<p>
The fact that the Soviet Union could do all of the things that have been
mentioned during and after World War II shows there is no reason why Russia, in
cooperation with the now independent Republics, cannot implement a transition
or conversion plan where her resources, technology and expertise are mobilized
to meet the present exigency as well as for useful and meaningful purposes when
the conditions for such a transformation are more favorable.
<p>
Just to create another breed of Nomenclatura elite, millionaires and
billionaires, and join the multinationals in the exploitation of Russia's
remaining resources for merely capital gain and personal aggrandizement,
American or Western Style, and be led down the path of deterioration that comes
from plutocracy does not speak well of its leadership nor the future of Russia
and its people. To allow the wheelers and dealers from the West to get a
foothold in Russia would be the worst thing that could happen to Russia and the
Russian people. Their destiny lies in Russia and the contiguous area of the
region.
<p>
Like America, Russia needs a new breed of leadership with inventiveness and
imagination that understands what must be done to break completely from the
status quo of the past and the present; and she needs to refuse to let a
fictitious created piece of paper or a mere promissory note get in the way of
implementing a new economic system and method of operation that is based on
physical reality.
