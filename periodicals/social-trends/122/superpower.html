<hr>
How many times have we heard and read that the United States is the only nation
that has all of the essentials and the necessary requirements to meet and deal
with the myriad of problems that beset today's world.
<p>
We are forever being told and reminded within the United States and from
abroad that America is the only superpower in the world today. The
pronouncements to that effect come from many sources, including the highest
officialdom of the United Nations, heads of state of various countries
(especially those receiving foreign aid and having their debts forgiven), from
past and present government officials, and a number of exponents of the
academic, business, financial and industrial establishment.
<p>
The list of supporters (or is it promoters?) that have jumped on the
superpower bandwagon seems to be endless.  Nevertheless, while there is
beginning to be more criticism of the brouhaha that appears in the media on the
subject, hardly a day goes by that there isn't some reference to the
superiority and capabilities (unlimited) of the United States as the sole and
major arbiter in the affairs of the world.
<p>
There are editorials and articles in the leading publications with the theme
that the United States has the obligation and the responsibility to take a
leading role in the affairs of the world, even involve itself in the
sovereignty or internal affairs of another country (nation building),
underwrite the adversity of nations and engage the United States in the
conflicts (hot spots) that are forever breaking out over the globe. Not to be
left out, the power brokers and the cold warriors of the containment and
``deterrent'' period are still advocating the peace in strength strategy for
America in the post Cold War era.
<p>
With the end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the former Soviet Union,
the United States remains as the only superpower left in the world, so we are
told. It is as if in the new world order, the United States has become the
center of the universe. One might conclude that reality, as usual, has been
pushed aside, and the malady that comes from delusions of grandeur has again
prevailed.
<p>
What does it mean in the new world order where the United States becomes the
predominant player in the scheme of things? What is really behind the rhetoric
and the polemics? And is America in a position to step up and lead the world
out of its present malaise? And if America does not lead the way in this great
crusade, will the world be the worse for it and disintegration follow? There
are those interests that claim that the United States is the one country that
can make things right in the world, and if it doesn't accept this obligation,
it will be a dereliction of responsibility and, as a result, America's
credibility will be jeopardized.
<p>
What do the advocates really mean when they say that the United States must
lead the way in the crusade for a new order of things? Are they speaking of an
extension of the old order of things in attempting to solve world problems
through the use of military power or might? It looks very much as though this
is what they mean. Even with the end of the Cold War, the United States still
has the largest military arsenal in the world and is still the leading nation
in the production and sale of arms, amounting to billions of dollars annually.
And its addiction to huge defense expenditures has no end.
<p>
Considering that no military threat exists now that the Warsaw Pact has
disbanded, the resurrection of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
gives the wrong message and purveys what direction the "new" world order will
take. As the only designated superpower, supposedly with all of the essentials,
the United States will be expected to provide most of the military weapons and
personnel, contribute a substantial part of the foreign and humanitarian aid
and the largest amount of its natural resources, technology, industrial
production and know-how in the process. As in the Cold War when the United
States spent $10.5 trillion on defense and arms while the other industrial
nations gained the technological edge, there is no doubt that America's
competitors for world markets (fair-weather friends and enemies) will be
goading and cheering from the sidelines as the U.S. continues to bleed itself
white and hastens its own demise.
<p>
Contrary to the contention by the superpower brokers and other vested
interests that America is the only superpower in the world, and it must be
concerned and take the leading role in the affairs of the world, the United
States is not in any position to police the world nor does it have the
wherewithal to deal with or meet the ongoing conflicts and the needs that
plague this world of over 5 billion people. It is a rationale that could bring
further disintegration and increase the vulnerability of America's
technological and resource base, its infrastructures and environmental habitat
that all life forms depend on for their very existence.
<p>
While there was a time when the United States had a lion's share of the known
natural resources of the world, it finds itself far from being sufficient in a
number of resource categories because of its wanton depletion and voracious
consumption of the country's remaining resources. With about six percent of the
world's population, the United States consumes thirty percent of the world's
resources. From waste and the production of obsolescence, wars and its
destruction, the misuse of its technology, neglect and deterioration, the
United States lacks a number of critical minerals that are necessary in the
operation of a high-energy and technological mechanism.
<p>
As a matter of fact, in the last 50 years the per capita consumption of
minerals in the United States has multiplied 15 times. The U.S. has consumed
more minerals from 1940 to 1976 than did all humanity up to 1940. In 1940, the
population of the United States was 131.6 million people; now it is about 250
million people with a projection by the Census Bureau that there will be 20
million more people living in America by the end of this century. And by the
year 2050, the nation's population will probably increase by more than 50
percent, to 383 million people. The implications and ramifications of this
trend overshadow everything else and make the superpower syndrome insignificant
and inconsequential by comparison.
<p>
There is no validity to the contention that America is a superpower. It
is nothing more than a myth, concocted by the power brokers and special
interests who are concerned only with maintaining the status quo of the
financial and monetary structure and their advantageous positions under the
present economic system regardless of the consequences to the country and the
American people. If the United States of America cannot put its own house in
order, how can it possibly lead or show the way to the rest of the
world?
<p>
As long as the American people allow the superpower brokers and the "inner
circle" to determine the policies and the direction the country is to take and
to continue to divert the attention of the public from America's real  social
and economic problems, the possibility or opportunity of the country ever
starting to put its own house in order will be as elusive as ever.
<p>
We have only ourselves to blame if we allow these interests and this
bankrupted financial and monetary system to continue to deplete and destroy the
country's remaining natural resources and become involved in the quagmire of
the world's insoluble problems. There is no reason why America can not
implement a transition toward a new social and industrial order and face up to
its past and present short-comings and proceed in a new direction with a
workable and functional system that is compatible with physical reality. This
must be America's first and most important priority.
