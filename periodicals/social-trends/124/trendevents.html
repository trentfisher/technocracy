In article by Stephen L. Goldstein brings out the fact that America's
poor and needy get very little consideration from their elected
representatives in Congress or from the Administration in
Washington. He maintains that the disadvantaged and poor would get
more help from the U.S. Government by fleeing to Myanmar (Burma).
<p>
Goldstein goes on to state that historically American sympathy for
people in distress increases in direct proportion to the distance they
are from America's shores. &quot;We have no tolerance for poor people
in America,&quot; Goldstein reiterates throughout his essay.
<p>
Goldstein thinks that if America is going to save the world and
Restore Hope in Somalia, it should resolve to save America and
Americans. America has over 32 million people living at or below the
poverty level and a like number of Americans on the edge of poverty,
and millions of children (our future citizens) who go hungry and
without the basics for life.
<p>
Goldstein also wants to know how come the nation cannot find a
proverbial dime to help those Americans who have lost their jobs
because the power brokers in Washington and the captains of industry
botched the economy.
<p>
Of course, having no real answers to the
social and economic problems that confront the nation, the poor
brokers in Washington and the inner circle find it more expedient and
convenient to divert the attention of the American people to countries
thousands of miles from American shores. In this way, the country can
never come to grips with its own problems, always diverted by wars or
the myriad of problems that beset the world. regardless of what
happens in other parts of the globe, the United States needs to START
now to mobilize all of its resources and technology to put its own
house in order.

<h1>Gridlock And Bottlenecks South Of The Border Down Mexico Way</h1>
<p>
In article by Sam Howe Verhovek (New York Times 11/30/93) points out
that all of the euphoria over the celebration of the North American
Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) may be premature as the quantity of
imports and exports of goods and services increase between the United
States and Mexico.
<p>
Verhovek dwells on the fact that trade between the two countries along
both sides of the 2000 mile border has already created many
problems. he brings out that the infrastructure is not
adequate&#151;that the bridges, roads and customs stations are already
overburdened and in no condition to handle any expansion of trade that
is contemplated by the United States and Mexico in the future. If
traffic is already in gridlock, what will it be by the year 2000? He
points out that the situation as it exists now.
<ul>
  <li>In Laredo, the busiest crossing over the Rio Grande, the number
      of trucks heading south has jumped from 185,000 in 1987 to
      800,000 last year&#151;or more than 2000 a day.
  <li>Trucks are lined up for a mile and a half&#151;two miles some
      afternoons just waiting to cross the bridge.
  <li>There are physical barriers&#151;clogged roads, bridges and
      strained customs and immigration checkpoints that will only get
      worse.
</ul>
<p>
The idea of privately operated toll roads has been proposed to meet
the problem. While transportation officials of the four border states
of Arizona, California, New Mexico and Texas have drawn up ambitious
schemes for more bridges and super widened highways, nobody knows
where the money will come from to build them. These states are already
in a budget bind and can't even take care of their own infrastructure,
which has deteriorated over the years from neglect.
<p>
As for the border cities of Mexico, they are among the poorest cities
in Mexico. President Carlos Salinas has promised the citizens of
Mexico 12,000 miles of new super highways to be built by private
companies who will be guaranteed a percentage of the tolls for their
investments. (Can you imagine some investment banker or entrepreneur
dumb enough to get involved in something like this without a guaranty
from the government?)
<p>
Those cities and the people who reside on both sides of the border
feel that NAFTA makes no provision for the human element and their
needs such as potable water, sewer lines and facilities, health care
and a plan to curb pollution, which is already at intolerable levels.
<p>
It must be obvious that NAFTA is just another one of those schemes
concocted by the power brokers in Washington without any comprehensive
plan or foresight. As usual, under the present financial system, the
transnationals, the banks, the investment brokers and the elite of the
United States and Mexico will be the major beneficiaries of this
venture. The consumer and the taxpayer will get the hindmost.
