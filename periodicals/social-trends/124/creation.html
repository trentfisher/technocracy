<p align=center><i>In the beginning was the plan</i>
<p align=center><i>And then came the assumptions</i>
<p align=center><i>And the assumptions were without substance</i>
<p align=center><i>And darkness was upon the faces of the workers</i>
<p>
<i>And they spake unto their Group Heads, saying: ``It is a crock,
and it stinketh!''</i>
<p>
<i>And the Group Heads went unto their Section Heads and sayeth:
``It is a pail of dung, and none may abide the odour
thereof.''</i> 
<p>
<i>And the Section Heads went unto their Managers and sayeth unto
them: ``It is a container of excrement, and it is very strong,
such that none may abide by it.''</i>
<p>
<i>And the Managers went to their Director and sayeth unto him:
``It is a vessel of fertilizer, and nonce may abide its
strength.''</i>
<p>
<i>And the Director went unto his Vice-President and sayeth: ``It
contains that which aids plant growth, and it is very strong.''</i>
<p>
<i>And the Vice-President went unto the President and sayeth unto
him: ``It promoteth growth, and it is very powerful.''</i>
<p>
<i>And the President went unto the Chairman of the Board and sayeth
unto him: ``This powerful new plan will actively promote growth and
the efficiency of the Company.''</i>
<p>
<i>And the Chairman looked upon the Plan and saw that it was
good. And the Plan became policy.</i>
