Most of us are familiar with the old fairy tail of Cinderella and how
her fairy godmother, in order to give her one evening of pleasure,
changed a pumpkin into a beautiful golden coach, drawn by six white
horses transformed from mice and complete with coachmen and
footmen. Cinderella, we remember, went to the king's ball, beautifully
gowned, and she had the time of her young life. There was only one
catch to it&#151;she had to leave before midnight, because promptly at
that time all would be changed back to its original state. The
beautiful coach would be only a pumpkin; the horses would again become
mice; and Cinderella herself would return to her chimney corner. But
Cinderella was having such a wonderful time that she forgot to watch
the clock and it was FIVE MINUTES TO MIDNIGHT when she realized it was
too late to get home before everything would be gone. But you know the
rest of the story. The next day Cinderella had nothing left but the
memory of a wonderful time.
<p>
The story of Cinderella makes an interesting comparison with the
attitude of most North Americans, entranced by the make-believe of a
paper moon over a cardboard sea and wistfully hoping it will last
'till the wells run dry and the mountains disappear. Today, when all
signs point to the imminence of the greatest economic crisis in our
history, a few heed the warning; a few realize that the time is at
hand&#151;that the hour is about to strike.
<p>
So look out, Cinderella. Your counterpart in the fairy tale had a
deadline set on her fun, and so have you! Whether you realize it or
not, your fun is limited. At the stroke of midnight, your fun, too,
comes to an end. Your beautiful golden coach of war prosperity will
vanish with the signing of the peace treaties, and tomorrow you will
have nothing left but the memories of a perfectly lovely
&quot;binge.&quot;
<p>
For many years Technocracy has been preparing for the machine age and
has been pointing out to the people of this Continent the nature of
our problems and how they can be met successfully. So for all you
modern-day Cinderellas, think:
<p>Not Produce for profit, but Produce for Function
<p>Not Sell to the Market, but Distribute to Consume
<p>Not Financial Resources, but Natural Resources
<p>Not Medium of Exchange, but Medium of     Distribution
<p>Not Booms and Depressions, but Balanced Load    Operations
<p>Not Business Methods, but the Scientific Method
<p>Not More Postwar Promises, but More Goods and    Services
<p>Not Political Machinery, but Functional Sequences
<p>Not Decision by Opinions, but Decision by Facts
<p>Not Dictatorship of the Proletariat, but Dictums of    Technology
<p>Not Class Warfare, but Mass Social Action
<p>Not Equality of Birth, but Equality of Opportunity
<p>Not The Nobility of Labor, but Energy and     Technology
<p>Not The Right to Work, but The Opportunity to    Consume
<p>Not Security in Old Age, but Security from Birth to    Death
<p>Not Pie in the Sky When You Die, but Abundance    Now
<p>Not Private Right and Privileges, but The General    Welfare
<p>Not Free Enterprise, but Free Technology
<p>Not Sovereign States, but Mechanics of Area    Operations
<p>Not Geopolitics, but Geotechnics
<p>Not Chiselocracy, but Technocracy
<p>Not Back to Normalcy, but Forward to the New America
