Imagination. How important is it? Most of us believe we have
imagination, but how often do we put it to work for us? Do we even
think about it? If we let our imagination idle, how can we understand
what others feel: their frustrations, their fears, their joys, their
wants, their needs; how can we understand what we feel or what we
would do in an adverse situation?
<p>
An Avon lady once said she found that her well-off customers were much
more thoughtful and polite than her customers who lived in poor
neighborhoods, in rundown rentals, and who owned old beat-up cars or
owned no car at all. She further said that it seemed as though the
poorer the housewife, the more she put on airs as though she was
&quot;above me.&quot; this puzzled her. Evidently her imagination lay
in limbo.
<p>
S.I. Hayakawa used his active imagination when he wrote the first
chapter in his excellent book, <b><i>Language in Action</i></b>, first
published in 1939. He gives an interesting hypothetical case of two
communities and how differently each handled the unemployment
problem. In <b>A-town</b> the city legislators as well as the
unemployed had been brought up to believe that anyone could find a job
if he tried hard enough. since many people remained unemployed, even
those who searched diligently for work, the city legislators, being
kindly persons, did not want to see these unemployed persons and their
families go hungry. So they set up a &quot;self-respect&quot; program
that was sure to get people off relief. The moral disapproval of the
community would be at work at all times. Suggestions were made to
print the unemployd's' names at designated intervals or to take away
their vote until their shame brought them to terms with their own
negligence. Surely they would be grateful for the small income
provided them, an income they didn't have to work for. Undoubtedly
they would do anything to get off relief.
<p>
But there weren't enough jobs to go around. The people on relief
became more and more disrespectful; they accused the city legislators
of snooping; they claimed that they were just as good as anyone
else. Some of them committed suicide. Many of them went into crime to
make money rather than accept relief from those who demoralized
them. Besides, there was more money to be make in crime. Many wound up
in jail. Family relations deteriorated. Long-time friendships
failed. Children were ostracized at school by their peers. 
<p>
These ingrates proved to the upper crust of <b>A-town</b> that giving
people something for nothing demoralized them. <b>A-town </b>became
divided into the &quot;haves&quot; and the &quot;have-nots&quot;,
which brought about class hatred.
<p>
Then there was <b>B-ville.</b> One alderman convinced his peers that
unemployment,  sickness, accident, fire, tornado, or death, hits
unexpectedly in modern society, irrespective of the victim's merits or
deserts. He further convinced them that <b>B-ville's</b> homes, parks,
streets, industries and everything else the village could be proud of
had been built in part by these same people who were now
unemployed. Why not consider the work they had done for their village
as a premium paid to their community against a time of misfortune. And
why not consider monthly payments to them now as insurance claims
against their misfortune.
<p>
A ceremony took place in <b>B-ville</b> where the first checks were
presented with much positive fanfare, making the recipients of the
insurance claims feel much better about themselves as newly unemployed
citizens. Their children did not suffer abuse at school from their
peers. No one committed suicide. They did not feel as though they were
failures. Crime became nonexistent. And the city legislators were
looked upon with respect by these citizen policy holders.
<p>
Of course, Mr. Hayakawa's intention in writing this book was to point
out the importance of language and understanding it and the importance
of making others understand it. But his &quot;story with a
moral&quot;, as he calls it, also says a lot about the human condition
and about mental and behavioral characteristics of individuals and
groups.
<p>
Any perceptive person can see that <b>A-town</b> hints at our own
unfair system where the unemployed and the underemployed, through no
fault of their own, are looked down on. Some of these people will
never be employed again, especially those who are just under the
retirement age&#151;too young for pension benefits or Social Security
and too old to be employed by companies looking for younger employees
so they can pay them less for their &quot;inexperience.&quot; And as
technology advances, more jobs disappear, so why aren't we insuring
these citizens against hard times as their birthright?
<p>
People just can't imagine the connection between crime and
despair. Perhaps some of these unemployed people, like the desperate
ones in <b>A-town</b>, would rather take a chance on going into crime
for sustenance and possibly landing in jail rather than suffer the
degradation of peer pressure. At least in jail they would have a roof
over their heads, paid for by the same taxpayers who probably could
never imagine the advantages of <b>B-ville's</b> social insurance
program, not only to the unemployed but to themselves as well.
<p>
And how does our government want to handle the problem of crime? Build
more jails. Hire more cops. Three strikes and you're out. With enough
media hype to convince them, the citizens would rather spend more of
their tax money to support a bigger prison system, put more cops on
the beat and more of its citizens in jail than on getting to the
source of the problem and possibly abolishing it altogether.
<p>
Suppose you walk into a supermarket and take in the overall picture of
its contents. Look at all that food. In fresh produce or the meat
department, what happens to the excess food that doesn't sell? Is it
offered to the hungry, or do they have to dig it our of dumpsters
after it is tossed out? Can you imagine yourself being surrounded by
all this good food while you go hungry because you don't have the
money to buy enough food to sustain yourself? Can you imagine the
anger that might build up in you? Especially since you are not lazy,
but there just isn't a job available?
<p>
And the nonsense on TV. Advertisements of the good life abound.  Most
sitcoms portray comfortable living quarters in nice homes where
everyone has plenty of food to eat and more than enough clothes to
wear, even in single-parent homes. Poverty doesn't exist in
sitcoms. You can tell because everyone is deliriously happy. The poor
who view these lies know they are lies, so you can imagine the
frustration building up in them.
<p>
While so many people look down on other people who can't make it in a
vicious system that provides for some but not for others, they think
nothing of the really big welfare recipients gobbling up their tax
dollars: oil, automobile, S&amp;L's, big-time farmers, defense,
retired military personnel, retired politicians and more. How many
taxpayers complained about this juicy tidbit, excerpted from Parade's
special Intelligence Report, 5-19-91:
<p>
&quot;Congress has authorized $60,000 for two gold medals, to be
sculpted by the U.S. Mint for General Colin L. Powell and General
H. Norman Schwarzkopf. Powell is chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, and Schwarzkopf is allied commander in the Persian Gulf.&quot;
While Congress shells out appropriations for meaningless baubles, our
people go hungry.
<p>
With our advanced technology and our dwindling, but still sufficient
natural resources, we can distribute enough goods and services for
everyone on this Continent. Why aren't we doing it? An equitable
distribution system for North America and the exchange of the value
system for one of Measurement, insuring security form birth to death,
would eliminate most crimes practically overnight, and false pride in
maintaining a work ethic in an era of diminishing jobs would gradually
disappear. Imagine that!
