During one episode in Voltaire's comedy classic, Candide, his
main character came upon a strange land called Eldorado where
gold meant nothing to its inhabitants, prisons were unknown, and
a palace of science filled with mathematical and scientific
instruments replaced "royal" ballyhoo and idol worshiping.  No
lawyers or courts of law threatened the populace as there was no
need for them.  Because the citizens of Eldorado enjoyed a
decent standard of living, they readily adapted to their
environment.  But Candide believed that if he returned to the
best of all possible worlds, he could buy his way back to his
lost lady love with the gold and diamonds that lay in abundance
in Eldorado and were his for the taking.  In a land where
citizens shared the resources, there was no use for such
trinkets.  The good king of Eldorado didn't try to detain
Candide but bid his scientists and engineers to build him
something for transportation that fitted his needs in order to
overcome treacherous mountain passes.  Once Candide returned to
the best of all possible worlds where everything happens for a
good reason, his gold and diamonds lured the most unsavory
characters who robbed him at every turn.
<p>
By the time Candide found his beloved Cunegonde, she had aged
beyond belief from trying to cope in an anti-social environment,
and he found himself considerably less prosperous.  Yet they
married and lived out their lives in this best of all possible
worlds, ignoring the security offered them in the land of
Eldorado.  Things aren't much different today.
<p>
Voltaire exposed the hypocrisy of his times over 200 years ago.
If he foresaw the importance of government by science before the
technological revolution, why is it taking the citizens living
in the midst of this revolution so long to wake up?  They are
surrounded by technology that enhances their lives every day of
the year from preserving food to bringing instant services in
travel, communication and entertainment.  They take these
marvels for granted, ignoring the fact that today's social
problems, by force of circumstances, must one day yield to
scientific solutions just as food preservation, travel,
communication and entertainment problems were solved and
improved upon through the use of scientific study and
implementation.
<p>
Citizens will go into a trance of ecstasy when listening to a
presidential contender making promises he knows he can't keep;
his constituency should recognize this deceit if they have any
sense of history.  But the more the politician bleats out what
his sheep want to hear, the better are his chances of keeping
his lucrative job.  And his sheep want to believe that
everything that happens, good or bad, is not only inevitable in
this best of all possible worlds but necessary--this in the face
of irrefutable scientific evidence to the contrary--so they go
on, naively planning for the past while enjoying today's
technological advancements.
<p>
Until the last few decades, social customs more or less directed
citizens' lives from birth to death according to gender.  Baby
girls wore pink.  Baby boys wore blue.  Girls were made of sugar
and spice and everything nice.  Boys were made of snakes and
snails and puppy dog tails.  Little girls emulated their mothers
while little boys were expected to walk in their father's
footsteps.  Primers pictured little girls impeccably dressed in
frills and button shoes, playing with dolls and dishes and
cookware in preparation for their adult life.  Little boys were
pictured with smudged faces and hands, playing ball, down on
their knees shooting marbles, or helping dad with strictly male
chores, also in preparation for their adult life.  Early primers
gave credence to the "everything nice" and "snakes and snails
and puppy dog tails" jingle.
<p>
Providing for the family fell to the man.  Caring for the
household became the woman's lot, and if she wasn't respectably
married by her 20th birthday, consider her an old maid.  The
euphemism of bachelor attached to unmarried men gave them a
certain distinction.  Biological juices turned on at the sound
of "eligible bachelor."  Never for "eligible old maid."  Such
was custom deeply instilled in past generations.
<p>
Then along came the biggest fund raiser of all times that
changed our lives:  World War II.  Not only did sweet prosperity
come to many people who had never tasted it before, but also it
was the beginning of women's lib.  They were needed in factories
to boost the war effort.  For many it was a first out-of-home
job.  They earned as much as $30 a week while our gallant young
warriors, the cream of the crop, fought and risked life and limb
for $30 a month.  (And those who provided the war got rich.)
Few of these participants knew what the war was all about.  Fill
them full of patriotic propaganda, and they'll follow you
anywhere.  Besides, the new breed of workers rejoiced at the
prospect of earning all that money.
<p>
Studs Terkel, in his oral history of World War II, called it
<strong>The Good War.  </strong>(Technocracy calls it
capitalizing on calamity.)  Prosperity reigned for some.  While
we sold arms and munitions to Germany and scrap metal to Japan,
some of it came back to us in the bodies of our dead and
wounded.  Funeral establishments and coffin makers thrived.  And
there actually are human byproducts of that unconscionable
period in time who long for the "Good War" again.
<p>
After World War II, women stayed in the work force.  They traded
their frills for designer jeans.  But prosperity is once again
disappearing around the corner.  It often takes both mom and pop
working in order to survive.  Now we have single parent
households, unmarried men and women sharing the same household,
babies out of wedlock, and marriage seems to be going out of
style, customs be damned.  "Old maids" have come into their own-
-the single woman.
<p>
Jonathan Swift in his delightful spoof on the times,
<strong>Gulliver's Travels, </strong>pointed out that thousands
of people would rather suffer death than dishonor the edict put
out by the emperor of Lilliput on breaking the smaller end of
the eggs first; this edict came about after the emperor cut his
finger once while breaking the egg on the larger end first.  But
is this fictional tale so far fetched?  Only a few years back
peace talks couldn't get started because the participants had
trouble reaching a decision on the proper shape of the
conference table:  Should it be round, oblong, rectangular, L-
shaped, U-shaped...decisions, decisions.  And today important
political decisions are still being discussed--and occasionally
made.  Should the banana slug be made the official state mollusk
in California?  In Florida the House voted to make key lime pie
the official state pie.  The Massachusetts House has passed and
sent to the Senate a measure naming the tabby cat the official
cat of the commonwealth.  Let's hope the various legislatures
act on these vital issues.
<p>
Meanwhile, back in the real world...financial insecurity and
joblessness spawn family fights, child and spouse abuse, divorce
and sometimes homicide.
<p>
An unbalanced work load causes frustration on our crowded
freeways, occasionally resulting in shooting sprees.  Some of
the best hours of our lives are wasted, sitting in traffic jams.
<p>
We still have no coordinated Continent-wide transportation
system (including transport by waterway, rail, air, roadway and
pipeline), and even the magnetic levitated train, invented by
American scientists in the 60s, is being built in both Japan and
Germany while America procrastinates.  Why?  Could it be because
of pressure from powerful oil and motor vehicle companies that
sabotaged electronic trolley busses years ago so they could get
their polluting, energy guzzling vehicles rolling?
<p>
Disregarding the danger to our diminishing resources, we
continue to condone planned obsolescence.  Some of our
scientists are prostituted to discovering new methods of
obsolescence to keep our best of all possible worlds afloat.
Even the simple pencil thrives on planned obsolescence.  How
many times have you sharpened a pencil to a desired point, then
settled down to write only to have a large chunk of lead fall
out at the first touch to you paper?  By the time you resharpen
the pencil, a sizable portion of it disappears.  And light
bulbs...now we can purchase long-lasting ones--for a high price.
The first light bulbs were long lasting.  Easy on resources but
not good for business.  Then we have our sabotaged tires, razor
blades, nylons, electrical equipment...Technocracy calls it
petty larceny on a grand scale.
<p>
Educational systems have become political, financial
institutions that make it difficult for many of our youth to
receive a higher education.  And if they do have that diploma in
hand, what are their prospects for coping in a technological
age?  Most of them don't receive intelligent counseling; they
are given too many unnecessary subjects, conveniently called "a
rounded education" in which they are required to learn a little
in each one.  This naturally detracts from their main goal.
Textbooks are updated more often than is necessary to keep the
money rolling in with no concern for wasted resources, and their
cost is prohibitive.  And speaking of textbooks, was this
"rounded education" curriculum dreamed up in order to sell more
of them?  And the one important subject seldom taught is the
impact of technology on social trends.
<p>
Most of the teachers aren't qualified to teach such a subject.
Many of our college educated citizens, some with families, are
now living on the streets.  Many of our youth feel there is no
future for them, resulting in increased crime, suicides and drug
abuse.
<p>
We can't feed our hungry yet excess food is stored or destroyed
to keep prices up.  We can't provide shelter for our homeless
yet rentals stand idle for lack of tenants with enough money to
pay the high price of a roof overhead.  Technology replaces jobs
but creates a surplus of goods and services that machines
haven't been programmed to buy.  Our largest welfare recipients
are the United States military, politicians, and business and
farm subsidies, yet we crack down on the poor who are jobless or
underpaid through no fault of their own.  Clearly our
distribution system is not effective.  And now we are being
threatened with a breakout of peace on all fronts.  How will we
handle the resultant unemployed?  The list of social problems
goes on and on.
<p>
The technological equipment necessary to enhance our lives
further and insure us a decent standard of living is already
installed.  The technicians needed to operate this equipment are
available.  In fact, they are keeping us alive today in spite of
the interference of politics and money.  Without this
interference we could solve both our environmental and
distribution problems.
<p>
Technocracy's Technological Social Design has been ready for
installation for almost 60 years, but most people won't take the
time to investigate it.  They prefer clinging to the best of all
possible worlds instead of opting for an Eldorado of our times--
the North American Technate.
<p>
Over 200 years have gone by since Voltaire envisioned a
government by science.  Today the technological impact on our
social system is much more severe, and Homo sapiens is the most
corrosive animal of all.  We don't have another 200 years for
political blustering and indecision.  We must soon learn to
govern ourselves intelligently, using our advanced technology
for construction instead of destruction, or our youth may prove
to be correct:  There won't be a future for them.
