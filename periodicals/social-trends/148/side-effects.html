<hr>
Supporters of the &quot;right to bear arms&quot; believe that they
have been granted a guarantee by the Second Amendment to the United
States Constitution to own guns in order to defend themselves from
those who would threaten their security. The tragic side effect of
this kind of self defense is that private gun owners shoot more
innocent people than criminals, whether by accident or intent. In
spite of irrefutable evidence of this phenomenon, gun sales increase,
crime rates multiply, prison cells runneth over, and gun entrepreneurs
smile all the way to the bank, supported by the National Rifle
Association and its cohorts in government.
<p>
A headline in <i>The Portland Oregonian </i>reads: &quot;<b>OREGON
PRISON INDUSTRY BOOMING.&quot;  </b> As of March 29, 1996, the actual
number of prison inmates in Oregon reached 8,182.  Here's a look at
Oregon's prison inmate forecast: 

<ul>
  <li>January 1998:  9,316  
  <li>January 2000: 12,478 
  <li>January 2002: 16,070 
  <li>January 2005: 19,228  
</ul>
<p>
One Oregon citizen was appalled at the reference to prisons as a
growth industry for the state.  In a letter to the editor he wrote:
&quot;...The goal should not be figuring out how to house 10,000 more
inmates. The goal should be how to keep these 10,000 people from going
to jail...&quot;
<p>
Anthony Lewis, <cite>N.Y. Times News Service,</cite>writes:
&quot;Pete Wilson's three
strikes and you're out is making California the world capital of
incarceration.  California used to spend six times as much on higher
education as on prisons.  Now the prison budget is larger.  Prison
guards have a powerful union and now earn more than public school
teachers.  A guard at San Quentin has the same annual salary as an
assistant professor at the University of California:  $45,000.&quot;
<p>
Even if the prison business is booming, it can boom only so far. Who
will pay the taxes to support this extra growth?  Not the prisoners or
the unemployed.
<p>
By now almost everyone realizes that machines eliminate jobs. At last,
the new slaves are taking over and we should rejoice, but our
government in its antiquity makes little allowance in its budget for
massive unemployment.  Many displaced workers will try to survive any
way they can, even if it means breaking the law, and often they wind
up in prison. Instead of structuring the prison system to prepare
these unfortunates for a kinder, gentler life once they get back on
the outside, our prisons turn them into hopeless, classless human
beings who quite often must commit more crime to survive once back in
the unemployment jungle.  Besides, by the time today's newly
incarcerated have served their sentences, jobs will be more obsolete
than before as our unstoppable technology marches on.
<p>
Why, when we aren't threatened by war, do we keep such a gigantic
military establishment. Can you imagine the unemployment that would
result, the thousands  more people roaming around looking for jobs, if
we cut back our military forces and its attendant office personnel,
including those stashed around the world! The companies responsible
for manufacturing military materiel from uniforms to body bags, plus
military hardware, would  shrink from lack of sales, and more
unemployment would ensue; but our dwindling natural resources could
stand a break from mindless exploitation.
<p>
And if we prepared for peace instead of war, what would we do with all
the military hardware we've accumulated?  Dump it in the ocean?
(We've done that before.)  Recycle it?  Sell it?  After all, arms
sales are big business for the Pentagon.  The U.S. has been the
world's top arms dealer for years. Cutting out our unnecessary
military expenditures, from weapons to bloated pensions to housing for
military personnel, would be the biggest case of downsizing in
history.  And the above-listed side effects of military downsizing
skim only the surface.
<p>
In the civilian sector, the CEOs in charge of the companies that are
downsizing are getting fat pay raises.  Compared with all those laid
off, their body count amounts to nothing more than a small splash, but
they have oceans of income.  However, they can spend that income on
only so much produce; after all, there must be a limit to what they
can consume.  So who will buy the rest of it? The part that isn't
destroyed to keep prices up?  Not the downsized workers.
<p>
In the past, tobacco companies had such a powerful lobby, they kept
the political arena in tow. They exerted so much influence on the
people, many started smoking just to be in vogue.  Check out old
movies.  Almost all the stars smoked&#151;at least in the movies.  In
a February, 1947 issue of <i>Cosmopolitan</i>, a cigarette ad reads:
&quot;More doctors smoke Camels than any other brand.&quot;  And,
&quot;Your 'T-Zone' will tell you...T for taste...T for
throat...that's your proving ground for any cigarette.  See if Camels
don't suit your 'T-Zone' to a 'T'&quot;  And the accompanying picture
shows a handsome doctor on foot, bracing himself against a winter
snowstorm, medical bag in hand, making a house call on Christmas Eve.
House call?  On Christmas Eve?  What a sense of humor, although a
recent newspaper article claimed that competition is so stiff now,
some doctors are making house calls again to stay in business.
<p>
We now know the terrible side effects of  long-term smoking, but what
about the side effects of not smoking!  Now that people are cutting
down or cutting it out altogether, how can the government survive
without those cigarette taxes?  And will our politicians have to forgo
PAC money from tobacco conglomerates?  Sad.  And what about those
whose jobs depend on the tobacco industry.  The cigarette magnates
will find a way to survive: push cigarette smoking on third-world
countries; raise the price of cigarettes at home; continue with their
clever ads, such as  &quot;Be Happy, go Lucky.&quot;   (The writer who
thought that slogan up for Lucky Strike cigarettes years ago was paid
several thousands of dollars for four words.)  But will these kings of
all drug pushers go to prison for their folly?  Not likely. The poor
souls caught with a few grams of cocaine will.  	What about the
tobacco farmers!  A recent article in the <i>Associated Press
</i>tells how a &quot;test crop&quot; could protect tobacco farmers'
livelihood.  What kind of a test crop?  &quot;A genetically engineered
variety designed to produce a malaria vaccine and another drug.&quot;
Stay tuned in for the next exciting episode.
<p>
A shortage of jobs is not new.  In the November 12, 1929 issue of the
<i>Portland Telegram</i>, a small item appeared on the front page:
&quot;There are many war veterans in Portland without employment.  An
appeal was made today by C.A. Townsend, president of the Veterans'
Sabre club, for jobs; any kind of work that presents itself.  It is
asked that those who can furnish employment call Broadway 3525.&quot;
<p>
Many World War One veterans came home to find their jobs gone and
machines taking over. In fact it was during this time that a group of
scientists and engineers noticed how quickly the government could
produce machines to do the work in preparation for war. They then
conducted a lengthy survey to determine how this advancing technology
would affect the future job market and other social trends. This
survey eventually developed into the organization known as Technocracy
Inc., whose early predictions of a jobless society are being
vindicated by the march of events.  And still our leaders, over 60
years later, in the face of more machines and a larger population, cry
out for jobs for everyone, welfare recipients and single mothers
included, this at a time when corporations are laying off thousands
and thousands of people permanently, or moving their operations out of
the country.
<p>
Now here is the latest on what politics refers to as a &quot;sacred
cow.&quot;  (You guessed it.  Social Security.)  This program has been
one of the most successful plans to emanate from the United States
Government, if not <i>the</i> most successful.  It has been so
successful that its financial stronghold is the envy of politics whose
members borrow from it frequently, leaving questionable
IOUs. &quot;Pay you later.&quot;  Sure they will.  As William
Raspberry, columnist for the <i>Washington Post Writers Group,
</i>notes:  &quot;The huge baby boom cohorts pay more in Social
Security taxes than current retirees take out; the system is running a
surplus, theoretically. Instead of investing this surplus wisely, it
is used along with general revenues for current government
expenses. The trust fund will one day get an IOU that eventually must
be redeemed by the taxpayers.&quot;
<p>
Senator F. Hollings says, &quot;In plain language, they can't use the
Social Security trust fund to cut the deficit, and yet they keep doing
it.  It's illegal; government knows it; they shrug their shoulders and
call it a  'unified budget', as though that changes something.  The
truth is they're afraid to repeal the law, and they're afraid to obey
it.&quot;
<p>
If  our legislators did succeed in dismantling Social Security, as
they bravely hint at when it isn't election time, where would enough
general revenue to carry on current government expenses come from?
Higher taxes?  As more and more people are being permanently laid off?
And those senior citizens who couldn't make it without their
<u>earned</u> Social Security income&#151;back to the poor farms?  Or
home with the kids?  Those seniors generate a big turnover in the
economic sector with their Social Security checks.
<p>
For almost every political solution to social problems, a serious side
effect cancels its effectiveness. And every political solution becomes
a control of people, which doesn't work as is evidenced by the size of
our prison population.  We need a government that is managed in the
scientific method with a control of things, not people.  With an
intelligent control of things, there would be no need to control
people.   And we need a government that works around the clock and
doesn't spend half its time preparing for the next election.  How can
any government operate efficiently when its members are working full
time for their own benefit: off giving lectures, making wild promises
they know are impossible to keep; slandering their opponents;
participating in tabloid scandals to hurt the opposition; and always
planning ahead, sometimes deviously, to winning the next election.
Where is there time for meaningful accomplishment?
<p>
But that's the way it's been since the beginning of politics, and
until the complete collapse of the money system takes place, politics
will reign supreme.  As President Woodrow Wilson said:  &quot;If you
want to make enemies, try to change something.&quot;
