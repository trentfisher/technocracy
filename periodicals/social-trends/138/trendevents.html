The American  public has been inundated with plans and proposals for a
national health care program.  There seems to be no end to the information, or
misinformation, that is coming from inside the beltway in Washington and the
media concerning this issue.  Whether intentional or not, the American people
are in a state of confusion regarding this matter and have become thoroughly
disgusted with the antics and the performance of the three-ring sideshow that
is going on between the political proponents in the capitol arena.
<p>
After all the years of bickering and debating over a health care
program (since the end of World War II), the government officials and political
representatives in Washington have yet to come to any decision as to what plan
or program would provide the best health and medical care for the nation and
all of the American people.  But when it comes to all of the citizens of the
country having the same health and medical care and treatment received by U.S.
Senators, Representatives, government officials and their families (at
taxpayers expense), then that becomes an entirely different matter.  You can't
expect socialized medicine for everybody.
<p>
While this charade goes on, it provides the politicians with the opportunity
to squeeze millions of dollars from the medical industrial complex, Political
Action Committees (PAC) and other vested interests for the purpose of building
up their campaign slush fund for future political considerations and to use for
their own personal aggrandizement.
<p>
Running true to form and expectations, the financial coffers of the members of
Congress are overflowing from contributions -- bribes would be considered
politically incorrect -- from members of the American Medical Association,
businesses of all kinds, insurance companies and associations, the
pharmaceutical industry, and a myriad of suppliers, including those companies
that produce and sell the sophisticated machines and technology that most
Americans cannot afford when they go to the doctor or hospital.  It is reported
that the lobbying to influence the Congress of the United States on health care
has already reached $100 million, mostly for the purpose of preventing any
meaningful health and medical plan.  How sweet it is for those on the receiving
end.
<p>
One might get the idea that all of this infighting and posturing now going on
in the  hallways of Congress is not over the health of the nation and the
well-being of the American people but over money, profits, and to perpetuate
and maintain the rackets and the status quo of private enterprise.
<p>
Over the years there has been a hue and cry over the ever escalating cost of
the American health care system.  Warnings have gone out that the dollar cost
has gotten out of control, and without significant changes, it would bring the
system down with it.  While already in a chaotic state, the cost of health care
in the United States will soon reach $1 trillion and will continue to take
bigger bites out of the national Gross Domestic Product.  Like a runaway train
with faulty brakes, its momentum has reached the point where it has become
impossible to stop it while operating under an economic system that is geared
to financial considerations and maximizing profits.  Along the way, a disaster
becomes inevitable.
<p>
There is no other business or industry in the United States that can come
close to the size of the mediconglomerates, nor has any other business or
industry grown as fast and become as profitable.  Sensing the smell of success,
the giant corporations and multinationals are becoming major players in this
most lucrative enterprise.  And the medical industrial complex has become the
darling of Wall Street and the investing interests.  The stakes have become so
high that they must be maintained at all costs regardless of the consequences
to the health and the general welfare of the country.
<p>
Of the major industrial nations of the world, the United States (the last of
the superpowers?) is the one country that does not have a comprehensive health
and medical care program.  Is this not an indictment of the political process
and this superfinancial system?  But it should be understood that just passing
a comprehensive-universal health bill in itself would be far from adequate in
meeting the underlying problems that confront the country, not when all the
elements and conditions that cause and breed diseases and illnesses that
permeate society are still left intact.  Rather than dealing with mere symtoms,
the health of the nation must be dealt with in totality.
<p>
Why is it that after a half century the government of the United States finds
it so difficult to come to a decision on providing  a comprehensive and
effective health program for all of its citizens?  The Congress and the
Administration in Washington had no trouble when it came to spending over $10
trillion on defense and preparations for war during the Cold War, coming up
with billions of dollars to send a man to the moon, appropriating billions of
dollars to bail out the Savings and Loan industry, continuing to subsidize
businesses and making loans, forgiving the debts of foreign countries, creating
trillions of dollars and becoming the largest debtor nation in the world just
to keep the present economic system going, and  they continue to play the
profligate in the disbursement of funds for pork barrel projects and other
favorites (ad infinitum).
<p>
Where are the country's priorities?  Is the perpetuation of a financial and
monetary system and maintaining a market oriented economy and capitalism more
important than the health of the nation and the well-being of the American
people?  The answer to that question must be obvious.  It is impossible to have
a healthy and strong America under an economic system that puts a price tag on
everything that is necessary for survival.
<p>
If America wants to minimize and prevent the further decay and deterioration
of the health and welfare of the country, she must consider a fundamental
change now from the present economic system to a method of social and
industrial operation that puts the essential requirements and the well-being of
the nation above mere pecuniary gain and financial considerations.  Anything
less would be a mockery and a continuation of the same old exercise in
duplicity.
