<p>
The renaissance of science took place at the beginning of a European age of
trade.  It was born among a materialistic people whose business entrepreneurs
perceived that science could be used by them for power and profit, and with its
application they reinforced their exclusive claim to the Earth and the
Universe, reflecting the tyrannical absolutism of antiquity.  "Might is right.
Justice is in the interest of the Strong" is borne upon the heraldic arms of
all exploiters whether King, commissar, president, theocrat or
business/financial entrepreneur, who, since time immemorial, has with
consummate deception and propaganda created a coven of witches, heretics,
communists, or dissidents to divert the attention of their sycophants and
moronic followers from their sophisticated, calculated control and
corruptions.
<p>
Prior to science there was no dependable relationship between cause and
effect; all "knowledge" and all theory were colored by man's prejudices,
superstitions, and by his religions and their arrogant power and
interpretations.  <i>All the provable knowledge we have by the exercise of
reason </i>has been given to us by science.
<p>
In the advancement of mechanics and engineering, in medicine, and in all the
other fields of research, the honesty of scientific investigation toward
objectives requires the abdication of bias and prejudice.  With this
commitment, in a few centuries man has traveled by accomplishment from
horseback to the supersonic plane and space vehicles, from
ignorance of the circulatory system to electronic microscopy and now to genetic
engineering.  Our boots are not merely seven league:  they traverse the
universe.  Our vision encompasses light years.  Our hearing, made
ultra-sensitive, seeks the voices of the unknown.  Meanwhile we lack
understanding.
<p>
Man's physical senses and productive abilities have been extended enormously,
and the degree and speed of that achievement are the most common source of our
contemporary vanity.  Science has contracted time and space through electronic
communication and space technology and, once again, as in the days of
Inquisition, offers a new mental challenge to the uniqueness that is human
life!  We have confirmed legends, the finale of fairy tales.  All the physical
imagining of man when he was limited to the powers of his own body is being
realized.  But not yet has any good whatever come of it -- only the greatest
evil man has yet endured.
<p>
The advancement of science hardly taxed the human species compared with the
human labor expended in the erection of tombs, pyramids, walled cities, altars,
cathedrals, monuments and other structures in the name of gods, generals and
exploiters.  And now the human troglodyte, in an attempt to escape from his own
aberrations, constructs and seeks his shelter in a hole in the ground.  So is
the descending spiral of man's imagination and self evaluation.
<p>
Material wealth supplanted wisdom as the entrepreneurs and their political
collaborators subsidized and proselytized scientists to conform to the lowest
common denominator -- greed, and to unquestioning political loyalty enforced by
"hit lists" that are the instrument of all closed societies, thereby
compromising their integrity; and this represents the dilemma of the scientist
who exemplifies knowledge with a dedication to Reason, and of a society
purportedly dedicated to liberty and freedom.
<p>
As a social critic 40 years ago stated, "The electron tube, the locomotive,
the internal combustion engine, the suspension bridge, vaccine and the glass
giant of Palomar were turned over to the cruel bumpkin of the Middle Ages and
his pal, the naked bushman leaping around his tribal fire."  (Witness today our
political leaders, their generals, and the purchasers of their loyalties and
services.)
<p>
No other attributes of man were, in any way, either extended or vitalized by
science to justify the claim that we are civilized.
<p>
A few suits of clothes, some money in the bank, and a new kind of fear
constitute the main differences between the average American today and the
hairy men with clubs who accompanied Attila to the city of Rome.  (During this
century) the behavior of Attila's boys was duplicated by millions upon millions
of Nazi soldiers and laymen, in detail.  They were Western men, scientific and
Christian, like ourselves.  Each acted from an environment as modern as ours.
Each had studied science and each had gone to church -- each of millions -- and
yet each was able to embrace rape, murder and torture, larceny, mayhem and
every other barbarous infamy the minute opportunity spelled itself in letters
acceptable to him.
<p>
Rotterdam, Coventry, Nanking, Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Stalingrad and Vietnam are
monuments of man's barbarism, his failure to seek enlightenment, -- stumbling
in the penumbra of political sophistries and evasive equivocations.
<p>
With the exception of Technocracy, there is no Reason visible today in a whole
world implemented by reason.  A world that at last has unlocked the secret of
objects whose strength is as the strength of suns (accomplished only because of
the pure part of a few minds) has become a world of muscle, carnivorous, with
very little brain.  A new beast of prey -- Man, destroying, huge -- who dimly
blinks at the shape of extinction, sees the coming of hunger on a planet his
own strength has scourged.  A stupid character who has sought violence as the
means of his arrogant perfection, and hypocritically to protect himself; who
now sits in the gloom of a nonradiant mind, waiting for radiation to consume
his tissues.  The one animal who ever feared himself -- as well he
might.
<p>
The science-built world of engines and laboratories in which man lives has
grown up apart from man himself.  Science has not instructed man -- it has only
implemented him.  Science, which has enjoyed its few centuries of light and
truth, is locked up and made military.  Liberty has been struck dead at its
source, and the bony old man, the black-cloaked figure of death, has come to
squat in every dooryard of the world.
<p>
Anthropus erectus, who can possess the living spark of the cosmos, the
creative spirit, having discovered the scientific laws that govern the
universe, wallows through rivers of blood and hatred and the rubble of disorder
and discord.  Cosmic is the vision of the world but also tragic.  The world,
which has struggled through chaos for aeons, lacks the human spirit and will to
create a humane society, the construction of a social order in harmony with
Nature and noble purposes.  To transvaluate all values, the disorder of
unbridled competition, of cut-throat egotism and mass murder meets with
doctrinal resistance.
<p>
Out of the cosmic power have come the organisms and cells that are life and
man.  It has assembled electrons and atoms and molecules that manifest a
magnificence and infuse an order and law and sense of harmony into the universe
that has a definite and glorious and marvelous intention with the human race.
It is a power that has the intention of bringing about a more perfect unity
that <u>we can</u>, <u>and must establish</u>!  This hour! Through our
thoughts, design and action.
<p>
The laws of nature, of the universe, encompass all humanity, one flesh, one
blood.  All that these laws ask is that humanity shall also live as one, though
of singular diversity; to live in harmony with Nature in a unity of purpose and
to practice justice.  These laws are devoid of parochialism, theological or
philosophical ponderings, and all irrelevant economic and political
shibboleths.  This creative force asks that now a new era begin.
<p>
In our aberrant society, everything in the intellectual, economic, political
and moral realms is made subject to the criterion of success.  As a result,
science sees its focus changed from research or explanation to utility and
adaption, and there is no longer room for the integrity of thought; the
critical method has now become retrogressive.  Adaption to the demands of a
system that evaluates its success in terms of price, of fiscal profit,
relegates humanity to the repressive ages preceding the Renaissance.
<p>
Justice no longer has the triumph of right as its exclusive objective, but
rather the prompt execution of the commands of the State, whose elitist goals
are a public swindle and an assassination of sanity.
<p>
And so man stands impoverished in mind, in body, in spirit; paralyzed,
impotent, trembling as the meaning of existence remains as distant as the
nearest star.  Man, displaced from the Center of the Universe by science, in
his programmed ignorance has become an unwitting collaborator in the
denigration of Life, an acquiescent vassal in a feudal price system ruled by
entrenched doctrinaires, egotists and elitists who have staked their exclusive
claim to the Earth and the Universe.  Never have so many over the millenniums
given unquestioning recreant fealty to so few, to their lords and masters of
the exchequer who in their arrogance proclaim themselves a chosen
people.
<p>
Today in our Nation there now exists the narrow, intolerant spirit of Sparta,
the concept of the individual sacrificed to the State, a State religion
expounding a sham glory, spinning the old tangled web of intrigue, sorrow and
suffering, heralding the tragedy of a thousand-thousand Hecubas.  As a Nation
we have not gained insight from the history of the Peloponnesian War to the
present.  The New Order of the Ages was not meant for a Greek tragedy -- a
contrived Warfare State, the last expedient of psychopaths where brutalizing
fear holds sway.  Once more we must put to use those same critical powers that
have removed man from the Center of the Universe; we must dare to think, to
see, to understand, to question and to challenge everything.  The power is
within us to give America creative significance never before achieved and bring
about a renaissance, the splendor of man's unalienable rights.  It is time for
a Declaration of Mental Emancipation.
<p>
The tragedies of humanity arise out of a lack of understanding of the
evolution of culture and the development and purpose of social organization.
Man is unique: he is the only living species that has culture.
<p>
Man has developed his own culture of tools, implements, ornaments, customs,
institutions, beliefs, rituals, works of art, language, etc.  It is divided
into four categories:  ideological, sociological, technological, and
attitudinal.
<p>
The ideological sector is composed of beliefs depending upon symbolism or
articulate speech for their origin and perpetuation.  Under this category man
created his gods and demons, heavens and hells, and their immortality; and by
means of magic and ritual he sought to capture the illusion of power and
control over things and events;  in the process he seemed capable of accepting
resurrection from the grave and levitation but incapable or unwilling to
nurture life, liberty and freedom.
<p>
The sociological components are the customs, institutions, rules and patterns
of interpersonal behavior.  When these components are analyzed clearly, they
indicate that the ruling elements of all societies today, as in the past, have
special power and privilege primarily because they control the major means of
coercion that enforce physical, economic and mental enslavement, and if
unchallenged in their rule and purpose, they can end the long arduous
evolutionary development of humankind in its search for individual and
collective freedom and security.
<p>
Entered into culture is the technological sector.  The use of tools was a
cumulative, progressive process that, as an example, distinguishes the Age of
Coal and Steel from the Middle Ages.  In the human tool process, one generation
may begin where the preceding generation left off.
<p>
The purpose and function of culture when applied creatively and with equity
are to make life secure and enduring for the human species.  Specifically to
relate man to his environment -- his terrestrial habitat and encompassing
cosmos, and to relate man to man.  The life process is carried on collectively
as well as individually.
<p>
For the effective conduct of life and for the survival of the human species,
in the technological adjustment to and control over the natural habitat, social
organization is imperative. The life-sustaining, life-perpetuating processes
are technological in a broad but valid sense; that is,  they are carried on by
material, mechanical, biophysical and biochemical means that require functional
coordination.
<p>
Knowledge and understanding in technological terms improve, increase and
extend the life-sustaining and enhancing processes.  Witness the great effect
wrought upon knowledge, belief and outlook -- upon philosophy -- by the
telescope and microscope, by the advances in agriculture, by technological
explorations in the physical, chemical, biological, geological, and
meteorological and astronomical realms.
<p>
<b><i>Social systems were and are forced to change by technological impact or
retrogress and disintegrate.</i></b>
<p>
As the technological structuring of experience changes, the philosophic
expressions of experience face either evolutionary change and adjustment or
chaos.  For example, a set of beliefs, or certain attitudes, may oppose medical
technology as applicable to the life-sustaining capabilities of the terrestrial
environment, but it is the finite biotic potential of the environment that will
be the final determinant of man's existence.  When non-technological cultural
elements, be they social, ideational, or emotional, oppose or misapply
technological progress, such as the programmed scarcity in agriculture, the
contrived waste, obsolescence and restrictions in the industrial process, the
voracious destruction of natural resources and the poisoning of the environment
for profit, the economic discard of humanity, or the enforcement of the status
quo through political obstruction and corruption and the psycopathy of war,
then man's culture will develop stresses that in the past have resulted in the
disintegration of dynasties and empires.
<p>
<a name="part2"> </a>
<p>
To define and understand a social system, one must progress beyond the labels
of democracy, fascism, communism and socialism and treat human societies in the
same attitude with which a physicist regards nebulae, stars or atoms.  In each
instance material systems are involved, systems that may be studied and
interpreted from the standpoint of structure and function.  This was the
procedure involved in Technocracy's Analysis and Design.
<p>
The "why" of a society or social system in a state of civilization can  be
justified only in terms of sustaining, perpetuating and enhancing life by
concerted cooperative action.
<p>
Proceeding to particulars:  The drama of terrestrial evolution, of galaxies,
of all living organisms and of the society of man, and in particular our
technological culture, can best be described in terms of matter and energy, or
more precisely in terms of energy.  "The Laws expressing the relations between
energy and matter are not solely of importance in pure science; they
necessarily come first in order in the whole record of human experience, and
they control in the last resort the rise and fall of political systems, the
freedom or bondage of nations, the movement of commerce and industry, the
origin of wealth and poverty, and the general physical welfare of the race."
(Soddy, F.)  Energy is the dynamic, living force that animates cultural systems
and develops them to higher levels and forms.
<p>
We can compare cultures in terms of the amount of energy harnessed and
expended per capita per year.  An average adult man is capable of generating
about one-tenth of one horsepower of energy.  Culture could not, and for ages
on end did not, develop beyond the limit thus set by the one-tenth horsepower,
and mankind would have remained in a primitive condition indefinitely had not
an increase of his available energy resources been made possible.
<p>
Prior to the first great cultural revolution, the Agricultural Revolution and
the rise of civil society, the economic systems of primitive society placed
human relations -- human rights and human welfare -- above property relations
and rights; they were human, or humane, ethical, and personal systems.  Based
upon kinship everyone had free access to the resources of Nature.  This made
for equality and freedom since equality precludes the possibility of the rule
or exploitation of one class by another.  It was not 
ownership but the right to <u>use</u> that was significant.  The economic
organization of primitive society was virtually identical with its kinship
organization but went beyond the nuclear and extended family to include widows,
widowers and orphans.  With the evolution of the family and kinship unit and
the acquired ability and means to behave cooperatively in life-sustaining and
life-preserving activities, the door was opened to virtually unlimited social
evolution because of the almost limitless possibilities of the development, the
expansion and extension, of cooperation.  The basic rights of primitive society
stand out in bold relief because the political character of a society, whether
it is democratic, feudalistic, or communistic, is determined by the way in
which man's relations to the resources of Nature are organized.
<p>
As Leslie White, anthropologist, delineated in his book, <i>The Evolution of
Culture</i>, with the advent of the Agricultural Revolution "the breakup of
tribal society based upon kinship was attended with confusion and violence."
With the improvement in the art of agricultural technology and the development
of field culture "there was a competition and struggle for natural resources --
fertile lands especially -- and for accumulation of wealth produced."  Out of
this confusion, competition and struggle, political/military rulers and
priesthoods arose to power, the one through physical force, the other by means
of supernaturalist influence and control.  Sheer possession of the land became
the basis of power.  This power was extended to the production of wealth and to
control over wealth produced.  The result was class division and class rule:  a
ruling class with a monopoly of control over natural resources and the means of
production and a monopoly of military and political power; and a subordinate
class whose lot was one of production, privation, and political
impotence.
<p>
The transformation of social organization from tribal society to civil society
in the Fertile Crescent of the valleys of the Nile, the Tigris and Euphrates
Rivers was made possible through the mechanisms of integration and control
represented by the creation of the power structures of the state-church
exemplified by Egypt and the mercantile oligarchies such as Sumeria and
Babylonia. The economic systems of both engaged in the subordination of human
rights and human welfare to property rights achieved by class status.  In
Mesopotamia religious temples also served as banks and the "contract" as a
legal device for business transactions was invented by Sumerian temple
officials.  Land tenure unquestionably became the most important factor in the
economic systems of the Bronze and Iron Age cultures and remained so with few
exceptions until the Industrial and Fuel Revolution got underway in Western
Europe after the discovery of America.
<p>
The disintegration of kinship societies and the structural erection of a civil
society based upon class distinction and stratification, furthered under the
auspices, assumed authority and power of the organized priestcraft of the
church-state and the commercial oligarchies, required special mechanisms to
implement, enforce and perpetuate the power of the dominant class.  Structure
and function are closely related, and a social system based upon subordinate
classes whose survival was subject to the power, capabilities and
discriminatory practices of the dominant authority required the institution of
social control to suppress any objections or rebellion.
<p>
The enforcement controls over individual and collective aspirations for
liberty, freedom and equality were varied.  Originally this position was
maintained by the employment of military force but was not always successful as
numerous uprisings of serfs and slaves made clear.  And so the powers and
controls of the priestcraft and State were co-joined and elaborated upon,
encompassing the mechanism of tribunals of self proclaimed infallibility
issuing laws, commandments, interdictions and the loyalty oaths of antiquity.
Thus came into being the ultimate control over humanity, the control and
intimidation of the human mind that over the succeeding centuries and thousands
of years to this day, and in this nation, were to witness judgment upon
dissidents, freethinkers, including scientists, artists and educators as
threats to the power structure with subsequent ostracizing, imprisonment and
the issuance of death penalties.
<p>
The intent of control over the human mind was well expressed in the conception
of education as a political process by Aristotle in his text, <i>Politics:
</i>"Of all things that I have mentioned, that which contributes most to the
permanence of constitutions is the adaptation of education to form of
government...That education would be regulated by law and should be an affair
of the state is not to be denied.  The citizen should be molded to suit the
form of government under which he lives."
<p>
Over two thousand years later Napoleon Bonaparte expressed much the same view:
"Of all political questions, that (of education) is perhaps the most important.
There cannot be a firmly established political state unless there is a teaching
body with definitely recognized principles."
<p>
All the aforesaid is a brief outline of the origin of the Price System, of
social control, of ownership, land tenure and monopolies created upon the
exploitation of the human energy of serfs, slaves and peasants, an ownership of
the man-hours of human energy that remains an integral part of our cultural
system today.  Imported into the New World, it became the foundation upon which
our nation was created.  It incorporated slavery, racial and sex
discriminations, the serfdom of child labor and the denial of suffrage to
approximately 75 percent of American citizens because of lack of property
qualification.  Ten United States presidents as the owners of slaves gave
credence and/or support to this cultural system of class stratification and
exploitation.
<p>
All the suffering, indignities and degradation that come from slavery,
serfdom, prostitution, usury, dependence upon wages, unemployment, wars of
conquest and expropriation, colonial rule and exploitation are inherent in the
economic systems of civil society.
<p>
In commercial systems, anything may be bought or sold:  political office, a
judge's honor, a citizen's allegiance.  There is no crime however heinous that
men will not commit in obedience to their economic systems.  What is one to say
of social systems that condemn millions to lifelong poverty and want in the
midst of plenty;  and when one considers modern systems of mass destruction of
human life, it would be rather difficult to make a convincing case for a higher
evaluation of life in modern nations as compared with primitive
tribes.
<p>
In the 20th century of civil society, the military/industrial complex of our
Nation invaded the higher academic facilities in the development of the
ultimate weapon of the ideological enforcement of inequality and class
stratification, and that is complementary to the vindictive ecclesiastic
philosophy of "fall and redemption."  It was an advent referred to in the
farewell address of President Eisenhower as also heralding "the prospect of
domination of the nation's scholars" in our free universities.  Further
penetration of the nation's universities that threatens the free exchange of
ideas and the freedom of research is in the seeking of control over genetic
engineering by the commercial oligarchy with the potential on "The Human
Agenda" of the creation of an inhuman race of "cyborgs", or as has been
proposed in England that Parliament enact an "aristogenics" bill that would
grant to the aristocracy of blood and mind certain eugenical privileges.  In
addition theologians of various persuasions, with political support, continue
their interdiction of science and public education as a threat to their
oracular realm of belief, superstitions, and grotesque gargoyles.
<p>
To be human is a learned process effected by response to the cultural
environment and whether humans are used as tools of society or become prime
movers in the sociocultural order.  It is not an unexpected irony that our
temples of knowledge are not erected upon Olympian heights dedicated to wisdom,
human cooperation and human dignity, but have become adjuncts to the Augean
stables of exploitation and competition, and in the process have become the
walls of redoubt that protect the status quo of the recorded six thousand years
of Princely privilege.  The human mind is relatively an uncultured energy
source, a mental cosmos, capable of entertaining abstract ideas of great
creative import.  With abstract ideas being used for destructive ideological
purposes, unchallenged by those engaged in apostate scientific endeavors, one
must ask the question, "knowledge for what?"  if not for a rational society,
especially when freedom is under attack in our own culture.  As in Technocracy
there must be vital social analysis combined with needed social action.  With
special power and privilege in control of the major means of coercion, there
can be no assumption of the hypocritical priestly posture of neutrality.  It is
time to question who benefits from existing social arrangements.  We must ask
what functions our cultural system serves, for whom is it functional?  Under no
circumstances must the forces of society, as power politics and the
military/industrial complex do today, compel individuals to deform or falsify
themselves.  When you are confronted with a manure shovel, do not sanitize it
as the politics of war and exploitation do today.  If science and society are
to become humanistic, facts must be depicted accurately and decisions made and
acted thereupon accordingly.
<p>
Is life to be one Vast Imbecility, framed and played as some vast vulgar jest,
each of us a practicing deicide, a killer of wisdom and the betrayer of the
Future?
<p>
In one man's viewpoint, the Earth that was meant to be a garden of Eden to
nourish the mind (not just to surfeit the body) through ignorance, greed,
indifference and ruthless exploitation has become our cultural manure pile
whose fluorescent sheen and odor are the decaying dreams and aspirations of the
young, the anguish, fears and insecurity of the elders, the poverty and
functional illiteracy of tens of millions, the frustration and stagnation of
the unwanted unemployed, the poisoned waters and air, and the wasteland of
hundreds of millions of acres of eroded and exploited life.  Its engulfing
enormity needs interring to enable the sanity of mind to grow and blossom and
perfume our lives.
<p>
From the Elysian fields of education, science, engineering and technology came
the inspiration that created our Nation.  It was a moment in history that held
the high hope that an age of knowledge, enlightenment and equality would
prevail only to end with the proponents of reason and equality virulently
attacked and betrayed.  At the outset a society of pseudo aristoi of power and
wealth used knowledge as an instrument of power and wealth and continues to do
so to this day.  What knowledge does to a man in clarifying what he is and
setting him free -- that is the personal ideal of knowledge.  What knowledge
does to a civilization in revealing its human meaning and setting it free --
that is the social ideal of knowledge.  John Adams wrote, "...Science, arts,
taste, sense and letters, are employed for the purpose of injustice as well as
for virtue."  That was in 1790; today we have good reason to know that it is so
as the schemed betrayal of the ideal of knowledge halos power with
authority.
<p>
In the 20th century the power of governance of our highly complex, technical
society through elective or appointive office has been given to those whose
previous incompetence were in the unrelated activities of second rate movies,
haberdashery and other mediocrities, and whose political blatherings are
written by medicine-show pitchmen for the functionally illiterate.  It is a
method of operation found very effective by the PAC shills and very lucrative
by the pickpocket exploiters.
<p>
Today when human survival is at stake, it is imperative that we Americans be
informed that a new kind of knowledge is needed to unravel the nature of the
cohesive forces that maintain man in an integrated state physically,
psychologically and socially, and that would enable him to relate creatively to
his surroundings.  Science must be assigned this task of serving human
knowledge in bringing understanding, freedom and happiness rather than power,
regimentation and technological development based upon the destructive and
selfish tenets of exponential growth and special privilege.  Emphasis on such a
humanistic criteria points to the need for an enlargement and rededication of
scientific enterprise.  This endeavor will see the successful weaving of the
intellectual and practical applications of science into the fabric of modern
life.
<p>
Technocracy finds that the day when social operations on this Continent can be
based on a system of "values" has passed, and that it is now necessary that
there be applied in the social field the quantitative methods of physical
science.
