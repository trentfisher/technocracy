<p>
The landed estate of the American people is the resource base
upon which American economy functions, and our survival and
future welfare depend upon the thought we give to its best use
and how we can achieve it. A system based upon ruthless
exploitation and exponential growth on a finite Earth cannot
continue without our destruction.
<p>
America is a civilization of extraneous energy and metals. Who-
so-ever controls the energy and mineral resources critical to
the functions that govern our lives, controls and dictates our
individual destiny and the continued evolution of our
technological culture. Environmental breakdown and the
exhaustion of the Earth's finite resources, fostered by
ignorance, arrogance and greed, form the threats to the peace
and security of our nation that Howard Scott in 1963 identified
as <strong>The Continuing Crisis</strong>, which is the subject
of this report.
<p>
Man's impulse to dominate as well as to destroy is proving
continuously disastrous, not only in the political and social
sense, but in the physical sense. For man's destructiveness has
turned not only upon himself but upon his own good earth--the
wellspring of his life.
<p>
In 1939, Dr. Hugh H. Bennett, Soils Conservation Service, USDA,
in testimony to a Congressional committee stated: "In the short
life of this country we have essentially destroyed 282 million
acres
<p>
of land, crop and range land. Erosion is destructively active on
775 million additional acres. Almost 100 million
<p>
acres of cropland, much of it representing the best cropland we
have, is finished in this country. We cannot restore it."
<p>
In the late 1970's, American farmers were losing nearly as much
topsoil as they had lost during the Dust Bowl yearsof the 1930s.
<p>
"Every grain of wheat and rye, every sugar beet, every egg and
piece of veal, every spoonful of olive oil and glass of wine
depends on an irreducible minimum of earth to produce it. The
earth is not elastic, it cannot be stretched;the human race,
every nation, is limited in the number of acres it possesses.
And as the number of human beings increases, the relative amount
of productive earth decreases by that amount." (World Watch, 2-
1-93)
<p>
Thirty years have passed since Howard Scott gave his technical
analysis of the factors and components that comprise <strong>The
Continuing Crisis</strong>: land, soil, water, mineral
resources, energy and population growth. It was his broad
spectrum of knowledge, high intelligence, strategical genius and
integrity that developed an idea for human survival that is in
harmony with the facts and social needs of humanity. It
constitutes the plan of social operations for the North American
Continent known as Technocracy. His brilliance and prescience
serve humanity today as a Polar star.
<p>
If we are to survive and continue to progress intellectually, it
is imperative that any projection of the research data, and
additions or modifications thereto, or omissions, be carefully
verified by critical minds. The inclusion of the latter type of
data when applied to a particular category often requires
further defining for exactitude, necessitated by the import
ofother limiting factors. To illustrate--the critical import and
impact of unconsidered factors are revealed in U.S. Department
of Agriculture data, and provisos incorporated by Congress in
the Food Security Act of 1985, which scheduled a shift of 45
million acres of highly erodable, unsustainable acres of
cropland to grassland and woodland. If 40 million of the 45
million acres to be retired was in grain, it was estimated the
unsustainable output would amount to 48 million metric tons.
<p>
In addition to mining soil, which has continued from the
founding of our nation, some farmers are also mining underground
water supplies. The fossil aquifer depletion of the Ogallala,
which supplies irrigation water in the Great Plains from
Nebraska to Texas panhandle, is an example. It is reported that
the effect of its falling water level on irrigation has been
traumatic. In the six states that rely most heavily on the
Ogallala--Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oklahoma and
Texas--, irrigated area declined 15 percent between 1978 and
1984.
<p>
A U.S. Department of Agriculture study reported that the water
table is falling at least 6 inches, and in some cases up to
several feet per year on over 14 million of the 30 million acres
irrigated with groundwater. When the land eventually reverts to
dry-land farming or range land, grain production will be reduced
by an estimated 9 million tons. Combining this figure with the
grain output on highly erodable land, yields of a total of 57
million metric tons of grain output per year are listed as
unsustainable.
<p>
In 1985, in an analysis of Third World nutrition, it was
estimated that the impact of population growth between 1970 and
1980 had increased the number of malnourished people from some
680 million to 730million.
<p>
The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Economic Research
Service (ERS), and World Indices, in 1986 warned that if , as
projected, another billion people are added to world population
over the remaining years of this century, the world grain
harvested area, which dropped from 0.24 hectares per capita in
1950 to 0.15 hectares in 1986, will shrink to 0.12 hectares per
person.
<p>
Population projections for those Third World countries where
life support-systems are already disintegrating can only be
described as projections of disaster.
<p>
In 1984 the United States accounted for 44% of the world's
cereal exports. Consider previously mentioned data regarding the
destructive mining of the soil, the unsustainable millions of
acres of cropland, and the continuous exhaustive depletion of
the Ogallala aquifer.
<p>
In 1985 there were 2,275,000 farms in the United states with a
population of 5,355,000, comprising 2.2% of the U.S. total
population. 256 million acres of cropland were harvested for
domestic use, 1.07 acres per capita.
<p>
A major shift in American population away from the farm has
taken place within the last 20 years. In 1910, 32 million lived
on farms; today (1992) 4.5 million do, and many of those still
living there have jobs other than growing crops. Why? A
demographer at the Department of Agriculture points to
mechanization, chemicals and better seeds. It has been
succinctly stated that, "When the Constitution was signed, 90
percent of the U.S. population lived on farms...Only 2 percent
of Americans rise with the rooster now."
<p>
In 1985, U.S. farm technology included the following:
<ul>
  <li>4,676,000 tractors (311 million horse power)
  <li>645,000 combines
  <li>684,000 corn pickers
  <li>800,000 pickup bailers
  <li>285,000 field forage harvesters
  <li>3,380,000 motor trucks
</ul>
<p>
The amount of energy used in U.S. agriculture for producing food
on farms in 1979 was estimated to be about 2.1 quads/year. The
conversion factor of quad as a unit of energy measurement of
petroleum equals 181 million barrels. Of the 2.1 quad, about
half, or 190 million barrels, is actually consumed as fuel on
the farm, and about half is used in producing fertilizer,
pesticides, and other farm chemicals.
<p>
Livestock inventory and production --milk cows, poultry, etc.,
and their environmentally controlled habitat requirements are in
separate categories.
<p>
By 1986, in North America, which produces nearly one-fourth of
the world's grain, four-fifths of all the oil discovered to date
had already been consumed.
<p>
Agriculture as an energy conversion system in a technological
culture is highly vulnerable to the availability of fossil fuel
energy.
<p>
<h3>Critical Data</h3>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>U.S. oil production peaked in 1970 at 3.5 billion barrels.
  <li>Domestic natural gas production peaked in 1973 at 21.7 trillion
      cubic feet.
  <li> U.S. oil production in 1992 was 2.5 billion barrels (at a
      production level of 7.1 million barrels per  day).
  <li> U.S. oil import in 1992 was 6.2 billion barrels. (17
      million barrels daily).
  <li> U.S. military used 198 million barrels in fiscal year 1990.
  <li> Proven U.S. oil reserves in the United States to-  talled
      36 billion barrels in 1985, enough to sup-  ply U.S. needs for
      less than 8 years at the then current rates of use.
</ul>
<p>
<h3>U.S. Oil Consumption Index</h3>
<ul>
  <li>64% for transportation, 2/3 of which is for motor gasoline
      (about 300 million gallons per day)
  <li> 25% for industrial purposes
  <li> 8% for residential and commercial (primarily heating)
  <li> 3% for electric power generation
</ul>
<p>
A report entitled "Armed Force and Imported Resources" by the
<em>Center for Defense Information, 1992,</em> merits attention,
in particular the research data on petroleum and accompanying
evaluation. Quote: "The United States is by far the world's
largest consumer of petroleum. Compared to other industrialized
countries, we use 20% more petroleum to produce a given quantity
of goods and services, and our per capita is almost double. Our
per capita use of all forms of energy is more than six times the
world average.
<p>
"Adding the cost of oil itself to the cost of military forces
maintained to assure access to oil supplies brings the total
cost for Americans to at least $90 per barrel. Even this
startling figure ignores the dollar cost of Desert Shield/Storm,
most of which has been covered by payments from the U.S.
allies."
<p>
The report quotes U.S. Geological Survey experts as predicting
that the world's supply of oil suitable for fuel "will be mostly
exhausted by the middle of the 21st Century." As developing
nations grow in industrial activity, increasing demands upon
this shrinking supply are expected to "aggravate 'North-South'
tensions that are already apparent in standards of living."
<p>
America's social traitors, whose strategy of power, plunder and
profit in the exploitation of our oil and mineral resources has
made our country a "have-not" nation, are now transnationals
whose aggressive policies are supported by the military and
underwritten with the lives of American youth.
<p>
There are little known factors of great social significance,
whose exposure offers a new evaluation of our ever expanding
political, economic and military ventures over the past 72 years
on the continent of Africa, that are surfacing anew in the
tragedy that is Somalia. Ventures whose corruptions are only
surpassed by betrayal and the planned plunder of the resources
of the peoples of continental Russia, who were our allies in two
World Wars.
<p>
President Kennedy in June 1963, in attesting to their valor and
commitment as an ally stated, "No nation in the history of
battle ever suffered more than the Soviet Union suffered in the
causeof the Second World War. At least 20 million lost their
lives. Countless millions of homes and farms were burned or
sacked. Hospitals, schools, theaters and museums wrecked. A
third of the nation's territory, including nearly two thirds of
its industrial base, was turned into a wasteland--a loss
equivalent to the devastation of this country east of Chicago."
<p>
So with the dismemberment of the Soviet Union, and in the
shambles they helped dictate and create, America's corporate
structures, like vultures, have come to roost.

<a name="part2"> </a>
<p>
As reported after World War I, there was a struggle for power in
the Middle East where the British and the French were in the
process of dismembering the old Ottoman Empire as spoils of the
war. In 1921 Herbert Hoover, then U.S. Secretary of Commerce,
persuaded seven U.S. oil companies to act under the American
flag as a consortium in a joint venture known as Iraq Petroleum
Co., (formerly Turkish Petroleum Co.), with British Petroleum,
Royal Dutch Shell, and the French National Oil Company as
founding conspirators.
<p>
In the consortium were Jersey Standard (EXXON), New York
Standard (MOBIL), Texas Oil (ARCO), that later absorbed
Sinclair, Mexican Oil and Gulf. Under the direction of the U.S.
Department of State they were organized as the Near East
Development Corporation. Of the group only two, Jersey Standard
and New York Standard, continued as participants in the
formation of the first international petroleum cartel. They were
to share a 23.7% interest in Iraq Petroleum Co. Negotiations to
form IPC went on for three years, between 1925 and 1928. In 1928
Jersey Standard and New York Standard joined with Anglo-Iranian
Oil (later to become British Petroleum), Shell, the French
National Oil Company, and Gulbenkian, the legendary Armenian
entrepreneur and promoter of Iraq Petroleum, in its various
exploitations.
<p>
IPC was set up not merely to exploit the oil resources of Iraq
but any oil that might be found in a huge area extending from
Turkey down to the tip of Saudi Arabia. British Petroleum, Royal
Dutch Shell and the French National Oil Company each also
received a 23.7% stake in the company. The area mapped to be
exploited was incorporated within the Red Line Agreement and
encompassed Turkey, Syria, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and what is now
Jordan. All exploration and production was to be conducted by
IPC acting exclusively as a group. The Red Line Agreement
continued in effect until 1948.      Iran was outside the Red
Line, but British Petroleum already held a concession there.
Also, just outside the Red Line was the little sheikdom of
Kuwait.
<p>
Gulf Oil, which had separated itself from the cartel, sought to
gain access to Kuwaiti oil, but its entry was blocked through
opposition by British Petroleum.
<p>
In March 1932 President Herbert Hoover appointed his former
Treasury secretary, Andrew Mellon, one-time president of Gulf
Oil, as the U.S. Ambassador to Britain. From his strategic
position in London, Mellon argued vociferously thecase for Gulf,
in which his family happened to own a 25% interest.
<p>
The Gulf-BP conflict ended in a typical international oil
settlement. On December 23, 1934, Gulf and BP signed an
agreement with Kuwait for joint exploration. Oil was first found
in Kuwait in 1938, but World War II postponed development. The
first shipment of oil did not leave Kuwait until 1946.
<p>
Gulf loaded the Kuwaiti oil on their tankers and sold it around
the world. They became Japan's number one oil supplier. Gulf's
privileged concession was reduced when the Kuwaiti oil fields
were taken over by the government of Kuwaiti in the wake of the
formation of OPEC (Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries) in the 1970s.
<p>
Gulf refineries in Canada produced much of the oil that comes
out of Nigeria, Angola, Gabon and Zaire.
<p>
During the 1960/70 decade Gulf officials were engaged in
political bribery at home and abroad by means of a slush fund
that was funneled through a largely dormant subsidiary in the
Bahamas. The moneys were disbursed in the U.S. to Republican and
Democratic politicians alike.
<p>
In 1971 the fund was solicited for a $100,000 contribution to a
presidential campaign fund. (Nixon)
<p>
In Korea, where Gulf was constructing a huge refinery known as
the Pittsburgh of Korea, prominent political leaders demanded
extortion, one of whom in 1970 is said to have crudely demanded
$10 million of the president of Gulf stating, "I'm not here to
debate matters. You are either going to put up the goddamn money
or suffer the consequences."
<p>
Disclosure of the slush fund triggered a 364-page report
prepared by Gulf's attorneys at the insistence of the Securities
and Exchange Commission. Chevron purchased Gulf in 1984.
<p>
America's corporate structures in their devotion to profit are
above such considerations as family, country, war or morality.
Never was this more evident than in the development of the
finite energy resources of petroleum, natural gas and coal.
<p>
<em>EXXON</em>: Standard Oil of New Jersey (Exxon) is a product
of the ruthless and corrupt practices employed by John D.
Rockefeller in the destruction of competitors who refused to be
included in a monopoly controlover refining and transportation
of oil. It was reported that his younger brother, who was a
partner in a firm competing with Standard Oil, refused and was
forced into bankruptcy. It was reported, quote: "He eventually
moved his two children's bodies from the family burial plot in
Cleveland so they would not have to spend eternity in the
company of John D. Rockefeller. He remained bitter for the rest
of his life.
<p>
"Rockefeller looked back on this period with great piety. Late
in life he told a biographer that, 'The Standard was an angel of
mercy, protecting its less fortunate competitors from the risks
and hazards of the refining business.'"By 1880 Rockefeller was
refining 95% of the nation's oil. By 1885, 70% of Standard Oil's
sales were overseas. In 1888 he reorganized the trust as a
holding company. In 1911 the Supreme Court declared Standard Oil
an illegal monopoly. Out of its dissolution came 34 separate
companies. By 1980, 14 of the original 34 survived under new
logos, including Mobil, Exxon, Chevron, Amoco, Sohio.
<p>
As previously noted, in 1921 at the urging of Herbert Hoover and
the U.S. Department of State, Standard Oil of New Jersey
(EXXON), and Standard Oil of New York (MOBIL) became
participants in the formation of the first international oil
cartel, marking the start of American involvement in Middle East
oil.
<p>
In 1926 Jersey Standard and I.G. Farben chemical company of
Germany had made a secret research agreement. After Hitler came
into power in 1933, Jersey Standard gave Germany patents vital
to the production of aviation fuel.
<p>
In 1954, the U.S. Department of State once again came to the aid
of Jersey Standard. After the CIA-aided overthrow of the
government of Dr. Mohammed Mossadegh in Iran and the return to
power of the Shah, Jersey Standard was requested to participate
in organizing a new consortium to operate the Iranian oil
properties previously exploited by British Petroleum. Standard
Oil of New Jersey became EXXON in 1972.
<p>
The Middle East is a tangled web of intrigue and greed whose
aftermath has given us Iran/Contra, Desert Storm and the hidden
agenda of Somalia.
<p>
When Britain created Iraq in 1922 out of the spoils of the
defunct Ottoman Empire, it represented an amalgam of three
ethnically or religiously distinct former Turkish provinces:
Kurdish-domination Mosul in the north, Sunni Muslim Baghdad in
the center, and Shiite Muslim Basra in the south. Ever since
then, Iraqi history has been dominated by the struggle to
instill a greater national identity over these three rival
tribes.
<p>
Experts warn that the rising American drumbeat for war and for
the destruction of Hussein's regime demonstrates a dangerous
oversimplification of Iraq and the Middle East and the forces
that could be unleashed if fighting erupts. The fall of
Hussein's regime could lead to the balkanization of Iraq,
probably along the same Ottoman lines that existed before 1922.
Iraq's former name was Mesopotamia.
<p>
<em>CHEVRON</em>: In 1932 Standard Oil of California (CHEVRON or
SOCAL) struck oil on the Persian Gulf island of Bahrain and
obtained from King Ibn Saud the concession for oil fields on the
Arabian peninsula named after his clan, Saudi Arabia. In 1936
Chevron merged its production operations with the marketing and
refining facilities of Texaco to form CALTEX, a 50-50
partnership, to which later were added SOCALS concessions in
Sumatra, Java and New Guinea.
<p>
In 1937, at the height of the Spanish Civil War, Texaco supplied
Franco's fascist regime with oil. After the outbreak of World
War II it not only continued to ship oil to Germany, but in
June, 1940, it also provided an office and support to a Nazi
intelligence officer, a German lawyer named Dr. Gerhardt
Westrick, in their Chrysler Building headquarters. As published
in the new York Herald Tribune, his mission included a very
accurate review of the American aircraft industry prepared by
Texaco's economists.
<p>
Howard Scott's comments in 1950 in Cleveland, OH, describing
America's change in the direction of fascism, included the
critical details of exposure that ended the espionage at Texaco
in 1941 prior to Pearl Harbor.
<p>
In the 1990s Chevron disposed of approximately 1400 of its 1800
domestic oil fields resulting in a 20% decline in domestic oil
production from 1990 levels, slashed its work force by 2,500
jobs and in addition announced a pay freezeof its 20,000
nonunion employees.
<p>
Chevron's focus was on West Africa where the company inherited
operations as part of its purchase of Gulf Oil in 1984. Africa
now accounts for about two-thirds of its overseas' earnings. It
also has been expanding its tanker fleet to help ship more crude
between West Africa and the U.S. East Coast. This includes
Chevron's tanker, George Shultz. (Shultz is the former U.S.
Secretary of State and a Chevron director.)
<p>
In East Africa, prior to the overthrow of President Mohammed
Siad Barre January 1991, Chevron, Conoco, Amoco and Phillips
Petroleum reportedly were allocated exclusive concessions to
explore and exploittens of millions of acres of Somalia's
countryside.
<p>
Conoco Inc. permitted its Mogadishu corporate compound to be
transformed into a defacto American embassy a few days before
the U.S. Marines landed in the capital to bring pacification to
this tragic impoverished nation. A spokesmanfor Conoco Oil in
Houston described the arrangement as "a business relationship."
<p>
In April 1993 it was reported that Chevron signed a joint
venture contract dubbed Tengizchevroil, with the republic of
Kazakhstan to tap the oil-rich Tengis area on the northeast
shore of the Caspian Sea. It underscores the San Francisco based
Chevron's ongoing strategy of emphasizing foreign oil operations
while turning away from domestic drilling. The project is
expected to encourage similar oil-drilling ventures involving
Amoco, British Petroleum and Exxon among other oil giants and
former Soviet republics.

<a name="part3"> </a>
<p>
<em>Mobile: </em>Corporate strategy, power and ingenuity are not
lacking originality. In 1866 Vacuum Oil Company devised a method
for making kerosene by distilling crude oil in a vacuum. In 1882
Rockefeller bought the company and made it part of his newly
organized Standard Oil trust, of which Standard Oil Company of
New York (SOCONY) was the administrative arm.
<p>
In the early 1900s SOCONY developed a huge market in China by
introducing kerosene lamps. In 1926 SOCONY found a supplier for
all the kerosene lamps of china by buying General Petroleum,
which had oil wells in California's Central Valley and a 200-
mile pipeline (the world's first) to their refinery on the coast
near Los Angeles.
<p>
In 1931 SOCONY rejoined forces with Vacuum, its former associate
in the Standard Oil Trust, changing the company name to Socony-
Vacuum. In 1933, to serve their growing markets in the Far East,
they joined with Jersey Standard (now EXXON) in a venture called
Stanvac, paralleling the Caltex organization formed by Texaco
and California Standard.
<p>
Using Jersey Standard's oil wells and refinery in Indonesia and
Socony-Vacuum's huge marketing apparatus in the Far East,
Stanvac built an oil-selling operation in 50 countries that
spread from the east coast of Africa to New Zealand. Federal
trust busters broke up Stanvac, 1962, leaving each company with
half the assets of operation.
<p>
On December 2, 1823, President Monroe, in his annual message to
Congress, proposed a Doctrine containing four major points that
included (1) the American continents were no longer to be
considered as subjects for future colonization by European
powers (2) the U.S. would consider dangerous to its peace and
safety any attempt on the part of European powers to extend
their systems to any point in the Western Hemisphere.
<p>
A century later the creators of Trusts, holding companies and
multinational consortiums operate incognito, betraying public
trust and loyalty to country. Since August 1990, Presidential
exemption from federal conflict-of-interest laws was quietly
given by Bush to top federal administrative officials with a
financial interest in oil production, so that he could get their
"advice on policies and military measures." Eleven were exempted
with regard to the invasion of Kuwait and 13 in the Libya case.
<p>
It is a great distance beyond the historical boundaries of the
Monroe Doctrine and from the halls of Montezuma to the shores of
Tripoli. Was it the intent to establish navaland air bases to
make of the Mediterranean an American Mare Nostrum, thereby
assuring safe passage to the tanker fleets of the Six Sisters
and their plunder of oil riches from Africa's Third World
countries? The lives of too many American Marines have already
been sacrificed to this purpose.
<p>
Having engaged in the carnage and devastation, the death and
destruction of World War II, the resource position of
Continental United States is distinctly critical as
Technocracy's research and U.S. Department ofInterior data
revealed. It no longer has the capacity to "light all the lamps
of China", nor the mineral resources to furnish the exports for
the increased dollar profits of American business world-wide.
<p>
In the closing years of the 19th Century, a philosophic
justification for exploitive expansionism and class
stratification was provided by historians, professors, clergymen
and other intellectuals who found a basis for imperialism in
Charles Darwin's theories. It was a corruption of science, a
twisted, distorted contention that among nations, or "races", as
well as biologic species, there is an inborn struggle for
existence and only the fittest could survive. If the strong
dominated the weak, that was in accordance with the laws of
nature. It is an advocacy that has been arrogantly expressed and
enforced by dictators of all persuations.
<p>
The organic law of our nation, which was formulated in secret
session and under strict censorship, did not codify the
unalienable rights of all citizens. It is the anti-democratic
expression of intensely property conscious thinkers, and was
especially addressed to holdings in the more fluid forms of
capital investment, chiefly identified with commerce, finance,
and other speculative ventures. It is not a political Decalogue
but the politics of the lineal successors to medieval barons
imposed upon a disenfranchised majority. Plunderers were given
recognition and sanction in April 1789 when the Senate was
founded as the statutorygoverning body created to protect and
advance the exclusive interests of the accumulators of fiscal
wealth and property.
<p>
Cynically, in 1889 "it was the Senate of the Fifty-first
Congress, known ever since as 'The Millionaire's Club', that,
man for man, 'The Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle
for Life', (Darwin's subtitle for <em>The Origin of
Species</em>) seemed most splendidly confirmed. The finest
specimens of all, perhaps, were California's Senators, Leland
Stanford, one of the 'big four' who built the Central Pacific
Railroad, and gold-mining millionaire, George Hearst, father of
William Randolph...Senator Hearst once told a gathering of his
peers at dinner one evening, 'I do not know much about books. I
have not read very much; but...I made up my mind after all my
experience that the members of the Senate are the survival of
the fittest.'" (The Reconstruction of American History)
<p>
Southern Pacific, founded in 1861 as the Central Pacific
Railroad Company, "was one of the 19th centuries most avaricious
monopolies." It is reported that its creators' skill in the use
of "the time-honored techniques of graft, bribery, fraud,
outright mendacity, and mastery of political subversion"
inspired Frank Norris' 1901 novel, <em>The Octopus.</em>
<p>
The construction of the transcontinental railroad
represented an era of wanton corruption and Faustian debasement.
"Throughout the period, unscrupulous national state legislators
were openly bought and sold by the highest bidder., and during
Ulysses S. Grant's administrations (1869-1877), a large segment
of the Executive branch of the national government was viciously
corrupt. The Credit Mobilier, Union Pacific railroad's scandal--
involving amongothers, two Vice Presidents of the United States,
Schuyler Colfax and Henry Wilson, as well as a future President,
James A. Garfield--proved to be truly symptomatic of the times."
Scandal also attached to the operations of the Crocker
Corporation, responsible for the Central Pacific building.
(Encyclopedia of American History)

In American economic history the period at the turn of the 19th
century was known as the Steel Age (the Age of Metals), and the
era of Robber Barons whose corrupt, ruthless, predatory
proclivities were to become the prevailing mores of the 20th
century in America's society, nurturing the twisted ideology of
an imperial warfare-welfare State. It is a century of
political/economic jingoism whose most effective apostle of
commercial imperialism was Admiral Alfred Thayer Mahan, an
advocate of Sea Power. He envisioned a navy empowered to promote
and protect foreign trade, to take possession of colonies to
provide raw materials and markets and to serve as bases for the
military, "Whether they will or no," he proclaimed. (1897)
<p>
It was a military arrogance whose flawed calculations now
endanger our survival and continued evolution as a technological
culture. A century of unremitting warfare, internal strife,
explosive population growth, and conspicuous waste and
consumption has seriously depleted our strategic and critical
mineral resources, presenting a high vulnerability to foreign
influence. Of the 88 minerals the Bureau of Mines regularly
tracks, the U.S. imports over half ofits needs for 34 minerals.
<p>
These are the years of an elite ruling cadre and their aides-de-
camp, an interlocking directorate, a de facto government that
formulates the objectives, policies, strategy and dictates that
assure their powers of governance as an autarchy supplanting
existing elected political authority. A fait accompli by
America's Trojan Horse--the Cabinet. Whose master is to be
served?
<p>
An analysis of the U.S. Cabinet and the Corporate boards of
America indicate an interlocking directorate whose seats of
power have alternately been occupied by the same personnel,
whose stature included Secretaries of State, Defense, et al.
<p>
The ideology of America's multinational corporate structure, as
exemplified by major oil companies, is directed to a world
fascism as the research data in this report indicates, and as
charges filed in federalcourts throughout this century against
monopoly substantiate. It is time for Americans to accept their
duty as citizens by challenging the dictatorial control over
their destiny.
<p>
The elements exist to serve a new creative and fulfilling
doctrine of life that can transcend any written record of
humanity! We are the genesis, the agents of the future. The
forethought of Technocracy, under the guiding directionof Howard
Scott and the research of the Technical Alliance, has taken
science out of the laboratory to plan for a new social order
beyond anything the world has yet known. With knowledge, wisdom
and dedication, under its auspices, there is hardly a limit to
what the human species may creatively achieve!
<p>
It is a new system of governance, a Technate, a government of
function as the next peaceful evolutionary step in America's
destiny. The decision is yours to make.
