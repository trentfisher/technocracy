<p>
Of all the industrialized Western nations, not one has as
great a gulf between the rich and the poor as the United States.  Figures show
that 40 percent of the nation's wealth is concentrated in only one percent of
American households.
<p>
The United States is not only the most unequal nation in
the West when it comes to income and wealth, it is growing more unequal faster
than the other industrial countries, according to Edward Wolff, an economic
professor at New York University.
<p>
One-hundred percent of the increased wealth during the 1980s went to
the top 20 percent of American families.
<p>
<em>The present economic system is designed and structured for
plutocracy where the rich get richer and the rest of the American people are
merely pawns in the process.</em>
<p>
<h4>Voices in the Wilderness</h4>
<p>
About 40 million Americans live at or below the poverty level, including 12
million children where hunger is rampant.  Poverty in the midst of plenty is
the worst crime against humanity (human rights), and the government of the
United States must be held accountable as there is no excuse or reason for this
degradation of its own citizens.
<p>
Economic equality is the master key to non-violent independence...A non-violent
system of government is clearly an impossibility so long as the wide gulf
between the rich and hungry millions persist.  (From <cite>Against the Stream,
Critical Essays on Economics</cite>, by Gunnar Mydal, 1972-73.)
<p>
Today, both the Soviet Union and the United States predict and anticipate the
economic decline of the other.  Neither will be disappointed.  (Jane Jacobs,
<cite>Cities and Wealth of Nations</cite>, 1984.)
<p>
Militarism is the most energy-intensive, entropic
activity of humans since it converts stored energy and materials directly into
waste and destruction without any useful intervening fulfillment of basic human
needs.  (From <cite>The Politics of the Solar Age:  Alternatives to Economics
</cite> by Hazel Henderson, 1988.)
<p>
<em>For some unexplainable reason, countries seem to find a way to mobilize
their financial and natural resources for war but can't find the way to
mobilize their resources for meaningful pursuits and peace, or even make the
attempt to put their own house in order.  At this juncture in history, can any
of the countries in the world afford the luxury of squandering its remaining
resources on internal conflicts, limited or unlimited warfare?</em>
<p>
<h4>Peacekeepers and peacemakers: The biggest merchants of death and
world disorder</h4>
<p>
While chastising other countries and claiming to be in the forefront as
a peacekeeper and peacemaker, the U.S. share of arms to Third World countries
grew dramatically last year as new sales accounted for nearly $3 out of every
$4 spent, according to a report by the<cite> Congressional Research
Service.</cite>
<p>
U.S. sales made up 72.6 percent of all new sales to Third World countries, up
sharply from the 55.8 percent U.S. share in 1992.
<p>
Even though the Third World arms market has been shrinking since the end of
the Cold War, Third World countries contracted to buy $20.4 billion worth of
weapons last year.  Among the big buyers were Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, followed by
China, South Korea, Iran,Thailand and Malaysia along with Burma, Egypt and
Oman.  Most revealing, China, both an arms dealer and purchaser, was the third
largest weapons customer, signing agreements amounting to $1.3
billion.
<p>
The biggest arms and weapon suppliers in the world are the five permanent
members of the <i>U.N Security Council</i>, accounting for 86 percent of all
arms sales.
<p>
Russia, the United States, France, China and the United Kindom supply and sell
86 percent of the total weapons and arms, other nations 14 percent.
<p>
<em>How
ironic that the great peacemakers, who make the decisions and have the veto
power in the United Nations, are the largest death merchants in the world.  It
gives a person an idea as to who is calling the shots in the world arena, and
why certain foreign policies are followed.  A case in point:  While South Korea
becomes a lucrative arms market, North Korea becomes the whipping boy in the
process of drumming up new arms sales to South Korea.  The Rothchilds, the
Zaharoffs, the Krupps, the Duponts, Vickers, Remingtons, the Morgans and all
the rest were among the first to fine tune the war business into the most
lucrative racket that ever came down the pike.  As they say, business is
business, and business knows no enemies when it comes to making a
profit.</em>
<p>
Samuel Cummings of Interarms said, ``In the final analysis,
the morality of armaments boils down to who makes the sale.''
