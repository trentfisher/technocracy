<p>
A philosopher who anticipated the approaching nihilism that one
half century later was to become manifest in Fascism stated, ``In
individuals, insanity is rare, but in groups, parties, nations
and epochs, it is the rule.''
<p>
The name Homo sapiens was first conferred on mankind as a
zoological group by the great Swedish botanist and systematist,
Karl von Linne', (1707-78). ``Homo'' stands for the zoological
<strong>genus</strong> and ``sapiens'' for the zoological
<strong>species</strong> in toto meaning ``man the wise.''
<p>
Standing in the midst of the psychological and physical ruins of
some seven millenniums of civilization, surrounded by shattered
hope and burned-out creeds, man is of consummate arrogance and
hypocrisy to self proclaim his importance as central to the
creation of the cosmos and lay claim to the title ``sapiens.'' Of
all living species created upon Earth, Homo is Creations' most
ruthless and brutal predator, madness made evident.
<p>
Anthropologists identify the advent of ``Modern Man'' to the
Neolithic Age 6,500 B.C. Prior to that age ``there is no evidence
of the manufacture of weapons as instruments of offense or
defense against other men, --of war.'' That earlier era is
identified by anthropologists as based upon kinship from which
our language derived the
<p>
word ``kindliness'' meaning mutual aid. It is the proper mark of
society's civilization and the overt expression of the inner
civilization of Man.
<p>
The origin and development of kinship systems were identical
with the origin and development of the cooperative organization
in the earliest stages of human social evolution and extended
beyond genealogical lines until the boundaries of the community
were reached. Eventually the wholetribe became a unified,
integrated group of kindred living together on terms of mutual
aid and solidarity.            However crude and ineffectual
primitive cultures were in their control over the forces of
nature, they had worked out a system of human relationships that
has never been equaled since the Agricultural Revolution. The
warm substantial bonds of kinship united man with man. It was an
era in which human rights held precedence over property rights.
There were no lords or vassals, serfs or slaves, in kinship
society. In social ritual one man might make obeisance to
another, but no one kept another in bondage and lived upon the
fruits of his labor. There were no mortgages, rents, debtors, or
usurers, and no one was ever sent to prison for stealing food to
feed his children.
<p>
Those who look upon ``primitive man'' and his faith, formulas and
rituals as paganistic are lacking in knowledge and understanding
of cultural development. The fact is, they are purblind (or slow
to understand) to the hypocrisies, inhumanity and barbarism of
their own civilization.
<p>
In the Neolithic, the increase in the number of weapons found--
battle axes, rapiers and swords of bronze or iron--suggests that
either individuals or groups or both had made the sorry
discovery that by acquiring the property ofone's neighbor, one
could increase one's wealth, that war, in fact, was an
economically productive activity, a totally erroneous belief
that has bedeviled mankind down to the present day.
<p>
Witness our imperial Warfare State and its trillion dollar
budgets. It would be rather difficult to make a convincing case
for a higher evaluation of human life in modern nations as
compared with primitive tribes.
<p>
It was in the Neolithic that man started off on the wrong foot
with the discovery that the acquisition of large amounts of
property leads to power, and that when one has power the only
thing remaining to achieve is more power.
<p>
As Leslie White, Anthropologist, illustrates, the Agricultural
Revolution transformed primitive society, based upon kinship,
human  rights and human welfare into civil society, founded upon
property rights and territorial organization that were
impersonal, nonhuman and nonethical in character. Class
structure and class division replaced lineage and clan;
competition and conflict took the place of mutual aid. From the
standpoint of the needs and satisfactions of human beings, this
transformation meant a great loss; the loss of kinship.
<p>
Kindliness and mutual aid are life's most precious items and
cannot be measured on the material scales of society's weights
and measures. As for the dignity of man and the sacredness of
human life, what is one to say of social systems that condemn
the great majority to lifelong poverty and want, sometimes even
in the midst of plenty, that degrade Man and force him to beg
his daily bread? Or of ecocide and genocide? Of war and
preparations for war, in particular the hypocrisy of thosebased
upon a religious philosophy? The latter aberrations have existed
throughout the Neolithic age and into the 20th Century A.D. with
a full-panoplied pantheon of deities and other supernaturals to
justify their actions. Witness the religious wars, fanaticism
and hatreds extant today!
<p>
Primitive nonliterate man not only emphasized strength of
character, wisdom and loyalty to one's group, there was also a
sense of proportion characteristic of the nonliterates' world
view--the proper order of things in relation to each other. One
must learn the limits of the natural order, not only that one
may control it, but that one may obey it.
<p>
Every culture adapts its myths and legends embodying the beliefs
of a people, concerning Creation, gods, the universe, life and
death; and the myth-makers usually elect themselves as the
chosen people, or the first and originally created people. (In
this respect verify American political documents.) But primitive
cultures also included as members the doubters, usually in the
older grades, and those who referred to Creation as being long
before human memory, having occurred in ``Dream Time.''
<p>
The adapting by a culture of its folk tales and myths to its own
peculiar needs calls forth the following observations, quote:
``We find in religious philosophy a reflection of the real world;
the theology of a people will also echoa dominant note in their
terrestrial mode of life. A pastoral culture may find its images
in a Good Shepherd and his flock; an era of cathedral building
sees its God as a Great Architect; an age of commerce finds Him
with a ledger, jotting down moral debits and credits; emphasis
upon the profit system and the high-pressure salesmanship that
is required to make it function, picture Jesus as a super-
salesman; and, in an age of science, ``God is a god of law and
order'' (Millikan), a Great Scientist moving about in his cosmic
laboratory, his experiments to perform.
<p>
As a footnote, it is ironic that the author of the latter poetic
philosophy, Millikan, a physicist and Nobel prize winner, in
1933 when hunger, poverty and despair were prevalent in America,
did not propose to apply science to the social order.
<p>
Approximately a decade later the world's scientists gave of
their knowledge and efforts to the development of nihilism's
ultimate weapon that threatens the survival of all life upon our
Earth: an infectious psychosis germinated by a fundamentalist,
commercial, military and political ideology.
<p>
Also, it is one of our folklore's ironies, circa (9 B.C. - 5
B.C.) that the Earth's first homeless human couple was evicted
from Eden for having eaten the fruit of the tree of knowledge,
and in further retribution the land-Lord cursed the future
conception of their children.
<p>
The unquestioning acceptance as sacred dictum, a vindictive act
of censorship over thought, and a masochistic concept of
original sin, has seriously hindered the evolutionary
intellectual development ofour culture.
<p>
As a fitting, but inexplicable terminus to the innocent and
promising kinship world of family and solidarity, there appeared
a new, cerebral human. Where within and how does a high level of
intelligence originate and develop? Many questions, studies and
theories have been posited in seeking an answer. Is rationality
or its absence related to the brain, its size, weight or
configuration, or to the neural system? Or to some as yet
unknown or unrecognized locus?
<p>
If size of brain offers the greatest potential, then it reached
its zenith in the upper Paleolithic Age, 15,000-10,000 B.C. when
Cro-Magnon man existed.
<p>
Comparisons of brain sizes in cubic centimeters are as follows:
<p>
<em>Modern Man             1400c.c.
<p>
Neanderthal Man       1450c.c.
<p>
<em>Cro-Magnon Man      1660c.c</em>
<p>
</em>Cro-Magnons were considered the Apollos of the prehistoric
world, evolution's new promise, distinguished by their erect
stature and the physiognomy of modern man. They were about 5'11"
in height, having a high forehead, a well developed nose,
and a strong jaw. How they came about or what was their fate is
unknown. They made the most beautiful bone implements and are
believed to be the  people who made some of the masterly
paintings on the walls of caves and sculptures sometimes found
in them, which have been discovered in many different parts of
Europe. Perhaps the wall paintings in Lascaux cave, France are
the most famous of these. Their paintings and drawings are of
such astonishing competence that for almost 30 years after their
discovery, experts refused to accept them as the work of
prehistoric man.
<p>
The principal concerns of the research in this report are with
the origin  of our genus and their body of knowledge of the
Earth and the cosmos, including the properties of all sorts of
materialsand their uses during the course of their cultural
evolution. In particular this report is directed to identifying
the cradle of our Western civilization and the transitional
periods in the evolution of culture from a pastoral society to
our present technological structure and the psychological impact
that resulted in the erosion and destruction of family,
societies and nations.
<p>
Even as varieties of Homo sapiens' evolutionary development came
into existence, to either adapt to the environment to survive or
otherwise perish, so have  various cultures and languages over
the millenniacome into being that, as never before, today
require a mental unity of humanity for our survival and are
necessary to the harmony of the world.
<p>
Preliterate peoples knew their habitats intimately. They knew
what useful resources they contained. They knew the distribution
of flora and fauna and which species were useful or edible and
which were useless or injurious. They possessed knowledge
concerning the heavenly bodies and temporal and seasonal
sequences.
<p>
Virtually all kinds of tools were invented and developed, such
as knives, axes, scrapers, hammers, awls, needles, etc. All
techniques for producing fire known to man prior to the
invention of matches in the early 19th century A.D. were
developed by primitive peoples through percussion (flint and
iron pyrites), friction and compression. The fire piston
involved a principle that was later incorporated in the Diesel
engine where fuel is ignited in the cylinder by compression
rather than by an electric spark. They amassed a considerable
store of knowledge in chemistry. Medical diagnosis and practice
among primitive people were not wholly magical by any means.
<p>
Thus during the first hundreds of thousands of years of culture
history, primitive, preliterate peoples were acquiring realistic
and matter-of-fact knowledge and originating and perfecting
rational and effective techniques that laid the basis for
civilization and all (the higher cultures?).
<p>
The breakup of tribal society based upon kinship was attended
with confusion and violence. It was a grievous error to have
failed to grasp its major significance and thereby created a
distorted historical perspective of that period of ``Neolithic
time, (4000 B.C.)'' identified as the Agricultural Revolution. In
reality it was the most decisive and divisive moment in the
evolutionary development of Man--the founding of the Age of
Inhumanity, of Lupes est hom homini, an inversion translated,
``man is a wolf to man.'' It was there and then, in the cradle of
our Western civilization, that the greatestrevolution took
place, the creation of a new social system, the Price System,
and the dehumanization of man began with the control of human
beings as commodities. Thus were slavery, serfdom and social
control created and enforced in the Neolithic of what is now the
Middle East!
<p>
<a name="part2"> </a>
<p>
The earliest evidence of the domestication of plants is from a
people who occupied the Mount Carmel Caves in Palestine who date
back to 7,000 B.C. and appear to have occupied their caves until
about 5,000 B.C.  Among their implements were found the earliest
examples of agricultural tools, namely sickles.  They had no
other domestic animals than the dog.  The earliest agricultural
settlement known, and the earliest domestication of animals,
date back to Jarmo in northeastern Iraq about5,000 B.C., but it
did not attain a Neolithic culture altogether.  Both the
aforementioned are situated within the region known as the
``Fertile Crescent'', the vast semicircle of land that fringes the
great deserts from Palestine to the Persian Gulf.
<p>
Six or seven thousand years ago on the alluvial plains of the
Tigris and Euphrates rivers, people learned to raise abundant
crops in the desert by diverting river waters onto their fields.
The need to construct and maintain irrigation works, in turn,
provided strong impetus to the consolidation of social
organization by conscripting the labor of adjoining communities,
and the centralization of the economic system with the
accompanying centralizing of authority.  Any men who had any
ideas of cultivating their own plots were now coerced to work
under the threat of having their water supply cut off.  Large
surpluses of foodstuffs could now be accumulated and traded in
exchange for foreign goods.  This encouraged formation of the
first non-farming classes:  priests, administrators, warriors
and merchants, all of which had already been developed in
Mesopotamia, Egypt and the Indus Valley by 3,000 B.C.
<p>
A sociocultural system has ruled from the era of the great urban
cultures of antiquity, the church/States of the Sumerian and
Egyptian dynasties, the Greco and Holy Roman empires, to today's
American imperialism.  It is a system that constitutes the
lowest common denominator of the ability, intelligence and
necessities of humankind.
<p>
It was composed of a central government that enforced social
control and two main classes of society:  dominant and
subordinate, the dominant structure being the political rulers,
priests and military men.  In some States there was a class of
nobles who were the governors over districts of the Kingdom.  In
Babylonia mercantile oligarchies became powerful enough to rival
the priestly and military classes.
<p>
The subordinate class consisted of those who produced wealth by
the means of their labor, the urban and rural working class.
The former were craftsmen of various kinds; the latter
agriculturists who were serfs, slaves, and in some instances
free peasants.  Where a free peasantry existed, the people were
subject to taxation.
<p>
It has been stated that by 1400 B.C. most of the factors that we
associate with the modern State were in being.
<p>
<em>Pictographs:  </em>If two people agree that one is to supply
an ox in three months' time in return for which the other will
pay five jars of honey, pictures of the moon, the ox, the bee,
and the jar in addition to small strokes indicating the numbers
sufficed as tokens for them both as to the barter agreement.
<p>
<em>Written Language:  </em>Cuneiform 3500 B.C., Sumer in
Mesopotamia hieroglyphics 3000 B.C., Egypt.
<p>
Legal documents and commercial transactions were written in
wedge-shaped characters on cylinders and tablets of baked clay
called the cuneiform.
<p>
Probably much less than one percent of the population in these
ancient cultures could write, and among the literate the priests
were in a great majority.  But the art was gradually extended to
others:  to scribe commanders in the Egyptian armies, to foremen
of labor battalions, and to merchants.
<p>
The contract as a legal device for business transactions was
invented by Sumerian temple officials.  It was this document
that provided for the next transition in civil society that was
to give the Price System its distinctive character, the
development and expansion of trade and commerce based upon
commodity valuation and employing any form of debt tokens or
money.
<p>
It reinforced the class status of privilege and power and
control over others as exemplified by Hammurabi's Codes of Law,
Mosaic Law, British jurisprudence and the original political
framework of the American Constitution, which omitted a Bill of
Rights.  Over the decades this American Constitution gave
support to slavery, the exploitation of child labor, and ethnic
and sexual discrimination.  It disenfranchised millions by
giving property rights priority over human rights.
<p>
As conceived in the ratification of our Constitution, the Senate
was established as the advocate of property rights; its numbers
were not subject to the vote of the people until the 17th
Amendment, May 31, 1913.
<p>
In the 20th century A.D., in our society, it is time to apply
the Laws of Thermodynamics to our technological culture and our
mental energies toward bringing into realization the creative
potentialities of Homo sapiens.
<p>
With the exploitation of the natural resources in the Fertile
Crescent, a system of exchange, a monetary process, was
developed to meet the needs of the growth of commerce.  It
resulted in the division of society into debtors and creditors
and eventually into rich and poor.  As money became
distinguished from commodities, banking emerged as a definite
form and bankers as a class.  Banking, credit, interest rates
and debt tokens emerged within the 2nd millennia, B.C.
<p>
In Mesopotamia and Egypt the church temples served as banks and
the nucleus of capital accumulation, and the god of culture was
the chief capitalist of the land.  The Igibi bank of Babylon has
been compared with the Rothschilds of 19th century Europe.
<p>
Interest rates, which tended toward usury, further imprisoned
man in debt and the strictures of the class structure.  In
ancient Babylon, rates were 20 to 25 percent, Sumeria 15 to 33
percent, ancient Greece, 12 to 24 percent, and in Roman
provinces, 50 percent was not unusual.
<p>
Seals were used as debt tokens by 2200 B.C., and coinage was
used in 8th century B.C.
<p>
Money is but one of three great instruments of class division
and class rule, the other two being the indoctrination of belief
and physical force.
<p>
In the words of Horace, the poet and observer of the decadence
that was Rome (1 B.C.), it expresses the amorality of the Price
System that has increased in magnitude over the millennia:  ``Get
money by fair means if you can; if not, get money.''  Money has
no ultimate reality in itself but only is what it represents.
From its inception it has become a symbol of the concentrated
power of the ruling oligarchy who controls the means of life:
the resources of nature, extraneous energy, and the
technological means of production.
<p>
We, Homo Americanus, live in an era of irresponsible authority
and ignoble purpose, an era of prehistoric ooze, of ancient
social gargoyles and decadence, a clash of cultures and social
mores that are demeaning and destructive of Homo sapiens.  We
are an evolutionary anomaly in that we appear to have chosen the
path that leads to our own extinction.
<p>
The following reflects on an 18 page satirical ``Image'' report
entitled<strong> Let Them Eat Cake,</strong> by a prominent
fashion Editor of the Fourth Estate.
<p>
Nobody had ever seen anything like it...not in London since the
mad Hanovers.  Not since the time of Marie Antoinette and the
Revolution.  Not in Rome since the fall of the Empire has a city
indulged itself as has the City of Seven Hills.
<p>
The classical Roman architecture that houses the seats of
Government, its Opera House, Symphony Hall, the Museum of Modern
Art, Library, and their plazas was the scene of ``the most
outrageous week in San Francisco history,'' 1988 A.D.
<p>
Nine-hundred-seventy San Franciscans identified with great
exclusiveness, engraved and capitalized in Roman grandeur so as
to leave no doubt, as Society spent an estimated $11.5 million
in seven fabulous days on ostentatious display.  ``It was,'' in
the words of one grande dame, ``obscene.''  The money spent on
entertaining and fashion rivaled the operating budget of a
Fortune 500 company.  The excuse was the openings of the opera
and symphony.
<p>
The superficialities of Class in haute couture and glittering
baubles were in excessive display.  ``Designer dresses $1000 and
up, tails from a tailor $1000 and up, a bag $2,535, a scarf
$310, jeweled bracelets $120,000, drop earrings $175,000, a $1.5
million sapphire and diamond necklace, and a $2.5 million
anklet, to name a few.  A gala dinner for two $400, the best
seats for two $500.  Seating was sought as to pecking order and
publicity.''  P.S.  Some of our leaders begrudge a minimum wage
of $4.25 an hour to the hoi polloi.
<p>
If one needs further evidence as to the repudiation of the
abstract concepts of social conscience and social justice, the
aforementioned plazas, including the adjoining United Nations
Plaza facing the classic Roman colonnade of the Federal
Building, are the last sanctuary of the obliterated, the
casualties of the Price System, the nameless statistics, the
homeless, the children who have become Creation's discarded bits
of poetry on the garbage heaps of the world, the hungry, the
physically handicapped, the ill, and the unemployed.
<p>
As in Washington, D.C., identified as the crime capitol of the
world, the Federal seat of government in the City of St. Francis
is central to the Tenderloin, a dung heap of free enterprise in
drugs and prostitution, on the fringes of which are the soup
kitchens of the poor, in our land of contrived poverty amidst
plenty.  Therefore, in this environment, it should be of no
surprise that under the supervision and truncheons of the
police, the plazas serve as an open air Forum for discussions of
the many virulent symptoms of the ancient plague that is the
Price System.
<p>
It is the aforementioned type of ostentatious display and
irrational arrogance that incited the terrorism of the French
Revolution--and the burning of American cities.  Many historical
records verify the unresolved progressive instability of our
Nation, including the report of <strong>The National Advisory
Commission on Civil Disorders, </strong>1967 A.D.
<p>
Force, including militarism and warfare, also is our ancient
inheritance.  With the rise of urban culture in the Fertile
Crescent and the creation of the Price System and its class
structures, there also came into existence the military class
and the class of slaves, forming a major original nucleus of
social control that in succeeding millennia was adopted and
justified by other civilizations, including America, 1778 A.D.
<p>
Note:  Under the American Constitution, slaves were considered
to be three-fifths of a human being.  Indian populations living
in a primitive state were considered as being nonexistent.  Ten
Presidents were slave owners, and as President Lincoln made
clear, the Civil War was not over slavery but to preserve the
Union.  It also was a clash between two diverse Price System
competitors:  agrarian and industrial.
<p>
WARFARE
<p>
Slings and stones, used as ammunition, were found in Iran,
dating back to about 4500 B.C.  The first permanent military
organization was established in 2400 B.C. in Sumer, by Sargon,
who brought the land under one rule.  He introduced the practice
of enslaving the entire populations of subjected cities.
<p>
In the Old Kingdom of Egypt (2780-2100 B.C.), armies were
already using standardized weapons and marching in step.
Savages do not fight in such a fashion; therefore, there must
have been a long period during which the art of war was
developed.
<p>
CLASS STRUGGLES
<p>
The ruling oligarchy of these ancient Kingdoms engaged in
conspicuous waste and consumption while effectively preventing
the fruits of technological progress from being distributed
among the masses of the population.  Palaces, towers and temples
were constructed and loaded with wealth.  Vast treasures, and
even sacrificial retinue, were deposited in the tombs of Kings
and priestly rulers to accompany them to some mystical
destination.
<p>
An insurrection of the masses took place in Egypt as early as
2200 B.C. and again in the 20th Dynasty, 1100 B.C., and again in
the 20th Dynasty, 1100 B.C., that had their own origin in the
failure of the ruling classes to permit themasses to have
sufficient food.  (In 20th century A.D. America, this social
control is accomplished by maintaining an artificial scarcity in
the midst of plenty.)  Iranian peasants rose against the priests
and nobles in the Mazdakian revolt about 500  A.D., seizing land
and cattle and transforming their villages into communistic
communities.  A quarter of a million slaves rose in revolt in
Sicily in the 2nd century B.C.  They were starved into
submission, and thousands of them were crucified.  A slave
revolt in Italy led by Spartacus in 73 B.C. was eventually put
down on the field of battle; 6000 of his followers were
crucified along the Appian Way.  These are but a few examples of
the countless insurrections and uprisings throughout the length
and breadth of civil society for centuries on end.
<p>
Wars, conquest, and imperialism marked the development of the
great cultures of the Agricultural Revolution.  International
competition and conflict became intensified as their expanding
populations and cultures developed within therather fixed and
finite limits of natural resources.  Continued and repeated
destruction as a concomitant of chronic war and the ruthless
exploitation of both national and conquered lands through
slavery, tribute, and taxation eventually brought about the
decline and downfall of one nation and empire after another.
<p>
As has often been said, money is the sinews of war, and wars are
the weapons of commerce; and after their truce has been declared
the Price System extorts its reparations; the Market Place its
profits; and continued unquestioning belief its indulgences.
<p>
Only the dead draw no dividends from time's tomorrows.
<p>
Research reveals that from 1500 B.C. to 1860 A.D., no less than
about 8 thousand peace treaties were signed, each one supposed
to secure permanent peace, and each one lasting on an average of
two years.
<p>
Civilization connotes social organization of a high order,
marked by humaneness and accompanied by advances in the arts and
science.
<p>
Seven millennia of social conditioning have inured the survivors
of the human race to barbarism.  The 19th and 20th centuries
A.D. were America's years of ``infamy'', an unending history of
the dehumanization of man.  Years of internecine strife, civil
war and the sacrifice of its youth in continuous warfare to
perpetuate, enforce and extend the ancient ruthless, predatory
ideology of the Price System.
<p>
To that end it has accepted as expendable the sacrifice of 60
millions of North American lives in a calculated nuclear
holocaust.  To that end, it not only has granted absolution and
formed an alliance with the degenerates who were guilty of
genocide in World War II but now condones and encourages their
plunder of the finite heritage of the children of Homo
Americanus, including the unborn.
<p>
These were the years of a subrosa de facto government, of
undeclared wars and merchants of death and debt, of corrupt
cost-plus military contracts and ``the stone forests of the
dead'';  of Fort Knox gold and Fort Apache squalor, of the
suppression of economic dissidents and the advocates of reason
and peace as threats to the social system and its economic
royalties.
<p>
These were and are the years of distorted reality, and the
sordid betrayal of America's intellectual integrity, and of the
attempt by the Price System's dominant oligarchy to secure their
ruling powers and freeze the status quo of class division and
special privilege.
<p>
These are the years that were to set the example for today's
terrorism, of assault rifles, and rule by force in America's
uncivilized society; years when the Army of the Republic fired
upon poor war veterans and burned their shanty town on
Anacostia's mud flats; when the military clubbed and shot
students upon college campuses or were used as strike breakers,
denying workers their civil rights.  Years of revealed
corruptions of governance, courts of justice, private
enterprise, finance and the military.  This is the history of
the Price System.
<p>

<p>
With an unblemished brain having a neocortex that serves as the central
integrator for over-all adaptation, the possible number of network patterns
that could be formed, or paths that nerve impulses might travel, is far greater
than the total number of material particles in the universe. (Adaptation for
man must include creating, the ability to explore the new, and above all,
aspiration, and a neurological system made up of nerve fibers and neuron
chains, and with over 10 billion neurons in the human brain, and each of larger
ones having an average of more than 10 thousand connections, synapses from
other neurons.)  It is estimated that there are 50 trillion cells in the human
body.
<p>
What a tragedy that Man has become a distorted mutation, infecting
the intellect that has made him the creator of the predatory Price
System.
<p>
The disintegration of kinship society, nations, empires, and individual human
relations (including marriage) lies in the failure to attain intellectual
maturation. It is a failure to understand that within the emotional
distinctions made between ``I'' and ``thou'' (the separate entities of
apartheid) as applicable to individuals and nations, there are missing
the basic elements that bring about the potentialities for unity and
happiness as defined by the conjunctive ``we.'' It requires knowledge,
wisdom, and a selectivity, as in the evolutionary process, for the
development of individual or collective freedom, dignity and
integrity; and for the realization and expression of that variable
factor defined as ``love'' that thus far has not entered into the
resolution of differences that have arisen in human relations.
<p>
When we understand the paltriness of the competitive factors that separate us
as a people versus the potential richness that is ours when we unite in a
creative common purpose that the ``Laws of Nature'' freely offer, which makes for
peace as well as the fulfillment of creative aspirations, then we will be
worthy of the title Homo sapiens and our place in the evolutionary destiny of
the universe; and new wonders will begin to unfold for us.
<p>
Since its inception, our Nation was constituted as the Price System that has
governed man since the foundation of the first civil society. What is the
extortion it has paid in its submission to its predatory system and the legacy
left to its young and unborn generations?
<p>
It has enforced the mental status quo, achieved through the millennia of
indoctrination and the distortion of language, that has corrupted man and made
him capable of committing any heinous crime in obedience to his economic
system.
<p>
It has exchanged the sling stones of 4500 B.C. for thermonuclear weapons as a
more efficient method for man to murder his brother ``Abel.'' It has formed a
Warfare State, a political, military economic triad to promote its ideological
doctrine as a world fascism, preventing evolutionary social change or any
threat to its elitist power structure.
<p>
Its currency (blood money) represents the unconscionable destruction of
millions of human lives in war and, in a nebulous peace, the ever present
internal threat to our survival through the avaricious exploitation of our
natural resources under the economic cretinism of the conjurers of the 20th
century A.D., whose theory of exponential growth made a creed and social virtue
of greed and the Price System its divinity.
<p>
Article III, Section 3 of the Constitution should be amended to identify
the advocacy and implementation of the above elitist ideological doctrine as
contrary to the declared intent of our governance to guarantee the equal rights
to life and to promote the general welfare.
<p>
After two centuries America is now caught in a trap of its own contrivance.
The import and impact of the transition of America from the low-energy state of
an agrarian society to a high-energy state of industrial development are only
now made obvious by the vultures (domestic and foreign) who now prey upon its
disintegration. Just as nuclear weapons represent a quantum leap in the field
of destruction and their use in the destruction of humankind, so does the use
of extraneous energy and technology represent a quantum leap in the methods of
producing the material wealth of our Nation and in the process assure the
demise of the Price System. In both instances a new form of governance, based
upon a new method of operation and dedicated to creative principles that assure
the evolutionary continuance of life, is imperative.
<p>
The principle justification given for the existence and operation of our
technological mechanism is profit. But the specifications of its operation
proceed by way of the elimination of the worker/consumer whose purchasing power
under prior circumstances contributed to its continuance. As indicated on
Technocracy's chart, Man-hours and Production, the two long-time curves--the
growth of production and the decline of man-hours per unit of production, the
latter of which has seen a spectacular decline, identify the problem that is
insoluble under the profit motive.
<p>
Kilowatt hours of extraneous energy, technology, automation, robotization,
miniaturization and computerization have rendered not only the man-hours of
human productive effort obsolete but also the ``value'' and place of the
``corporate state'' and capital.
<p>
In 1985 the KWH costs of energy used in industrial and commercial endeavors
were 8.5 to 8.9 cents per KW. A human being at his best can do work only at the
rate of about one-tenth of a horsepower in a 10-hour day; one-tenth
HP=one-thirteenth KW. A kilowatt=1.3410 horsepower. It is also proven that KWH
will do productive work far in excess of the human man-hour, faster and better,
at a high load factor, and incorporate quality in its design. No cultural
system activated by human energy alone can develop very far.
<p>
The continuance of the Price System and profit motive has been made possible
only by wars, preparation for wars, foreign loans, extended credit,
subsidization and guarantees by government, planned obsolescence, artificially
created scarcity and the mortgaging of unborn generations.
<p>
The Gross National Product represents not only the degradation of our nation's
natural resources but also the degradation of its people as research
reveals:
<ul>
  <li>90 million illiterate and semi-literate American adults
  <li>36 million Americans are below the poverty threshold of
      $11,611. (A family of four)
  <li>14.3 million poor children in the U.S., the highest
      number since 1965.
  <li>56.1% of women with preschool children of necessity are in the
      work force.
  <li>2.25 million cases of child abuse were reported in 1988.
  <li>12.5 (plus or minus) million unemployed in 1987.
  <li>37 million Americans have no health insurance.
      (Congressional Budget office).
</ul>
<p>
Also included in the GNP America's other ``miserabilis'', war's forgotten
casualties, the mentally ill, the physically handicapped, the street people,
the prostitutes, the suicides, the victims of crime, and the millions who are
addicted to drugs as reported by the National Institute of Drug Abuse.
<p>
What legal or moral justification is there for the existence and continuation
of this degradation of humanity or for the political/business ideology that
fosters it? A new report from the United Nations Children's Fund challenges the
divine right of GNP to measure national prestige and progress stating,
``What if
a Nation's standing were measured not in dollars or missiles but by the
survival rate of its children.''
<p>
Furthermore, the GNP is the distorted language of ``voodoo economics.'' It
represents not the wealth of our Nation, but the exploitation and serious
depletion of our finite natural resources. Life is measured and limited by the
carrying capacity of the arable land, by its biotic potential, by every inch of
topsoil, each drop of water, kilowatt and extraneous energy, the minerals for
our technological society, and the human intelligence to sustain it and
equitably share it.
<p>
A system based upon exponential growth on a finite Earth cannot continue
without our destruction.
<p>
Without energy--the technology of production is silent; without the wealth of
natural resources--both energy and the productive mechanism are meaningless;
without the freedom to participate in the consumption of the production made
possible by the natural resources, energy and technology--life is impossible,
and equality, liberty, freedom, the pursuit of happiness and peace are
expressions of ignorance, arrogance and hypocricy--not democracy.
<p>
Man must be true to himself and to an unborn humanity, high in his mind,
faithful in his dedication, clear in his sight, that he may in his knowledge
and actions be society and a law unto himself. When private man shall act with
original creative views, the luster will be transformed from the actions of
corrupt predator chieftains to those of gentlemen, a Homo sapiens Americanus,
evolved from a perfect orchestration of creative scientific reasoning and
matter that gives access to a new tree of knowledge.
