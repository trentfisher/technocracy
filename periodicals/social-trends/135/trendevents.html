<h4>INTRODUCTION:  </h4>
The following information has been gleaned from a
number of publications and books that depict an insight and understanding of
what has happened over the years to the Earth's habitat and resource base, and
the impact on all life forms, including Homo sapiens and the survival of modern
civilization.  This information is followed by a summary and some conclusions
of why the United States and the rest of the world find themselves in this
paradoxical dilemma, and what might be done to prevent further damage,
degradation and devastation to the Earth's environmental and ecological systems
and its remaining natural resources.
<p>
<h4>RACING TO EXTINCTION</h4>
<p>
Each year, about 90 million new people swell the human population, now at 5.6
billion.
<p>
Massive food shortages will develop over the next 40 years as world population
increases to 8.9 billion by 2030.  It could reach 10 billion if the present
rate of population growth continues.
<p>
Nearly 2 billion people worldwide lack adequate and potable water, likely to
increase to 3.6 billion by 2000.
<p>
Poverty compels the world's 1.2 billion bottom-most poor to misuse their
environment and ravage what resources they have.  This in contrast with the
richest 1.3 billion who exploit and consume a disproportionate amount of
resources.
<p>
Whereas an average Bangladeshi consumes the equivalent of 3 barrels of oil
yearly, each American consumes an average of 55 barrels of oil each
year.
<p>
It is estimated that for every billion people that is added to this one and
only finite planet earth, it will require 250 million more acres of agriculture
land.  There are no more bountiful frontiers; they are long gone.  As the
stress on the habitat and the remaining natural resources increases, it will
create untold fragmentation.
<p>
Just to feed the whole world by the methods of the United States would require
80 percent of the world's total energy expenditure.  Western-style agriculture,
for all its spectacle, does not provide a suitable model for the rest of the
world to follow.
<p>
Ten million children died from nutritional-related diseases in 1993.  The UN
<i>Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) </i>reports that more than half (62
out of 115) of all developing nations will be unable to feed their projected
population by 2000.
<p>
<h4>LAND LOSS BECOMES ACUTE PROBLEM</h4>
<p>
Land loss and degradation is an acute problem worldwide.  Every year an
estimated 1.2 billion hectares, an area the size of China and India combined,
have lost much of their agricultural productivity since 1945.
<p>
Seventy-five nations have been experiencing a decline in food production per
capita during the 1980s.
<p>
America has already lost over half of its top soil, and, according to the
<i>American Farmland Trust</i>, continues to lose 2 million acreas of
its farmland to development every year.  Moreover, the U.S. loses an additional
3 billion tons of prime and irreplaceable top soil each year through wind and
water erosion.  Alternating between years of drought and floods, and with the
incessant soil erosion, America's farms are faced with an uncertain future.
<p>
<h4>FORESTS DISAPPEARING</h4>
<p>
The quest for more crop and grazing land has sealed the fate of much of the
world's tropical forests.
<p>
Between 1971 and 1986, forests shrank by at least 125 million hectares.  If
the current trend continues, most tropical forests will soon be destroyed or
damaged beyond recovery.
<p>
When both agricultural and nonagricultural needs are taken into account, human
populaton growth may be responsible for as much as 80 percent of the loss of
forest cover worldwide.
<p>
Half of the world depends for heating and cooking on fuelwood.  Since 1990,
100 million Third World residents have lacked sufficient fuelwood to meet their
daily energy requirements.
<p>
The other half of the world's wood is cut as timber and milled and processed
into boards, plywood, veneer, chipboard, paper, paperboard, and other products,
mostly in industrial countries.
<p>
In 1991, the world economy consumed 3.4 billion cubic meters of wood.  That
amount is 2.5 times as much wood as was used in 1950--one third more per
person.
<p>
At one time trees covered 26 percent of the land, but just 12 percent of the
earth's surface (one- third of the initial total) consists of intact forest
ecosystems now.
<p>
In nature's economy, forests play pivotal roles.  They provide habitat for
perhaps half of the 10 to 80 million forms of life on Earth.  Forests hold much
of the genetic information accumulated during 4 billion years of evolution.
They buffer the global climate against greenhouse warming and moderate local
climes.  They prevent floods and droughts, help keep pests in check, filter the
air, secure the soil and keep it out of the waterways, and nurture fisheries in
rivers and lakes.
<p>
The original forests of the United States covered about 43 percent of the
country, 48 percent of the open woodland of the Southwest included.  By 1880,
about 24 percent of the original eastern forest had been cleared for
farms.
<p>
By 1850, the country's "mainfest destiny" had been filled by expansion to the
Pacific Ocean.  It was during this expansion that forests were cleared away to
provide farm lands, huge logs of birch, beech, oak, walnut, maple, hickory,
pine and hemlock were piled up and burned.  Many trees were unnecessarily bled
to death in order to produce naval stores.  Vast acreages of forest were
cleared that were in no way suited to agriculture.
<p>
The last major forest regions of the United States (and many parts of the
world) have been drawn upon, and the limited extent of this most important
resource has become reasonably clear.  The end of virgin supplies is in
sight.
<p>
Because of technological application and new methods, along with the rapid
depletion of resources, those resource dependent towns and areas of the world's
forest zones, demonstrate that the future for these communities no longer lies
in extracting large quantities of timber, minerals and other raw materials.  In
the United States, for example, logging one million board feet of timber yields
only 3 jobs.  It is interesting to note that Japan will buy logs from the U. S.
without putting a tariff on them, but any finished wood products coming from
the U.S. to Japan have a heavy duty on them.  It is etimated that the crafting
of one million board feet of lumber will create 80 jobs.
<p>
<h4><a name="part2">Worldwide Degradation of Oceanic Systems</a></h4>
Increasing coastal population (3.6 billion in 1990) and development
has triggered widespread resource degradation and serious coastal pollution
worldwide, resulting in the plundering of the world's most productive
ecosystem.
<p>
Human and industrial activities may be responsible for as much as 35 million
metric tons of nitrogen and up to 3.75 million tons of phosphorous flowing into
the coastal waters, causing massive algal blooms and the depletion of oxygen
levels, harming all marine life near the shores.
<p>
At the present rate of degradation, it is estimated that 70 percent of the
world's reefs will be gone or beyond recognition in 20 to 40 years.  Only 30
percent, now located away from development, are in stable condition.
<p>
All of the 17 major fishing areas in the world have reached or exceeded
natural limits.  Coastal fisheries have been overexploited, are in serious
decline or have collapsed.
<p>
Marine photosynthesis is at the foundation of the oceanic systems that yield
80 million tons of seafood per year.  Globally, the marine catch accounts for
16 percent of animal-protein consumption, and is an important source of protein
in developing countries.  In Asia, one billion people rely on fish as a food
supply, as do many people in island and coastal nations of Africa.  By not
treating the oceans and seas of the world in a wholesome manner and recognizing
how necessary they are to the ecosystem, our survival as a species could be
jeopardized.
<p>
<h4>Water: Our Most Precious Resource</h4>
<p>
Through the energy provided by the sun, water evaporates from the oceans and
the land, is carried as vapor in the air, falls somewhere as rain or snow, and
returns to the oceans or to the land again to go through the same
process.
<p>
Only about 0.01 percent of the world's total water is easily available for
human use.  The world is divided into water "haves" and "have nots."
<p>
As the world's human population increases, the amount of water available per
person decreases.  The amount of water available per person has shrunk from
more than 33,000 cubic meters (1.2 million cu.ft.) per year in 1850 to only
8,500 cubic meters (300,000 cu.ft.) today.  It is estimated that because of
population growth alone, by the year 2000 water demand in more than half the
world's countries is likely to be twice what it was as recently as 1971.
Already some 2 billion people in 80 countries must live with water constraints.
(Japan recently had to ship water from Alaska.)
<p>
By 2025 some 48 nations will suffer water shortages.  According to Qu Geping,
China's Environmental Minister, the country can supply water <u>sustainably</u>
to only 650 million people, not the current population of 1.2 billion.  As are
many nations throughout the world, China is drawing down its groundwater
supplies and overusing surface waters beyond replenishment.
<p>
The United States withdraws an estimated 339 billion gallons of fresh water a
day from lakes, rivers, streams and underground sources.  America remains among
the biggest water users.
<p>
Hidden from view, groundwater is the source for half of U.S. drinking water;
in rural areas, about 96 percent.  Roughly 65 percent of the groundwater
withdrawn in the U.S. is used for irrigation.  Overpumping has caused
groundwater levels to drop in some critical areas to the point that is beyond
replenishment.  A most critical problem continues to be the control of the ever
increasing quantities of harmful pollutant runoff from farms, cities, industry,
construction sites and mines that contaminate the underground aquifers and
other water sources.
<p>
A report by the National Resources Defense Council points out that during 1992
and 1993  nearly one in five Americans drank water from systems that either
violated health standards or failed to test drinking water and report the tests
as required by federal law.
<p>
According to NRDC and a number of environmental organizations, the U.S. Senate
and the House of Representatives weakened the Safe Drinking Water Act at a time
when stricter regulations are needed.  The seriousness of the problem, such as
harmful bacteria, cancer-causing chemicals, lead and other dangerous
contaminants in the water, didn't concern Congress even when epidemics broke
out in the cities and other areas of the country.
<p>
<h4>FOSSIL FUELS:  CONSUMPTION WITHOUT ANY COMPUNCTIONS</h4>
<p>
Human society runs on energy, principally fossil fuels, such as oil, gas and
coal.  These three sources account for 90 percent of the global commercial
energy production.  Nuclear power, hydro-electricity and other sources provide
the rest.
<p>
The industrial nations, with less than 25 percent of the world's population,
burn or consume 70 percent of all fossil fuels.  The United States, with about
6 percent of the world's population, consumes approximately 25 percent of the
world's energy.  Each American (per capita) uses the energy equivalent of 55
barrels of oil yearly.
<p>
The combustion from oil emitted 2.4 billion tons of carbon in 1993.  Much of
the oil is burned by motor vehicles, a most inefficient means of
transportation.
<p>
The world's addiction to fossil fuels, especially among the industrial
nations, has resulted in chronic, sometimes catastrophic, and harmful pollution
of the air, water and land, and in most cases beyond what the ecosystems, the
environment and man-made structures can tolerate.  The hazardous mix of
pollutants -- everything from sulfur dioxide and reactive hydrocarbons to heavy
metals -- has a deleterious effect on the health of the people and the nations
of the world.
<p>
<h4><a name="part3">The Oil Industry: Too big to be called to account</a></h4>
<p>
In this industrial and technological age, oil is the most important and
profitable commodity in the world.  The value of the oil trade is greater than
all other raw materials combined.  It is estimated that half of the tonnage on
the oceans and high seas consist of petroleum.  While about 15 billion barrels
are discovered per year, the world consumes approximately 20 billion barrels a
year.  The U.S. expenditures for energy comes to about $450 billion a year;
over half of that amount is for petroleum products.  The trucks and automobiles
in the United States burn around 7.5 million gallons of gasoline and 8.5
million gallons of motor fuel a day.
<p>
In spite of the nationalization of their oil fields by the producing nations,
once under the control of the Seven Sisters, the major world oil companies,
even with OPEC, are still the main players in the petroleum business.  They
have  branched out where they now own or control most of the gas, coal and
uranium deposits.  The major oil companies have sales (GNP) and assets bigger
than many countries throughout the world -- an industry that dwarfs the biggest
megacorporations.
<p>
The American people should not expect that a comprehensive conservation energy
program will ever be implemented under the present economic system, or any
drastic reduction in pollution and hazardous waste by-products, nor the return
soon of what is left of America's heritage to the nation and the people.  The
sop that comes by way of an understaffed, underfunded and Congressional
controlled EPA is just about all the nation and the American people can expect
from a financial-structured economy, an economy where politicians are concerned
only with their personal aggrandizement and the perpetuation of the system that
makes it possible.
<p>
For what reason or purpose, and what would be the consequences by continuing
the development and increasing the energy production and consumption at a
higher level than has already been obtained in the industrial and technological
societies?  Just to produce more obsolescence, waste and junk, and use more of
the world's depleted resources to maintain this highly inefficient system.?
<p>
<h4>THE ONGOING NUCLEAR MENACE</h4>
<p>
More than 430 commercial nuclear reactors operate in 28 countries, providing
about 17 percent of the world's electricity.  The 109 reactors in operation in
the United States have created 22,000 tons of spent fuel, according to the
Department of Energy.  By the year 2000, the amount will increase to an
estimated 40,000 tons.  This stuff (spent nuclear waste) won't go away: not
tomorrow, not in a century, not in 25,000 years.  Spent nuclear fuel or waste
is highly radioactive and dangerous to handle, insulate and store.  As of yet,
there is no safe way to dispose of this hazardous and highly volatile waste
material.
<p>
The development of nuclear energy and the production of thousands of nuclear
bombs and warheads may have deterred the Soviet Union (if that was the real
purpose behind this policy), but in reality and in the final analysis this
abomination created nothing more than an uncontrollable menace for the United
States and the world for centuries to come.
<p>
Creating and capitalizing on calamity is an inherent characteristic of the
financial and monetary system.  There can be no doubt that this nuclear
aberration will be used by the entrepreneurial and political opportunists and
the various vested interests in any manner possible as long as there is a
profit to be gained.
<p>
The ideological folly of the Cold War resulted in one of the largest parasitic
waste of natural and essential resources in the history of the world and has
from its financial cost brought about a situation where the United States has
become the largest debtor nation in the world, and its economy has been kept
afloat by the mere creation of mega amounts of debt.  As for the former Soviet
Union, it is in a state of economic disarray and fragmented.
<p>
Had the United States mobilized all of its natural and human resources
following World War II for the reconstruction and redesigning of  its social
and technological structure for constructive instead of destructive pursuits,
the country and the American people would have been enjoying economic stability
and peace with the world for the past half century.  But nobody listened or
paid attention (the same today) to those few concerned and conscientious voices
in the wilderness who let it be known that there is a meaningful and positive
alternative to a policy that leads the nation to a dead end.
<p>
For a country that was once endowed with the greatest array of natural
resources in the world, and the beneficiary of these resources that took eons
for the forces of nature to create, the United States in its short history has
used and wasted these resources as if they were unlimited.  Manifest destiny,
the movement across the land from the Atlantic to the Pacific ocean, with its
wanton destruction and devastation of the country's resources in the process
became the pattern for future development and discoveries.
<p>
<h4>Conclusion:</h4>
<p>
Instead of the industrial and agricultural revolution benefiting humanity, and
instead of the resources, discoveries and technology being developed and used
in a meaningful and efficient manner to provide and sustain a decent and
quality lifestyle, the United States and the other industrial nations have
plundered and continue to plunder what is left of theirs and the world's
natural resources.  In the process they have misused the technology and the
scientific innovations and discoveries to produce mere obsolescence, mountains
of waste of all kinds, creating irreplaceable and irreversible damage to the
environment and ecosystems, including the health of their nations and the
world.
<p>
Adding to the burdens of the world is the ever increasing rate in the growth
of population.  The figures are staggering, amounting to the equivalent of over
90 new cities of a million people every year.  At the present rate of growth,
the population of the world of 5.6 billion today will increase to about 8.5
billion by 2025.  The carrying capacity of this Earth is already beyond its
limits of sustainability, and the way the remaining natural resources are being
devoured, the task of dealing with this ongoing crisis does not present an easy
solution, not when there are already tens of millions of people worldwide
living in poverty, just holding on and suffering from chronic malnutrition and
hunger.  Compounding the magnitude of the problem is the estimated 49 million
refugees who have been put to flight by wars, internal conflicts and
famine.
<p>
What makes the situation more precarious, there are no new or bountiful
frontiers left on this planet Earth.  The search for new productive and
sustainable agricultural areas is over.  Any plans or thoughts to farm the
Amazon basin must be treated with extreme caution.  The top soil is very
fragile and only a few inches deep, easily eroded and not conducive to farming
or cattle raising.  To continue to destroy the rain forest, or any forests
without forethought, will have a serious impact and long-term effect on the
land and all life forms throughout the world.  The wanton destruction, the
unnecessary uses of wood and the high rate of depletion of the forests over the
years should put to rest the conviction that the timber supplies of the world
are inexhaustible.
<p>
Commercial and military dominance, the superpower complex, acts as a shield
for the financial and political interests against any consideration of the
physical realities of this overexploited world; it totally disregards the
Earth's resource limitations.  Just to base world trade agreements on growth,
investments and profitable considerations, and in the process using the Earth's
resources indiscriminately by dumping a glut of goods and services on the world
market compounds stupidity and makes any positive alternative remote.  When a
country like the United States produces more goods than it can distribute to
its own citizens, it is time to look inward, not outward.
<p>
Unless the United States and the other nations of the world can disengage and
make a complete transition from the financial and monetary system and implement
a method of operation that is compatible with physical reality, then the decay
and decline of modern civilization and our own demise becomes inevitable.
