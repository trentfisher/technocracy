How does it feel to be killed softly?  What a strange way to keep the
peace:  weapons that are kinder, gentler, a post-cold war strategy
emerging from the U. S. Government's secret &quot;black budget.&quot;
Perhaps if these technology experts can come up with enough non-lethal
weapons that &quot;disable or destroy&quot; without causing too much
injury or damage, they can make war seem almost palatable and get on
with their fun and games.
<p>
Here is a non-lethal laundry list described for the public:  
<p>
(Excerpted from September/October 1994  issue of<i>  The Bulletin of
Atomic Scientists</i> from an article written by Steven Aftergood,
Physicist.)
<p>
<b>Infrasound:  </b>Very low-frequency sound generators could be tuned
to incapacitate humans, causing disorientation, nausea, vomiting, or
bowel spasms.
<p>
<b>Laser weapons:  </b>Low-energy laser rifles could dazzle or
temporarily blind enemy soldiers, or disable optical and infrared
systems used for target acquisition, tracking, night vision, and range
finding.
<p>
<b>Supercaustics:  </b>These highly acidic chemical agents can be
millions of times more caustic than hydrofluoric acid.  They could
destroy the optics of heavily armored vehicles, as well as tires and
structural metals.
<p>
<b>Biological agents:  </b>Microbial cultures can be
&quot;designed&quot; to chew up almost anything.  Scientists at Los
Alamos National Laboratory reviewed naturally occurring organisms that
could be cultured to enhance certain characteristics.  &quot;As a
result, we discovered a bacterium that degrades a specific material
used in many weapons systems.&quot;
<p>
<b>Acoustic beam weapons:  </b>High frequency acoustic
&quot;bullets&quot; used against people would induce blunt-object
trauma &quot;like being hit by a baseball.&quot;  According to a
special technologies expert at Los Alamos, &quot;Proof of principle
has been established; we can make relatively compact acoustic
weapons.&quot;
<p>
<b>Combustion inhibitors:  </b>Chemical agents can be released into
the atmosphere or introduced directly into fuel tanks to contaminate
fuel or change its viscosity to degrade or disable all mechanical
devices powered by combustion.
<p>
<b>Mini-nukes:  </b> Mini-nuclear weapons with explosive yields of 100
tons (&quot;The 'Soft Kill' Solution,&quot; March/April 1994
<i>Bulletin</i>).
<p>
Among the many other technologies under consideration in the
Pentagon's non-lethal program are sticky foams to immobilize
individuals, anti-traction chemicals to slicken roads and runways,
high-power microwave generators, mechanical entanglements, holographic
projectors, non-nuclear electromagnetic pulse generators, neural
inhibitors, and wireless stun devices.
<p>
Now why can't these technology specialists work to find ways to
enhance life instead of destroy...oh, oh.  Mustn't forget that these
new weapons are supposed to be non-lethal; even so, if they were
actually put to use, they would certainly play havoc with natural
resources not to mention promoting business for the nearest unscathed
medical associations.
