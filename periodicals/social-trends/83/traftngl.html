Political mismanagement is not endemic to the states of Oregon
and Washington; it thrives wherever political forces attempt to
master technological problems.  However, since the author knows
Oregon and Washington best, why not zero in on the home front.
After all, if you've seen one Price System state, you've seen
them all.
<p>
<blockquote>
<em>
Most people are not familiar with the term, Price
System.  If you mention the word money, profit, or bottom line,
they understand.  Technocracy defines a Price System as any
system that operates on debt and uses a medium of exchange to
distribute goods and services.  Except for a possible remote and
primitive community, none other than Price Systems exist at the
present time.  So, call it what you will:  profit, money, or
bottom-line systems--or Price System; they are one and the
same.
</em>
</blockquote>
<p>
Oregon and Washington seem to be awakening to the fact that
there may be a traffic problem.  This is the third awakening in
recent times.  The first one came when a couple of decades or so
ago it was decided to build another I-5 Bridge adjacent to the
existing one that connects Portland, Oregon and Vancouver,
Washington.  (The state boundary line runs parallel down the
center of the Columbia River, so if you want to swim there,
you'd best use the Oregon side.  Oregonians are more
ecology-minded.)
<p>
One bridge would carry traffic south, and the other would carry
traffic north instead of one bridge carrying the full load.
Toll booths were installed, and commuters footed the bill.
Miraculously the toll booths were removed when the bridge was
paid for, as promised, and earlier than expected.  In other
words, more traffic crossed the bridge than the experts
predicted.  By the time the new bridge was paid for, traffic had
increased enough to create almost as many traffic jams as there
were before the new bridge was built.
<p>
Several years later came awakening number two.  The baby boomers
were coming of age and outsiders were drifting into Oregon and
Washington in search of another Walden Pond.  Privacy became a
premium.  Clearly another new bridge was in order.  Why not
connect the two cities farther east!  This would give interstate
commuters on that side of the tracks a decided advantage.  In
fact, it would be an advantage for everyone.  More lanes would
be installed.  The bridge would be built high enough to
eliminate the need for lifting it for small boats with tall
flagpoles, a constant irritation to commuters on the I-5 bridge.
There would never be a traffic jam on the new I-205 bridge.
After several years of bickering and planning, the new project,
which would solve all traffic problems, got under way.  The
experts were right about one thing:  There is never a traffic
jam on the I-205 bridge.  However, when you take an exit off the
main drag in an attempt to reach the city center or outlying
districts of Portland, you can get caught up in gridlock on
access routes any time of the night or day, especially if the I-
5 bridge is jammed; when this happens, like ants after having
their nest disturbed, commuters who haven't yet got caught up in
the gridlock run around in a frenzy, looking for an escape
route.
<p>
And wouldn't you know it.  Once again interstate commuters are
experiencing traffic jams on the I-5 Bridge.  Due to attempted
improvements in an effort to alleviate this congestion, road
crews become part of the problem; they work from eight to five
also. Commuters had better get an early start if they don't want
to be late for work.
<p>
It is estimated that rapid growth will dump a half-million more
cars and trucks onto the roads of Oregon and Washington--one for
every new resident--in the next 20 years.  Some commuters, who
used to make it to work in 20 to 30 minutes, now find it is
taking them 40 minutes to an hour.  Although the bridge
improvement has helped them get from one state to the other, the
merging traffic on main avenues to and through the city center
and outlying districts is a daily, aggravating, time-consuming
stop-and-go-affair.
<p>
So awakening number three is now on the agenda.  "STEP ON THE
GAS--GRIDLOCK'S COMING" warn the headlines of the April 29, 1990
<cite>Sunday Oregonian</cite>.  "To pave
the way ahead, the Metropolitan Service District has a plan to
build new highways, widen old ones, build new light-rail lines,
double bus service and explore alternatives such as carpooling
and flextime."  Ah, that last one, "flextime";  that might do
the trick.  The other plans have been tried before and failed.
(It will be interesting to see how the city fathers manage their
version of a balanced load--flextime.)
<p>
One week later the May 6, 1990 issue of the <cite>Sunday
Oregonian</cite> explored the housing boom.  Aha!  Now we find
out that it's those awful Californians who are sneaking into
Oregon and Washington and causing these terrible traffic
problems, all because they can purchase housing here much much
cheaper than in California.  "Not since the buying bonanza of
Oregon's prosperous 1970s has real estate been in such demand.
Fueling this frenzy are out-of-state dollars owned by equity-
rich newcomers, a third of who hail from California.  The influx
has sparked a surge in housing construction, most of it tailored
for buyers who think nothing of paying $150,000 and more for
their abodes," boasts the <cite>Sunday Oregonian</cite>.
<p>
The question arises:  Will Oregon and Washington become another
California?  The Golden State's population explosion lasted more
than 30 years, leaving a plethora of housing, traffic and public
service problems in its polluted wake.
<p>
Only in a system where profit is all that counts can you find
people cheering the building boom while cursing the influx of
newcomers--and the resultant traffic jams--, where if it wasn't
for the newcomers, there would be no building boom.  "Ain't it
great to be crazy!"
<p>
In his bid for the presidency, Herbert Hoover promised the
people of this nation a "chicken in every pot and a car in every
garage!"  Now building contractors are coming up with "a garage
for every car whether there is anything left for the pot or
not."  In the <cite>Homes </cite>section of the Sunday
<cite>Oregonian</cite>, it is not unusual to see houses
pictured with three-car garages built on as an extension of the
house.
<p>
Today the increase in traffic congestion has reached the point
where bridges, by-passes, overpasses, underpasses, freeways and
their merges on and off are obsolete by the time they are
completed.  Well heck!  Maybe we just haven't voted in the right
legislators yet.  And what about the opinion of the people?
After all, they're the ones carrying on a love affair with their
cars, frenzied on by advertising and the need for social
prestige.  Let's take a poll, get up a petition, put it to a
vote.  Just get this problem ironed out by the real freeway
experts and hand it over to the engineers to implement.  And
engineers make perfect scapegoats when things go wrong.
<p>
In the late 1940s, proposals were put forth in many major cities
for wider streets, arcaded sidewalks, more traffic lights,
synchronized traffic lights, more restricted parking, moveable
curbs in principal streets to allow reversible traffic lanes for
rush-hours, one-way traffic on specified streets and at
specified hours, sunken speedways with no level crossings, more
traffic police, etc.  Specific suggestions directed at parking
problems included underground parking, overhead parking, more
garages, decentralized business, fringe parking with bus
transportation from the outlying parking lots to the business
section, city owned parking space for one car for each unit area
of floor space, more parking meters, more traffic police...
This sad song ends periodically, but its haunting melody lingers
on until the experts try playing it again.
<p>
Suppose that automobile buffs looked at their prized possessions
from the scientist or engineer's viewpoint.  The automobile is
primarily a means of transportation, not a piece of property.
Considering automobiles from this standpoint, it should be
evident that there are far too many of them. In this country
alone, more than 11 million new cars ventured onto the already
overcrowded roads during 1986.  And car ownership is still
steadily rising despite economic recession and increased oil
prices.  Because it is more profitable to sell automobiles as
property than to sell transportation, property and ownership are
played up by auto manufacturers and dealers.  Attractive gadgets
and accessories are added as "selling points", and other
prestige factors are stressed.  The public doesn't give a care
who owns the trains, ships or planes, but by gosh their cars are
considered valuable personal property.  To heck with efficient,
non-polluting transportation.
<p>
Today's traffic congestion is only one of the many symptoms that
show the inadequacy of a Price System method of social operation
in a technological age.  Any attempt to operate automobile
transportation on an engineering basis would be doomed to
failure unless all other sequences of operation affecting it
were placed on the same basis.  Since in North America today our
entire technological operation is interdependent, it follows
that only with a plan of overall technological administration
will we be able to do anything concrete toward solving our
serious traffic tangles.
<p>
In the meantime, Oregonians and Washingtonians can continue to
blame those invading Californians for their traffic woes.  In
fact, the smog is getting so thick around here, it tends to
settle between the ears.  This will become more evident when
awakening number four arrives.
