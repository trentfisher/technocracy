The spin doctors, the lobbyists, the
politicians and who's who in the financial and megacorporation
world are beating the media drums to let the American people
know what a great opportunity the North America Free Trade
Agreement will be for the United States, Canada and Mexico.
<p>
While all kinds of arguments have been presented as to the
advantages of a common market for the North American Continent,
there has not been a comprehensive impact report as to what
effect the implementation would have on the environment, the
resource base and the infrastructural changes that will be
necessary under NAFTA.
<p>
In general terms, the report mentions the fact that more trade
will mean that more raw materials and goods will be transported
around the world and will result in the use of more energy and
cause more pollution. For instance, the transporting of 4
billion tons of freight sent world-wide in 1991 required 8.1
exajoules of energy, which is as much energy used by the entire
economies of Brazil and Turkey. It should be worth mentioning
that with the European community trade agreement, the crossing
of their borders by truck traffic will increase the air
pollution by 30 to 50 percent during 1993. Other vehicles, boat
and airplane traffic will add to the pollution factor and the
consumption of more energy and other irreplaceable resources.
<p>
What will the impact be on the North American Continent if NAFTA
is implemented? Cross-border trucking between the United States
and Mexico has doubled in the last five years, reaching at least
1.8 million crossings per year. The U.S. government predicts
that when NAFTA comes on line there will be 12 million trucks
crossing the borders of the U.S. and Mexico--nearly seven times
the present volume by the end of the decade. This would mean
greater trafficcongestion, increased fuel consumption, air
pollution and carbon emissions, and more vehicle accidents
involving trucks carrying inflammable and hazardous cargos.
<p>
The Worldwatch paper refers to a study by Princeton University
economists, Gene Grossman and Alan Krueger, who found out in
their research that the volume of trade and
investmentliberalization envisioned under NAFTA would increase
annual toxic emissions into the air, water and land--from all
industrial sources-- by 10.5 million pounds in Mexico, 13
million pounds in theU.S., and 8 million pounds in Canada.
<p>
The United States operates under an economic system that must
have expansion, growth and investments to survive. Lacking a
viable distribution system, it must create artificial scarcity
or find another country, or somewhere to dumpits surpluses to
keep the system going. When calculating the Gross Domestic
Product, the amount in dollars of all goods and services
produced in the U.S., the cost to the nation in environmental
degradation and damage, the depletion and exploitation of the
country's resource reserves, the overall damage to the
infrastructure and the health of the nation and its people are
never included in the total cost for obvious reasons. NAFTA
would only compound the myriad of unsolved problems that already
exist from operating under a financial and monetary structure.
It is doubtful that the power brokers and the megacorporate
elite will ever come up with any idea or plan for the
coordination and mobilization of the continent's resources and
technology for the purpose of meeting the physical requirements
of the social and industrial mechanism and the welfare of the
people.
