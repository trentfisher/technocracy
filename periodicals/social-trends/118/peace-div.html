When the wall came down and the Cold War ritual became
unfashionable, it brought about a euphoria that had not been
experienced since the end of World War II. From this
breakthrough it was thought that the nation could direct its
attention and priorities toward putting its own house in order
after more than four decades of neglect and deterioration.
<p>
Just to get some idea of what the Cold War entailed in cost
alone defies the imagination. During over four decades of
pursuing a policy of containment and encirclement of the Soviet
Union, the government spent about $10.5 trillion of American
taxpayers' money on "defense", an amount equal to replacing the
entire infrastructure of the country or two and a half times the
present national debt. But with no enemy of the stature of the
previous superpower, there became no reason or need for the
nation to continue huge military expenditures.
<p>
With the Cold War over, there were reports that government
expenditures for defense and the military could be cut as much
as a half, and that the savings, called the Peace Dividend,
could be applied to more useful and beneficial purposes. But for
reasons to be enumerated, the Peace Dividend was scuttled,
nipped in the bud before it started.
<p>
There seems to be no end to the obfuscation that goes on when
military expenditures come under close scrutiny. A report issued
by the Employment Research Associates out of Lansing, Michigan
goes into considerable detail concerning an alternative security
policy, making a number of recommendations and proposals that
would result in vast savings in military and defense outlays.
Its report with the heading of "Converting the American Economy"
emphasizes that "the ending of the Cold War has given us
unparalleled opportunity to rebuild our nation." But there must
be some doubt or reservations even  by ERA that anything will be
done to phase out the extravagant and useless military and
defense expenditures. Its report includes the following
footnote:
<p>
So far the nation and the American people are still waiting for
the law to be changed where there will be a sizable reduction in
military expenditures and the savings will be used for much
needed civilian purposes.
<p>
In an article that appeared in the May 1992 issue of <em>The
Nation</em> by Robert L. Borosage under the heading, "Mugged
Again", he reveals what really goes on behind the scenes by
those in Congress who are supposed to represent the people and
the general welfare of the nation. To quote Borosage: "On March
31, 1992, the House of Representatives voted 238 to 187 against
transferring even a nickel from the military to domestic
programs." He went on to say: "On April 9, 1992, the Senate
voted to support the President's military budget,limiting any
chances for reasonable defense savings this year. The results of
the votes will be cuts in domestic programs in the midst of a
recession." One might conclude from Borosage's remarks that when
it comes to maintaining huge military expenditures, there is no
gridlock at either end of Pennsylvania Avenue.
<p>
Borosage's disclosures elaborate on why the Peace Dividend never
became a reality. He mentions that the President and Congress
were adamant to limit any new military cuts to 3 percent. And he
makes known that the White House budget--essentially endorsed by
the Senate--would include military and defense expenditures to
Europe amounting to $120 billion. This took place at a time when
the President and members of Congress had publicly stated and
admittedthat there was no military threat, exaggerated or
manufactured, to the United States.
<p>
It must be evident that the collusion (an inherent
characteristic of the present economic system) that takes place
between the politicos and the inner circle or "power elite" has
one purpose: to maintain and perpetuate the financial structure
for their own advantage or personal aggrandizement regardless of
the consequences to the nation and the American people.
<p>
If the United States can mobilize its resources and industry for
war and superfluous purposes, there is no reason why it cannot
make the transition or conversion from a war economy to a stable
and viable economy. A harmonious and functional operation of
this nation's highly interdependent social and technological
infrastructure must take precedence over everything else.
Whatever is essential and necessary for this nation's physical
requirements and well being must be given the highest possible
priority and consideration even if it means the implementation
of an alternative or new method of operating the economy.
<p>
At a time when the nation needs a new direction, the attempt to
maintain the present economic system through vast military
expenditures and massive debt creation can only accelerate the
process of disintegration. It should be understood that a strong
and viable domestic economy is the best policy for the security
of the country. The implementation of a national conversion
program where all of the resources of the nation are mobilized
for essential and meaningful purposes would be thebest remedy
for the nation's present crisis.
