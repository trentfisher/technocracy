<h3>Famous Quotations on Money</h3>
<p>
In 1700 Mayer Amschel Rothschild said: ``Permit me to issue
and control the money of a nation, and I care not who makes its
laws.''
<p>
Thomas Jefferson said: ``I believe that banking institutions
are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies.
Already they have raised up a money aristocracy that has set the
government at defiance. The issuing power(of money) should be
taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it
belongs.''
<p>
Dr. R. E. Search said:
``When the Babylonian civilization collapsed, three percent of
the people owned all the wealth. When old Persia went down to
destruction, twopercent of the people owned all the wealth. When
ancient Greece went down to ruin, one-half of one percent of the
people owned all the wealth. When the Roman Empire fell by the
wayside, two thousand people owned the wealth of the civilized
world...It is said at this time that less than two (2) percent
of the people control ninety percent of the wealth of America.''
<p>
Aristotle on Usury in 350 BC: ``Money being naturally
barren, to make it breed money is preposterous, and a perversion
from the end of its institution, which was only to serve the
purpose of exchange and not of increase...Usury is most
reasonably detested as the increase arises from the money itself
and not by employing it to the purpose for which it was
intended.''
<p>
(From <cite>Lincoln Money Martyred</cite>, by Dr. R.E. Search.)
<p>
THE BIBLE ON USURY: Leviticus: 25 C 36-37 V. ``Take thou no usury
of him, or increase; but fear thy God; that thy brother may live
with thee. Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury, nor
lend him thy victuals for increase.''
<p>
Deuteronomy: 23 C. 19 V. ``Thou shalt not lend upon usury to thy
brother, usury of money, usury of victuals, usury of any thing
that is lent upon usury.''
