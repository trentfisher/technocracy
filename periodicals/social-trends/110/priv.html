<p>
Good morning. Welcome to the Grand Canyon. It's our pleasure here
at Natural Wonders, Inc. to bring you this awe-inspiring
spectacle. How many, please? Four of you? Fine. That will be two
hundred dollars. Cash or Charge?"
<p>
"Two hundred dollars? I won't pay it! There are plenty of other
canyons around. I'll go to Bryce."
<p>
"I'm sorry sir, but Bryce is undergoing a leveraged buyout, and
they have suspended operations temporarily. We are offering a
special in November, one free admission with three adult
admissions. Plus, we includea free roll of Natural Wonders film
for your camera that can be developed at any of our hundreds of
outlets across the country. Or, may I recommend another
attraction? No charge for the recommendation."
<p>
"Isn't there any place I can see for free?"
<p>
"Oh, excuse me a moment...Security, this is Gate Three. We have
an unauthorized aircraft over Sector Twelve, trying to get a
free look. Can you intercept? Good. Thanks."
<p>
"I'm sorry for the interruption. As you can see, nothing is
free. If you want to cheap out, the best we can do is recommend
one of the less attractive attractions. Or maybe you'd prefer a
crowded one. High volume allows us to offer a better deal."
<p>
"No, let me out of here. What's the quickest way to Phoenix?"
<p>
"Well, I'm sorry you feel that way, but if you insist, we offer
Highway 16. We're running a special for a limited time only--
twenty-three cents a mile. But you'd better hurry."
<p>
"Twenty-three...why, that's highway robbery!"
<p>
"Be nice, now. Remember the signs you saw on the way up here."
<p>
"What signs?"
<p>
"We reserve the right to refuse use of this road to anyone."
<p>
If the previous scenario seems a little far-fetched, consider
the latest proposal by the Price System think-tankers,
specifically Robert Poole of the <strong>Reason</strong> (?)
<strong>Foundation of Los Angeles</strong>. His idea, for which
President Bush has paved the way by making it easier to
privatize state and local operations, calls for turning over the
overhauling of the infrastructure to private business: roads,
bridges, airports and water treatment plants. (San Francisco
Examiner, May 10, 1992)
<p>
Springboarding off the floods in Chicago due to deteriorating
underground water conduits, free enterprisers are all set to
jump into the public sector game. After all, if the government
can't keep things up and constantly operates at a loss, it just
makes good sense to turn over the entire operation to profit-
seeking entrepreneurs. (Of course, little mention is made of the
fact that the original pipelines involved were installed by
private contractors and maintained by them until the business
went belly-up.)
<p>
According to an ingenious plan worked up by Joe Kingsbury Smith,
Washington editor of the San Francisco Examiner, here's how the
game of "creating a new order of prosperityand sanity" by
turning over the public domain to private enterprise would work
(quote from Randolph Hearst, Jr.). Invite the states and local
governments to buy into the game, on a voluntary basis, of
course, (with a little nudge to their volunteer spirit in the
form of subsidies). The work force would be drawn from the ranks
of the unemployed with a no-strike provision writtenin, again on
a voluntary basis, but one that can be imposed if need be.
<p>
Get it? Who has created, and is perfectly capable of adding to
the ranks of the unemployed, but business. Lay off the work
force, then draft them back to work to rebuild and refurbish as
theirpatriotic duty--<em>but with no strikes.</em> (And let's
not forget all the displaced government workers who will be
pounding the pavement.) Forced labor at whatever wages business
deems in line with their profit margins, with the blessings of
the government.
<p>
And all it would take to enact this pleasant scheme is a sweep
of the pen of the Chief Executive Officer of the United States.
<p>
f course, the proposal is presently limited to the
infrastructure and is supposed to be for only two years'
duration. But with such and enterprise in place, how long would
it be before the entrepreneurial hounds are let loose on every
other item useful to humans that can be scarfed up and dispensed
in limited quantities, or milked or mined or harvested for all
they're worth: national parks, forests, waterways, land, sea and
sky. Such a grim forecast already exists in the oxygen stands in
Mexico City.
<p>
While we're considering the exhilarating prospect for every
phase of the social operation being carried out on a "what's in
it for me" basis, let's remember that it was government, not
business, that instituted things like child labor laws, forty-
hour work weeks, seat belts, environmental protection and food
labeling. If left to the tender ministrations of business, the
sweat shops would still be in full swing, and kids would still
be coughing up coal dust.
<p>
Who but business has bitterly and vehemently opposed, and
continues to lobby against, every measure for the welfare of the
general populace that might cut into their profits? When the
corporate arm is finally sufficiently twisted, the cost is, of
course, passed on to the consumer.
<p>
On the positive side of this, if you don't mind corporate
control of every facet of your life, there are ample
opportunities for budding free enterprisers. For example:
<p>
"Look, dear, isn't that a red-winged blackbird?"
<p>
"Yes, I believe it is."
<p>
"Excuse me, are you two looking at that bird there?"
<p>
"Why, yes, we are."
<p>
"I thought so. I represent Songbirds, Inc. We have exclusive
rights to all pay-per-views. That will be two dollars."
<p>
"Two dollars! To look at a bird?"
<p>
"Relax. That's nothing. These are a dime a dozen. If you were
watching some rare species, like a spotted owl, it could run you
fifty bucks."
<p>
Or how about this...
<p>
"Excuse me, sir. Didn't I just see you help that old woman
across the street?"
<p>
"Yes, you did."
<p>
"Well, I represent The National Brotherhood of Good Samaritans.
May I see your union card?"
<p>
"My...what?"
<p>
"Your card. You can't go around stealing work away from our
members, you know."
<p>
(Gasp of astonishment)
<p>
"Oops, that'll cost you, too. I also represent Fresh Air
International. You just stole air with that last gasp."
