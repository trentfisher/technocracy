We seem to differ on several points and agree on others.   You are
entirely correct when you say we won't be able to predict what kind of
society will be with us when a transition takes place or the exact
operating characteristics that will apply at that time.  Any attempts
to project the present system into future trends are futile.  The best
we can do is extrapolate.  This can be done much more reliably with
physical factors than with the vagaries of finance.
<p>
The money system should have turned toes up many years ago.  It is
staggering along now through massive injections of debt.  And it
probably can continue to do so for some time - until the level of
social tolerance is reached.  It is reasonably certain, however, that
to continue on our present course can only lead to economic, social,
and environmental disaster.  I believe on that point we are both
agreed.
<p>
For further information I enclose Technocracy's Technological Social
Design handbook.  It is a synopsis of a Study Course that Technocracy
has presented since the 1940s.  Any Technocrat will tell you that it
is <b>not </b>fixed in stone, that it is a set of guidelines that are
entirely amenable to conditions that exist at the time a transition is
inevitable.  I think you will see that a great many of its proposals
make more physical sense than anything that has gone before.
<p>
I have misgivings about any group of people representing a particular
segment of society having control.  That goes for &quot;the working
class&quot; as well as anyone else.  Technocracy sees the working
class as it is presently defined:  as being a virtual nonentity in the
future.  Technocracy makes no attempt to preserve it or &quot;give it
a fair shake.&quot;  We feel that the so-called &quot;work ethic&quot;
is primarily a mechanism used to coax stoop labor from the worker
during the hand-tool age, to the benefit of the ruling elite, which
gladly pounced on technology when it came along to knock out the
expense of human labor .  In this age of automated production, it is
becoming an increasingly negligible factor.  The working class has
been of value to the &quot;system&quot; only as producers and spenders
of revenue.
<p>
The <b>only </b>way we may achieve equity is by adopting a
distribution system in which <b>no one </b>may exercise power over
another's consuming privileges.  <b><i>The entire key to minimizing
abuse of power is to structure the distribution system so that no
person, group of people, economic strategy, government agency or
political edict may reduce the equal consuming privilege of any
citizen by reason of any interpretation of that
citizen's &quot;contribution&quot; to society.</i></b> This cannot be
done by whim or populist movements but only scientifically and
objectively. The primary basis for determining purchasing power now is
what?  <b><i>How much revenue a person turns over.  </i></b>This has
little to do with contribution.  How many people receive little or
nothing for valuable contributions?  We are not about to change our
economic system to allow for this, to compensate people
&quot;fairly.&quot;  The market system is anything but fair.
<p>
Yes, the concept of a &quot;continental control&quot; can have
sinister connotations.  And yes, technical people can abuse power just
as badly as any other group of people but only <b>as long as the
system allows them to do so.  </b>Scientists and engineers could carry
the same garbage of scarcity conditioning into leadership roles, thus
creating a technical elite much like the financial elite of the
present system.  The only way, therefore, is to arrange distribution
so that <b>no one </b>will have preferential advantage over someone
else so far as purchasing power is concerned. Just visualize the
freedom that would accompany the realization that no predator could
hold your purchasing power over your head for the purpose of coercion,
intimidation, or extortion.  Think of all the negative behavior that
would disappear.
<p>
Continental control may be  a misnomer.  Continental management or
coordination might be more acceptable.  When we speak of the various
facets involved in our complex society, someone has to know more than
others about the subject.  Sometimes, however, these people are not
suited to direct people.  Some of them have trouble directing
themselves under our present system. In <i>Technocracy</i> <b>people
would not be governed.  </b>The<b> machines of production would be</b>
<b>governed.</b>  The ultimate right of the people would be economic
freedom:  freedom from toil (as much as possible), and freedom to
consume within the parameters of the natural world and our ability to
convert it to our use respective of its limitations.
<p>
Social issues would most likely be dealt with through electronic
voting but <b>only </b>by a public that is informed on <b>all
</b>aspects of an issue.  Some decisions of a physical nature, of
course, could not be made on the basis of a vote.  For example,
population experts tell us that for the world to enjoy a relatively
comfortable standard of living well into the future, we need to reduce
the world population to around two billion in the next hundred years.
This could be done without wars or famines by limiting family size to
an average of 1.5 children.  How many would vote for this?  And such a
vote would never be taken in a money system, as more babies mean more
customers.
<p>
Technocracy addresses itself primarily to the physical phenomena of
human society, particularly production and distribution.  Social
measures are geared to the physical.  For example, the work week would
be distributed evenly over seven days, with each four-hour shift
staggered to distribute work evenly around the clock.  This would
reduce the load on facilities and recreational areas by spreading it
out.  For example, work force A would work from day 1 through day 4,
work force B would work from day 2 through day 5, and so on.
<p>
Goods would be produced with the emphasis on the most efficient use of
resources.  In other words, if Tire A required 50 units of energy and
delivered 25,000 miles, Tire B required 70 units and delivered 40,000
miles, and Tire C delivered 75,000 miles but took 200 units to
produce, Tire B would be the tire of choice as it delivers the most
miles per energy unit.  Energy accounting confuses a lot of people,
because we are so accustomed to thinking in terms of how many earned
dollars something costs.
<p>
I greatly fear that we will see a heightened oppression by the money
people as they see their game unraveling.  We already see it in a
million and one different ways.  Go into a department store and you
feel like a criminal.  Video cameras and monitoring devices are
everywhere.  Convenience stores in my neck of the woods have little
hash marks by the door to get a height fix on the person who
&quot;hit&quot; the store.  I supervise the locksmith department in
our local school system.  Do you know the sophisticated locks (and, of
course, increasingly expensive locks) they put on everything now?  All
because people are afraid of someone taking something away from them.
<p>
Of course, all this good talk will come to naught if we don't break
away from the <b>growth is good </b>paradigm (ably fostered and
perpetuated by the money, military, and ecclesiastical triad) that
makes any  attempt at controlling burgeoning populations an exercise
in futility.  As populations are encouraged to expand to increase
markets, more stress will be placed on resources and bionomic systems.
This in turn will impact on the social environment.  Robert Kaplan, in
<i>The Coming Anarchy </i>(Atlantic Monthly, Feb. '94 issue), presents
a picture of the future in which a few technologically advanced areas
of the world will survive in comparable luxury while the rest descend
into an irredeemable chaos of war, starvation, and abject poverty due
to dwindling resources.  How long it will be before this dissolution
has its effect in the comfy-cozy, resource-gluttonous areas is
anybody's guess.  The United States is already dependent on foreign
lands for a large proportion of its non-fuel mineral resources.
<p>
Your choice of the term &quot;good&quot; as it relates to the social
condition is a bit disturbing, as it is a relative term.  What was
&quot;good&quot; for pumping up pseudo-patriotism in the form of the
Gulf War definitely spoiled the day for over a hundred thousand Iraqis
(and a few Americans to boot).
<p>
Another term we try to avoid is &quot;ownership.&quot;  I realize the
connotation both you and I attach to it - a common access and
stewardship.  To the Technocrats, however, the concept of ownership is
a backlash to scarcity conditions, and it plays no part in our
vocabulary as it denotes exclusiveness.
<p>
I have little faith in the &quot;voice of the people&quot; unless that
voice comes from an <b>objectively informed</b> people to whom
<b>every </b>side of an issue has been presented.  This is of course
impossible in our present special-interest system.
<p>
Yes, I believe the people are quite capable of understanding their
needs - if presented with the right frame of reference.  This too is
an immensely complex subject in a technological society.  What are
needs?  What are wants?  How many people &quot;needed&quot; a car 100
years ago?  How many &quot;needed&quot; a PC 20 years ago?  How many
need a cellular phone now?  Why, all of a sudden, is a copy machine an
indispensable item?  How much of this stuff would we need if we didn't
have all the wheel-spinning activities involved with the legalistic
and property-oriented trappings of the money system, and if we weren't
constrained to work our fool heads off to pay the debt mongers?
<p>
Do we need neon lights under our cars, or a hundred different styles
of razors, or one kind of shampoo to add goop to our hair and another
to wash it out?  How much of this stuff has been &quot;sold&quot; to
us?
<p>
Do we need to be enslaved to individual automobiles to feel like a
&quot;free&quot; society?  How much of this is spectacle of the
beautiful blonde in the convertible, trundling her curves around an
equally curvaceous mountain highway?
<p>
Our needs and our perception of them must be synched with the physical
factors that determine the ability to meet these needs.  We need 2500
calories per day, give or take a couple of hundred, to remain healthy.
How many take in twice this amount (mostly because they feel lousy
about themselves, thanks to the money system that demands that we
never feel as if we've had enough), and how many take in a bare
subsistence level?  How many choose good, nutritious food, and how
many glut themselves on junk food produced merely for the sale?
<p>
In short, <b>advertising </b>in any form has to go.  Information on
new products and developments, fine.  Information to peddle goods to
an insatiable, bored and brainwashed public, no.  Unfortunately, in a
money system, <b>all</b> information, whether on a new drug or a
political candidate, is designed to sell something, to feed someone's
little wad of preferential advantage somewhere along the line.
<p>
Some of our views and aims are parallel.  However, Technocracy cannot
align itself with any established political movement.  It must be
presented as an entirely new concept, devoid of any connection with
any other movement that has been tried.
<p>
It's good to hear that you have observed more people questioning the
sanctity of the &quot;system.&quot;  But where do they go?  <b>We need
a movement to do away with money before it destroys us.  </b>
<p>
I hope to hear from you again soon.  In addition to our handbook, I
have enclosed some other material reflective of our direction,
including our current newsletter.
