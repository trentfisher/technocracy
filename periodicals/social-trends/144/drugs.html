Globe.  Permission to reprint to the Internet has not been obtained,

<h4>REMOVE THE PROFIT</h4>
<p>
Mr. Nyhan makes an interesting point, one that has been bandied around for
several years.  Remove the profit from illegal drugs, and the problem will
disappear practically overnight.  Gone would be the pushers.  Gone would be the
reason for their existence. Without the pushers, there would be fewer drug
addicts.
<p>
The drug criminals have traded one narcotic for another--illegal booze for
illegal drugs.  Prohibition of alcohol in the early part of this century
created a lively bunch of gangsters who would just as soon blow your head off
as look at you.  And prohibition did not stop people from drinking alcoholic
beverages.  Say "no" and the product becomes that much more intriguing.
People were drinking rotgut booze, wood alcohol included, which caused some
imbibers to go blind.  Others had stills set up in their bathtubs.  Hidden back
rooms in business establishments kept people supplied with liquor at a hefty
price, which they were willing to pay.  Prohibition probably did more to
encourage people to get started drinking than any other factor.  There were
plenty of "pushers" of booze around to drum up business.
<p>
When Franklin Delano Roosevelt repealed the prohibition statute, the
downsized booze criminals merely found another illegal product to make billions
off of:  drugs.  And these druglords would just as soon blow your head off as
look at you.
<p>
So why doesn't our government consult its own history to find the solution
to the drug war?  Could it be that our government is involved in the drug
trade?  That all these drug busts are only a smoke screen to help convince
citizens that something positive is being done to curb the drug trade?   And
are drug busts with their  subsequent prison terms just one more way to control
the masses?
<p>
In 1981 Mayor Ferre of Miami, Florida, said: <p>
``Miami is the only place in the United States that's going to escape major
recessions, and the reason -- you really have to be honest about it -- goes
back to two things:  the drug cash flow that comes in and impacts the whole
community.  And number two, the increased centralization of trade, commerce,
and banking in Miami toward the Caribbean and Central and South America.''  At
that time, drug-smuggling was South Florida's number one industry, even above
tourism, and undoubtedly it still is.
<p>
If this idea of legalizing drugs would curb drug crimes, wouldn't removing
the profit from everything else have the same effect on all other crimes,
except those of passion?  With machines taking over jobs, crime can only
increase if displaced people aren't given some kind of security for themselves
and their families.Who will purchase the abundance our technology can produce
as the job market continues to decline?  Who will pay the politicians their fat
salaries when people are out of work and government tax income dries up?
<p>
It seems clear that our social problems are not political but
technological.  It seems clear that technological problems cannot be solved by
lawyers, bankers and merchant chiefs, the professions that generate most of our
politicians.
<p>
Our present economic system needs revision.  For a new idea that has been
around for over 60 years, examine Technocracy's concepts on Energy Accounting.
Remove profit, eliminate crime. Can it be done?  It doesn't cost anything to
investigate a new idea.
