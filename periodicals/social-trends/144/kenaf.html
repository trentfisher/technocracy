Flax and kenaf can be made into paper and wood products with the same
machines used to make tree products.  Agricultural farm crop wastes can
supplement declining timber harvests for paper.
<h4>Soil Erosion Control:  </h4>
<p>
Mud slides, caused by clear-cuts, have increased tremendously in Oregon.
Every year we lose precious top soil.  We can plant flax and kenaf to protect
watersheds from erosion.  Both plants have powerful tap roots that hold the
soil together better than native grasses.  In fact, the Forest Service used
flax and other plants for erosion control in California and Oregon until the
early 1900s.
<p>
<h4>Environmentally Benign:</h4>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Plants make 4 times as much pulp per acre as 30-year-old
      trees.  Over a 30 year period, plant crops could produce 120 to
      160 times as much paper. Plant paper can be processed without
      harmful chemicals like chlorine bleach.
  <li>Kenaf and flax pulp can be recycled 4-5 times as much as tree
      pulp.<p>
  <li>Can be added to wood pulp to increase strength, therefore
      saving trees.<p>
  <li>Can be grown without pesticides, herbicides or fertilizers.
      Drought resistant and pest resistant.
  <li>Add plants to wood by-products to increase strength.
</ul>
<p>
<h4>Consumers Drive the Market:</h4>
<p>
You have the power to choose tree-free paper products.  You can demand
paper products made with plants.  Recycled paper products that  are labeled
100% recycled might have as little as 10% recycled material. In reality, post
consumer product determines the exact amount of recycled material.  If it says
100% recycled, it legally can contain 90% virgin trees.
<p>
<h4>Supplement, Not Replacement:</h4>
<p>
Adding flax and kenaf to tree-pulp increases strength and recyclability and
decreases chemicals and clear-cuts.  The increased supply would save the mills
from closing and re-open closed mills.  In the early 1900s, Oregon was the top
producer of flax in the United States.
<p>
<h4>Saving Trees Saves Jobs!</h4>
<p>
Annually renewable plants would supplement declining timber
harvests used by the paper and particle board industries.  Jobs would be saved
in the mills and on the farms.  Flax and kenaf can be used in the local mills
without retooling.  Crops can be harvested by farmers every year, which would
save the small family farm from urban development.  Oregon flax was worth more
than the land it was grown on, and it rivaled timber in economic revenues.  We
can't afford to lose millions to flax imports.
<p>
<h4>Make Paper With Plants!</h4>
<p>
Making plant products can be done at home, and you don't need a
mill to make fiberboard or paper.  You need:  1 household blender; 1 grill
(barbecue); 1 window screen; three blocks of wood.  First chop your stalks, add
water and blend into pulp.  Then pour through screen to catch fibers.  Fold
screen to sandwich pulp and squeeze as much water out as possible.  Put a sheet
of newspaper on both sides and trim edges.  Place "new" sandwich on grill on
stove.  Add blocks and large book for weight.  Flip sandwich every 5-10 minutes
to dry evenly.  Remove newspapers when dry enough to hold form.  Cut into
samples, show them.(Information put out by TEST -- <i>Try Environmental
Solutions Together</i>, Cave Junction, Oregon.)
