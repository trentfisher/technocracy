<p>
More than misuse of technology is involved in the psychozoic era
arisen from the
rubble of millennia of thought control.  For thousands of years of recorded
history, nations and empires in their unenlightenment accepted governance based
upon an enigma (an ancient obscure perplexing statement, a "parable") whose
origin legend dates to genesis and the birth of ignorance and discord.<p>
It describes the autocratic rule of a kingdom by a self-proclaimed omnipotent
power whose dictum is of a mental status quo that challenges all attempts at
the establishment of an Age of Reason.  But its destruction of the powers of
creative intellects on the plain of Shinar, Mesopotamia, and their tower and
city, was an arbitrary violation of the evolutionary laws governing the
Universe and the origin of species.
<p>
Today the essential predicament of Man in general is that he is aware of his
infinitesimal presence in the cosmos that presents a challenge not only to his
overwhelming unjustified ego but to the inherited conditioned ignorance of his
ancestral past to which he has given unquestioning fealty and obeisance to
authoritarianism.
<p>
In an ever expanding cosmic evolution of a Universe containing billions of
galaxies whose distances are measured in light-years, our nation since its
inception and the Western World exist in an intellectual vacuum that began with
the Decree that was pronounced against Copernicus on March 5, 1616 A.D. and the
burning at the stake of Giordano Bruno, February 17, 1600 A.D. for having dared
to envision the magnificence of the universe, thereby challenging the command
of the obscurants and their claim to authority and infallibility.
<p>
On March 2, 1972, Pioneer 10 left Earth to travel beyond the Solar System with
a message toward the stars.  If its intent came to fruition, the discovery of
new life would be epochal, confounding the world's philosophies, theologians,
the U. S. Supreme Court, and other self-proclaimed authorities.
<p>
Should such aliens of Space be of a higher order of intelligence and awareness,
what would be their response to a people whose governance is founded upon
intellectual stagnation and suppression; human beings who have been engaged in
their own extinction?  And--of a world where arrogance and greed dominate and
ignorance and poverty afflict the many?
<p>
In 1989 a satellite called the Cosmic Background Explorer, or COBE, was
launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base.  On April 23, 1992 its findings were
reported to scientists attending a meeting of the American Physical Society in
Washington, D.C. and was greeted with great excitement.  The evidence gathered
by the satellite and heavily processed by computer, according to analysis then
being discussed, was of our universe when it was young, rapidly growing and
held no galaxies at all.  It contained only expanding clouds of atomic
hydrogen, helium and a few trace elements and was of intense
radiation.
<p>
The satellite detected a whisper of radiation dating from the Big Bang, which
astronomers estimated as to having occurred approximately 15 billion years ago.
The original temperature of the radiation is estimated to have been 7,200
degrees Fahrenheit.  Over time, as the universe expanded, the average
temperature of the radiation is now about 2.73 degrees above absolute zero--or
around minus 454.8 degrees Fahrenheit.
<p>
The birth of the universe was calculated to one ten thousand  billion
quadrillion quadrillionth of a second.  (A decimal point followed by 42 zeros
and a one), of 1 second.
<p>
The original radiation is considered to be the afterglow of the Big Bang.
Imprints of the afterstructure that shaped our newborn universe an instant
after creation were detected and identified as "ripples in space and time."
The first thousandth of a second included an incredible "inflation" before
medium physical forces such as gravity and electromagnetism became distinct.
Space consisted of subatomic particles immersed in radiation.  Most of the
matter is in a "dark matter" form that defies direct detection, but its gravity
gradually dominates the structural evolution of the universe.<p>
In the time period of 300,000 years to about a billion years following the
evolution of the universe, the first galaxies formed and gases became dense
enough to collapse into stars.
<p>
In 1991 the Vatican approved a <u>Dial-a-Pope 900 service number.</u>
(900-568-7733), called "Christian Messaging From the Vatican" with the Vatican
receiving 50 percent of the charge for each call to the service.
<p>
In 1993 the Israeli phone company opened a new fax line to God, (972-2-235-555)
which will receive messages that are copied and sent by messenger to the
crannies of Jerusalem's Wailing Wall.  These calls also are not toll
free.
<p>
So has the irrational use of technology had its effect upon the world of
hundreds of millions of believers.
<p>
In the New World, in the 18th century, A.D., Citizen Thomas Paine, Technologist
and author of <i>Common Sense, The Crisis, The Rights of Man </i>and <i>The Age
of Reason </i>was accused of heresy, subjected to slanderous abuse, and
persecuted even to the grave.
<p>
To have reduced the importance of that first thousandth of a second recording
the birth of the universe, and the billions of years of cosmic evolution, to
the origin of terrestrial species HOMO and ecocide and genocide, and arrogance
and ignorance, engenders the cynical question, "Is the human being a desired
specie of life?"
<p>
It is revealing to what contemptible matters that dominant despotic obscurants
give their attention.  The restoration of Michelangelo's <i>The Last Judgment
</i>in the Sistine Chapel reveals religion as "a monument in the history of
human 'ignorance and egotism'", and its "morality as its fundamental  myth."
During its painting Michelangelo was censored for having portrayed too
literally Creation's original Images, a viewpoint expressed by pontiffs over
the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, and upon whose instructions the Renaissance
masterpiece painting was modified by 38 modesty breeches, ranging from fig
leaves to girdles similar to jockstraps.
<p>
Before submitting the restoration to public view in 1994, consideration was to
be given as to what modesty modifications were to be removed in restoring
Michelangelo's original imagery concept.
<p>
So  is a mockery made of man's pretentious claim to an image of
excellence.
<p>
Upon entering the 21st century the inhabitants of our nation whose arrogant
egotism claims an ascendancy to an image of shared power now reveal the extent
of the intellectual vacuum in which they exist, as by the millions they seek
their "roots."  As presently constituted the United States is a decaying
reactionary citadel that has spawned Indoctrinated, hyphenated Americans who
choose even in death and burial to be segregated by creed, nationality and
race.  In 1980 there  were approximately 15 million foreign-born persons in the
United States of whom 49.5 percent held non-citizen status.
<p>
The cultural flux of the United States as reported in 1988 by the Census Bureau
indicated that populations of ethnic and racial minorities in the United States
will grow seven times faster than that of the non-hispanic white majority over
this decade due to immigration and high birth rates.
<p>
The aforementioned immigrants represent centuries of static social history and
the pervasive aftermath of authoritarian indoctrination and dictatorial rule,
from the days of conquistadors, Torquemada and a Franco, to the present, and of
Asiatic despotism from Tamerlane to Pol Pot; (these are the  roots of the
past).  They comprise one of the major factors entering into the decision
making process involving the creation upon this North American Continent of an
Age of Reason and a Civilization based upon scientific principles and
technology.
<p>
Although even ancient societies have used mathematics and measurement for the
solution of purely practical problems, they, even as we, had not learned to
think in terms of abstract principles.  They had little desire to inquire into
the "how" and the "why" of the working of nature with the result that their
highly developed engineering and technology bore little relation to their
philosophies of life and as a result eventually their civilizations ceased to
exist.
<p>
The future of this North American Continent, as with other continents of the
world, is linked irrevocably to the unwritten natural laws that govern all life
and the universe.  What is euphemistically referred to as American liberty is
as answerable to the violation of these laws in its thoughtless advocacy of
exponential growth that has brought the problems arising from the ravenous
demands made upon its finite resources by an unlimited population growth and
its system of predatory exploitation.
<p>
The United States already has become a  "have-not" nation through the arrogant
and ignorant exploitation of its natural resources, creating a situation
fraught with problems of great dimensions that require the abolishment of war,
a transition to new energy resources, the stabilization of populations, and a
<u>scientific governance of functions</u> through which Man will live in
harmony with his environment.
<p>
At the present time we have left that governance to the inept, the incompetent
and the corrupt.  As historical records reveal, corruptions at the top levels
of government, such as are now being investigated in Washington D.C., have
permeated our government since its formation.  A reflection of America's
hypocritical rectitude and perpetuated ignorance
<p>
As we turn the pages of history, according to Lucretius, Roman poet and
philosopher, 96(?)--  05 B.C., the evolution of humankind is marked by three
periods of time distinguished by the materials employed in the making of
implements: the Age of stone, the Age of bronze, and the Age of iron, which
identified man as the maker and user of tools.
<p>
Two thousand years later, after the revolution in physics, and twelve
generations after Galileo, in 1967, another astronomer in his comments upon
cosmic evolution observed "that the discovery of the expanding universe
indicates that growth, change, evolution, affect also the future of the galaxy
of galaxies."
<p>
Cosmic evolution naturally takes care of such matters as the origin of life.
The progression is clear and rational through the whole course--atoms to stars
to cells to man. In this progression civilized protoplasmic man has not
ventured far from his cenozoic primitive root in respect that he is at the
wild, animal level: food, fight, shelter, procreation.  Little need had he for
ruminations concerning the meaning of life.  But the eventual emergence of
societies among the primates made meditation advisable--made it necessary for
long-term survival.
<p>
In 1987 upon this North American Continent, a papal pronouncement was given to
university students calling for a new crusade, whose adherents were to engage
with a renewed vigor their ancient ideological assault upon science in the
countries of their domicile, stating, "A metaphysical approach is needed as an
antidote to intellectual and moral relativism," emphasizing that the purpose of
the university was to act "in its privileged roll as protagonist in the
encounter between faith and science."
<p>
Belief is violence done to the intellect.  The extent that we submit to it
reflects the degree of acceptance of the dictates of authoritarianism and a
refutation of all pretense of evolutionary self development.  The destiny of
Western Man is and over the centuries has been calculatedly determined and
controlled by the petrified tablets of Antiquities dogmatism that call for an
acknowledgment  of unquestioning obedience and submission to authority.  It
legislates that "man may turn over and explore a million objects but must not
discover the universe," <u>or the love of reason</u> that gives us an insight
of all things great and small.
<p>
The enlarged frontal lobes of terrestrial species HOMO have brought forth a
mental complex holding the choice of positive or negative concepts of
performances of altruism, and mutual respect, and also greed, mendacity,
distrust and the insanity of ecocide and genocide.  This forebrain of the most
specialized primates has so complicated man's life that precise programs for
living are essential.  The program planning requires a philosophy of living and
of life described as an assembly of ideals, programs for life that identify
this period of time as the beginning of the psychozoic era.
<p>
<h4><a name="part2">December, 1938</a></h4>
<p>
In an article entitled <i>Science and Society</i>, Technocracy stated that
North America's rendezvous with destiny prescribes that a minority of
scientists "be the nucleus around which this Continent will consolidate its
forces for its integration into one geographical entity--one Continental
control, one technological organism, one country, one people, one and
indivisible," and the language of unification that gave birth to our nation and
identify its principles of governance.
<p>
The rate of growth of scientific knowledge has accelerated to a point whereby
the distance between intellectual wisdom and indoctrinated belief and ignorance
has assumed the dimensions of the "red shift" of the galaxies.  <u>The
continuity from generation to generation has been lost almost completely</u>.
Education should be, at least in some respects, <i>the expression of man's
highest faculty, the free play of the intellect</i>, his ethos and e'lan vital.
The latter is a projection of Technocracy's research, analysis and design.  We
must again seek the shimmering spark of enlightenment.
<p>
There is a new population in our schools as identified in a report released
<u>January 22, 1988</u>.  The cultures, backgrounds and languages entering
California schools are vastly different than they were in the prior decade.
The State superintendent of instruction referred to it as "a huge
demographic change."  It was
estimated that one out of every six school children is an immigrant, nearly 17
percent of the state's 4.5 million students--2 1/2 times
<p>
what it was 10 years previous, and would increase 5 to 7 percent a year during
the next decade (1990s);  613,222 were of limited English proficiency; their
language breakdown was 73.3% Spanish, 9.1% Southeast Asian, 7.5% Asian, 2.3%
Tagalog/Filipino and 5.8% "other."  San Francisco and Imperial Counties have
the greatest concentration of these students according to the report.
<p>
<u>April 29, 1994</u>.  The San Francisco Board of Education, this fall
semester under the Immersion Program, will emphasize teaching in primary
languages in the public schools.  Also, it can be implemented upon request.  As
an example, about 50 Korean parents asked the school district to provide the
immersion program so that their children could become familiar with the
language and customs of their native land.
<p>
Immersion programs already exist in Chinese, Spanish, and Russian.  The school
district also is considering developing bilingual programs in
Vietnamese and Cambodian.
<p>
The immersion program is divisive and destructive in nature, enlarging upon
existing discord and disintegration that threaten the principle of unity
implied in the forming of  the "United States of America" as first expressed
officially on July 4, 1776, in the Declaration of Independence and that
underlies our culture and civilization.
<p>
Two thousand years of propaganda have wrought their havoc upon the Earth and
the human mind and body, and only the mute statistics protest.  Two thousand
years that have denied man his identity.  America has erected a predatory
macrostructure of special privilege that has robbed the majority of its
citizens of self autonomy.  It is a society far removed from the ancestral
pastoral environment.  Man has become alienated not only from the fruits of his
labor, but also from the roots of his biology and sense of cooperative kinship
in the family of man, and thereby has been infected by and made less resistant
to the social syphilis of greed.  Man in his final exploitation of his own
species and the environment is now engaged in the final "kill"--global
destruction.  It has been cynically referred to as placing "the people of the
world behind the barbed wire of the Global Plantation."  A world
fascism.
<p>
The future must be persistently explored.  We must proceed along the
evolutionary pathway of the Universe as co-creators on the way to the
establishment of a psychozoic haven upon this Continent, in which brain
overshadows brawn, rationality overshadows ignorance and superstition, and
science and technology eradicate the social syphilis of greed.  It is uncannily
prescient for us to remember that science provides the power to release the
Mind of man from its Babel, to achieve the long sought unlimited creative
potentialities, including the creation of cities and nations, but above all, a
new culture that will transcend the crude motivations of hunger and money; it
will set man's mind free for the true destiny of spirit,<i> the celebration of
life itself.</i>
<p>
Ignorance and arrogance as herein discussed are the factors not only governing
thought control but also our survival as an evolutionary species.
<p>
America can no longer be occupied by a high energy, highly complex
technological civilization on a haphazard, planless basis, nor under
governmental direction by the functionally illiterate.  We must plan for
survival!
<p>
The landed estate of the American people is the resource base on which the
American economy functions, and our survival and future welfare depend upon the
thought we give to its best use and how we can achieve it.
<p>
The story of our nation in the last century as regards the use of forests,
grasslands, wildlife and water sources is the most violent and the most
destructive of any written in the long history of civilization.
<p>
The total area of land available to provide the basic essentials of
life--food, fiber and shelter, is limited.  The land area of the United States
(excluding Alaska and District of Columbia) amounts to approximately one
billion nine hundred million acres (1,937,72 6,000), which includes 107.9
million acres of water areas.  In its original or natural state about 40% was
primeval forest, nearly an equal amount was grass or range lands, the remainder
being natural desert or extremely mountainous.  By the year 1948 it was
estimated that the primeval or virgin forest had been so reduced that it
covered less than 7% of our entire land area.
<p>
Dr. Hugh H. Bennett, Chief, U.S. Soil Conservation Service, testifying before
a Congressional committee in 1939 said, "In the short life of this country we
have essentially destroyed 282 million acres of crop and range land.  Erosion
is destructively active on 775 million additional acres.  About 100 million
acres of cropland, much of it representing the best cropland we have, is
finished.  We cannot restore it."  In the late 1970s American farmers were
losing nearly as much topsoil as they had during the Dust Bowl years of the
1930s.
<p>
American nutritionists have calculated that 2.5 acres per capita are required
for a minimum adequate diet.
<p>
In 1985 there were 256 million acres of cropland harvested for domestic use or
1.07 acres per capita.  The estimated total population was 239,283,000,
including the Armed Forces overseas.  On January 1, 1988, the population was
244.4 million.  The U.S. Census Bureau projections for the year 2020 is U.S.
325 million; California 48 million.  This data--the relationship of man to his
physical environment and a knowledge of the carrying capacity of the land, is
vital not only to our survival but demands our acceptance of the responsibility
of stewardship.
<p>
Even as the carrying capacity of the land is the governing factor determining
the continuance of biologic life, so are finite mineral resources and available
extraneous energy the life blood of our technological civilization.
<p>
In 1980 <i>The National Academy of Sciences </i>published a report entitled
<i>Energy In Transition 1985-2010</i> as prepared by the <i>National Resources
Council</i>.  It stressed the need for a transition from a major dependence on
fossil fuel hydrocarbons, domestic and imported, to a more stable era of
utilization of energy sources that are either renewable or available on a scale
sufficient for centuries.'
<p>
Oil production in the United States peaked in 1970.  Domestic natural gas
production in 1973.  As of 1985 the total proven oil reserves were only enough
to supply U.S. needs for less than 8 years, (until 1993).  The United States
has been a net importer of energy since the early 1950s.  The Transition Report
recorded as of 1975 that the U.S. consumed more than a fourth of the world's
oil production and about half the world's production of natural gas.   In 1987
the U.S. imported $40 billion worth of oil, at the time an amount equal to
one-third of the country's trade deficit.  During the same year, the Pentagon
spent $15 billion to protect our supplies.
<p>
On January 24, 1990, it was reported that a federal task force led by the
Commerce Department was endorsing a proposal to allow independent oil producers
to export California crude oil to Japan and other Pacific Rim nations.  The
task Force also included representatives of the U.S. Departments of Energy,
Interior, Transportation and Treasury.
<p>
Identification of the source of imported oil, natural gas and minerals will
bring a clarity to our expanding political/military ventures such as are now
taking place on the continent of Africa.
<p>
Petroleum geologists have found substantial reserves of natural gas in some 50
developing countries, with many others holding high promise.  Many of these
nations have treated gas as a waste byproduct of petroleum production and
burned it off without capturing any useful energy.  The 21 billion cubic meters
of gas Nigeria flared in 1990 represented enough energy to meet all the
country's current commercial energy needs, along with those of neighboring
Benin, Cameroon, Ghana, Niger and Togo.  But oil exporters are not the only
ones who waste natural gas.  India burned off more than 5 billion cubic meters
of natural gas in 1990, enough energy to save the country nearly $700 million
on oil import bills.
<p>
When oil companies operating in developing countries find natural gas for
which export markets are poorly developed, they cap the exploratory wells.  To
the oil exporters, a commercial-scale find of natural gas needs to be 100 times
larger than a find that could be considered cost-effective for local
use.
<p>
In 1980 it was estimated that at least 7 trillion cubic feet of natural gas
are deliberately burned off in oil fields around the world every year.
<p>
In addition to oil, so-called "strategic minerals" are seen as another
dangerous U.S. raw material dependency.  It was reported that in 1980, the
House Subcommittee on Mines and Mining found that, "No issue facing America in
the decades ahead poses the risks and dangers to the national <p>
economy and defense as that  presented by this Nation's dependence on foreign
sources for strategic and critical minerals, which reveal a vulnerability more
serious than the energy crisis."
<p>
Every American uses 18,000 pounds of non-fuel minerals (other than coal and
oil) each year.  Of the 88 minerals the Bureau of Mines regularly tracks, the
U.S. imports over half of its needs for 34 minerals.
<p>
A major goal of U.S. diplomacy in South Africa is to maintain access to
supplies of highly critical strategic materials.  Any loss of these materials
would be extremely serious for us.  South Africa has 85% of the world's known
chromium, 70% of its manganese, 80% of its platinum group metals, 47% of its
vanadium, and 55% of its gold.
<p>
Primitive Kinship societies did not have the concept of ownership and of
acquiring wealth.  Historically, the accumulation of wealth is linked to the
development of hierarchical societies and an elitism with the power to rule,
dictate policy and enforce social control.
<p>
The world that has herein been described is a world divided economically and
ideologically by a political, mercantile, military hierarchy whose outlaws of
arrogance and greed have plundered the Earth and put our technological society
at risk as the previous data reveals.  Human behavior is intimately related to
the availability of basic resources.  When a shortage of resources threatens
life styles or life itself, rivalry for resources leads to aggression and
ultimately to war.
<p>
Warfare is not a product of the human biology of aggression;  it is a product
of human culture.  War, and malign technology, are social inventions born of
arrogance, of the ethics of dominance and competition, of denial of gentle
values and separation from nature in the Nuclear Age.  <b>This sickness is
extreme.  </b>"Unfettered" technology rules and may destroy us, not through
historical necessity, but through failure to control it, to make it serve and
honour the ecological imperative of civilization.
<p>
Civilization connotes social organization of a high order, marked by
humaneness and accompanied by advances in the arts and sciences.  In 1918-19
the collective, cooperative mind that is Technocracy gave birth to a most
fruitful promise that would put an end to the exploitation of humanity and its
environment upon this Continent and surpasses the Agricultural, Industrial and
Electronic Revolutions in creative purpose and fulfillment.
<p>
The forethought of Technocracy, under the guiding direction of Howard Scott
and the research of the Technical Alliance, has taken science out of the
laboratory to plan for a new social order beyond anything the world has yet
known.  With knowledge and dedication, under its auspices there is hardly a
limit to what the human race may creatively achieve!
<p>
It is a new system of governance, a Technate, a government of functions, as
the next peaceful evolutionary step in America's destiny.  It is the total
scientific coordination of all the physical functions essential to the needs
and survival of human kind and necessary for the development of a civilization
worthy of the intelligence of Man on this North American Continent.  It's
essence is energy, the life force, and its administration is the control of the
physical factors of a social area for functional purposes, not the control of
people.  These functions are designed not only to fulfill human needs but <u>to
be in harmony with the ecological environment of its biotic
potential.</u>
<p>
Each functional sequence of operation of the Technate represents the greatest
knowledge applicable to its purpose, arrived at through interdisciplinary
research, with the cumulative gathering enriching the totality of each citizen
and assuring the continuance of the evolutionary process of society.
<p>
The criterion of performance would determine the qualifications of those
citizens operating within the organizational  structure of government.  Each
person would fulfill her/his responsibility as a citizen on the basis of their
selective determination, knowledge, competence, personal growth and mutual
cooperation.  Based upon knowledge and ability, the positions of function rise
up through the ranks of all the subdivisions in each sequence of the system to
culminate in a general staff of operations headed by a chief executive of the
entire social system identified as the Continental Director.
<p>
Inasmuch as the only common denominator of all goods and services is energy, a
Continental management of all flow lines of production and distribution would
be put into operation, providing the only exact measure of production costs,
that of energy units, and <u>the means of equitable distribution</u>.
<p>
Operating under a balanced load system of production and distribution,
commensurate with, and having a concern for nonrenewable resources and ecology,
this scientific operation would free every man, woman and child from economic
dependence upon another and would provide full consuming privileges for a
lifetime.  The work ethic, born in an age of scarcity, would have been replaced
by the right to live with dignity, making possible the self-realization of
humankind.  There would be neither taxes nor debt, slaves nor masters, poor nor
rich, despised nor exalted, for all would be known simply as Citizens of the
Technate of North America!
