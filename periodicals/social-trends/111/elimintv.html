<p>
For 15 years Jerry Mander worked in public relations as an
advertising executive.  He led the good life, keeping company
with prominent people in high-class places, traveling to foreign
countries, making money, everything he had ever hoped for.
<p>
And then events began to change his way of thinking.  During the
turbulent 60s he noticed that the news media played up protest
demonstrations as violent, ignoring the concerns of the
protesters.  These concerned citizens had to use extreme
exposure to be heard at all and then their story, often
distorted on TV, rated the back pages of the newspapers while
those who had money, many he had dealt with in his line of work,
could buy media exposure to their heart's content and use it to
advertise to make more money.
<p>
The glut of information the media can produce dulls our senses,
says Mander.  Although 80 million people can be watching
television at the same time, and 30 million can be watching the
same program, there is no way these people can know what it is
like to walk through a forest and watch nature at work; see wild
creatures foraging for food; or experience cold, clear streams
moving to some destination, nurturing the earth, fish and
wildlife on their way by watching someone else's experience on
television.  Television's invasion of the mind alters people's
behavior.  They continually take in images of whatever the media
puts out, so eventually they lose the will to use their own
imagination to be creative  themselves.
<p>
Although much of what is said above is true, and although there
is nothing like experience to realize an adventure's full
potential, the author at times speaks in generalities.  There
are millions of people whose only contact with the workings of
the environment is through television:  the handicapped, those
trapped in cities by poverty, etc.  As a brief educational
experience outside the real thing, television is difficult to
beat.
<p>
Mander sees human beings as no longer trusting their own
perception or observations unless these are proven by science
and technological factions.  He sees many children coming to
believe that everything is manufactured, even mountains.  And
children aren't the only ones who are so attuned to the
homogenized world they live in that they don't know the
difference between the taste of orange juice made from fresh
oranges or that made from juice concentrate.
<p>
He seems to be anti-technology, everything, even cars.  They
entrap us.  We drive for hundreds of miles, staring at asphalt,
not seeing the beauty of the land, trees, sky, wild flowers or
rivers because we have to watch the road.  High speeds
obliterate our perception.
<p>
Offices are technologically designed to keep employees
concentrating on their paperwork:  "...spaces are square, flat
and small, eliminating a sense of height, depth and
irregularity.  The decor is rigidly controlled to a bland
uniformity from room to room and floor to floor.  The effect is
to dampen all interest in the space one inhabits.  Most offices
have hermetically sealed windows, processed air, regulated
temperature...always the same.  Muzak homogenizes the sound
environment.  Some buildings even use 'white noise', a
deliberate mix of electronic sounds that merge into a hum.
Seemingly innocuous, it fills the ears with an even background
tone, obscuring random noises or passing conversations that
might arouse interest or create a diversion."
<p>
But aren't we seeing the misuse of technology here where extreme
work efficiency relates to the bottom line?  Of course the above
description is not a healthy environment, but since when, except
in rare cases, have businesses put the comfort of their
employees over the comfortable margin of their bank accounts?
<p>
Mander continues his accusations against technology:  "If you
accept nuclear power plants, you also accept a techno-
scientific-industrial-military elite.  The common people could
not put together a nuclear power plant.  Nor could they handle
or store the radioactive waste products that remain dangerous to
life for thousands of years.  The wastes, in turn, determine
that future societies will have to maintain a technological
capacity to deal with the problem, and the military capability
to protect the wastes.  So the existence of the technology
determines many aspects of the society."
<p>
Mander comments on mass production.  If we accept it, we accept
that a small number of people will control a large number of
people.  We accept the fact that this large number of people
will spend long, tedious hours at repetitive work, losing all
desire for a life outside of this work.  "The workers' behavior
becomes subject to the machine."  We also accept that mass
production means getting a lot of the same items to a lot of
people through advertising.
<p>
Mander ponders the mysterious insight of the early Indians who
centuries ago successfully used herbs and roots as natural cures
for disease, and he marvels that they discovered these cures
without "grants from the National Science Foundation."  And 7000
years ago the Egyptians discovered the beneficial effect of
sunlight and herbs on jaundice without a scientific grant.  How
come?
<p>
He further accuses scientists and technologists of usurping this
valuable knowledge and harvesting the medicinal resources for
their own profit, forcing the Indians who discovered the cures
to buy them back.
<p>
Most of what the author points out is only too true, but we can
hardly blame scientists and technologists for his sad state of
affairs.  Scientists are merely servants to business cartels,
including the military, that confiscate their discoveries and
use them for their own evil purposes.  War, for instance.  And
scientists like to eat and have a roof over their head, too.
But we can and should concentrate on a system that by its nature
spawns these discrepancies in its attempts to operate by ancient
rules that should have gone out with the last century, an
important point that Mander seems to have overlooked.
<p>
The author realizes that we can't get rid of all technology.
But he claims that we are entrapped by it, that because of it
we've had to conform, to change our ways in order to live in a
technological environment: we must compete; we must change our
personality, our attitude, become as handsome or as beautiful as
possible in order to progress; we must become business savvy in
a capitalist society, even rob the environment to pave our own
way to success...And many people cannot conform to all this
technology.  They drop out, take to the streets, shoot each
other, abuse their children, succumb to addictive substances...
<p>
But these people would have no trouble conforming to this
technology if it were used to solve our distribution problems.
Advertising commodities for the big sell is just about the most
inequitable and inane way to get them distributed, except for
the big bucks gang.  As Mander points out, advertising does
assist our acceptance of unnecessary technology.  He uses the
electric carving knife as an example.  We didn't know we needed
one until strong advertisements convinced us that we couldn't
get along without it.
<p>
And, of course, we can't advertise without some form of
technology.  Advertisements strive--and succeed--to create a
perpetual "need".  Evidently we are sheep that must be led by
our leader--technology.  No longer can we think for ourselves,
and our greatest leader is television.  It, alone, can
infiltrate millions of minds at the same time.  Orwell's big
brother has arrived.
<p>
This book is quite an education.  It is not just about the
adverse effects of technology and eliminating television.  It is
about many things that should be of interest to many people.  It
is about our money system; no goods and services are worth
offering without a price attached, although the author doesn't
realize that he is talking about our Price System.  He blames
everything on technology and, unfortunately, most of those who
read this book will quite possibly agree.
<p>
Mander laments the fact that friends, who seemed receptive to
his idea of eliminating television would then say, "You don't
expect to succeed, do you?"  How receptive would Mander be to an
idea that promotes the intelligent use of technology for human
needs?  Probably not very.  In his latest book:  <cite>In the
Absence of the Sacred:  The Failure of Technology and the
Survival of the Indian Nations</cite> (1991), he offers more
arguments, this time for the elimination of technology.
<cite>Four Arguments for the Elimination of Television
</cite>came out in 1977.  At that time he said, "...the idea
of outlawing whole technologies is virtually unthinkable."
Fourteen years later he offers arguments for its demise, using
terminology such as technopian, technoideology, megatechnology,
utopian police state, techno-fantasy of immortality--"the
removal of the mind from the brain, where a computer-surgeon
'downloads' the contents of the human brain into a
robot..."
<p>
He believes that we should become more of a democracy where "all
human beings should have a say about technological developments
that may profoundly change, even threaten, their lives..."
Isn't a democracy what most human beings think we have now?  He
admits that to be knowledgeable on technical developments, the
people should have more education.  And because they don't, most
of the discussions involving technology take place between
"unelected surrogates, professionals and experts."  If this were
only true.]
<p>
And yet it is the tragedy of our times that those who have this
education and the knowledge to perform intelligently in a
technological age--our technologists from every field of
endeavor--do not have the power, while those who have the power-
-our politicians (a composite of businessmen and lawyers)--do
not have the scientific knowledge to perform adequately or
intelligently.  It is only natural that with their education on
how to succeed in the business world, money, not technology,
rules their decisions.
<p>
Jerry Mander believes that those TV personnel who line up people
for documentaries or to promote their book most often attempt to
adjust the personality to match the machine.  Undoubtedly he is
partly correct; but rather than adjust personalities to match
the machine, these personalities are more likely to be adjusted
to present the best attention catchers to those who will be the
most likely to adhere to the sponsors' advertisements.  To
purchase their products. To win high in the ratings so their
show can go on.  What does the mindless machine care about such
frivolities?  It's only there to do its master's bidding.
<p>
The author is most perceptive in defining our social ills, but
eliminating TV and all technology is not the answer.  Only the
intelligent use of technology can undo what years of its misuse
have wrought.  It is long past time that scientists are given an
exemplary place in society.  Even science fiction takes
precedence over science, but without the ingenuity of
scientists' inventions and engineers to carry out these
inventions, science fiction would be relegated to a less
exciting form of entertainment.  People might have to go back to
reading again.
<p>
In the Northwest spotted owl/old growth forest controversy, the
four scientists who laid out the survival rules for both owl and
forest are referred to as the "gang of four."  The politicians
who want to overthrow these decisions egotistically call
themselves the "god squad."
<p>
When President Bush honored 10 people for their achievements for
1992, not one scientist was included.  Yet without scientific
expertise, the entertainers who were most prominent on the list
couldn't have performed for millions of people on television or
on the stage.
<p>
Jerry Mander unwittingly revealed one of the problems facing
this continent today regarding our environment when he said:
"In 1974 I was one of 30 leading environmental educators invited
to attend a conference at Ann Arbor, Michigan, jointly sponsored
by the Environmental Education Program of the School of Natural
Resources of the University of Michigan and the Division of
Technology and Environmental Education of the U.S. Department
of Health, Education and Welfare.
<p>
"The goal of this conference was to provide guidelines to the
government on how to grant 'money' for environmental education
projects.  We 30 people would decide what is good and effective
environmental education and what is not.  We had four days to do
this..."  Only four days?
<p>
Where were the biologists, geologists, anthropologists,
meteorologists, chemists and other scientists who understand our
ecological systems best because they are educated to understand
them ?  Apparently left out, as is often the case, being blamed
for the technological ills that beset us instead of putting the
blame for the misuse of our technology where it belongs:  most
notably on the military, business enterprise and politics.
