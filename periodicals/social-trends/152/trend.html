<H1>Superfinancial System in State of Chaos</H1>
<!--AUTHOR--><H2>Clyde Wilson</H2>
<!--DATE--><h3>1998</h3>
<P>
The financial and currency meltdown among the Asia-Pacific countries has
created a chaotic condition that could engulf the financial and trade
markets throughout the world.  Even with the intercedence of the
International Monetary Fund as a lender of last resort, the attempt to
restore stability and confidence in the financial and monetary system
may act as only a temporary stopgap.  The magnitude of this crisis will
no doubt have a lingering and damaging impact on the economies of Asia
and the rest of the world.
<P>
While the officials of the International Monetary Fund have been accused
of failing to sound a warning alarm when it became evident that the
Pacific Rim countries were overextending their limits of debts and their
currencies were being devalued at an atypical rate, there was hardly any
concern that these countries were in serious financial trouble as it was
assumed that they would continue their phenomenal economic growth and
development.  South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and China had shown an
annual growth rate of 16 to 20 percent since the mid-1970s, with
Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia not far behind.
<P>
In an article that appeared in <cite>The Wall Street Journal</cite> by Brett
Fromson, he wrote that many of the ``experts'' in the world of high
finance advised that no one could ignore the Pacific Rim countries as
being an investors' paradise.  And just a month before the financial
distress signals became evident, the Money Magazine carried headlines
about the dazzling earnings and spectacular profits of these world's
fastest growing economies.  The euphoria became contagious among the
financial communities, multinationals, brokerage houses, governments and
even praise by the International Monetary Fund.  But as Fromson
concluded in his article, it was mass self-delusion among those experts
who seldom spot the important market turns.
<P>
Before the failure of the financial and monetary structure of the
Southeast and Southwest Asia countries, the main concern of the
industrial nations was centered on what has been referred to as ``hot
money.''  In June of 1995, the Group of Seven industrial nations held a
Summit for the specific purpose of dealing with the problem of ``hot
money,'' a multitrillion pool of capital that races around the world
dealing and searching for those stocks, bonds and currency markets that
bring the highest returns each day.  There is the concern and fear that
these practices could cause serious damage and shut down the entire
system of handling all financial transactions and exchanges worldwide.
<P>
So far there has not been any effective plan formulated to stop or
curtail the problem caused by ``hot money.''  As John M. Barry brought out
in his article that appeared in The Washington Post Weekly Edition of
April 24-30, 1995:  ``In this age of electronic money, the volitility of
currencies worldwide, and the rapid mobility and magnitude of money--
there was $418 trillion in currency transactions and exchanges by the
United States and international banks in 1988--makes drafting of any
effective controls to meet this problem unlikely (or improbable).  This
situation along with the present financial and debt crisis in Asia has
all the elements to bring about serious long-term repercussions to the
economies of the world.''
<P>
At the same Summit on the issue of ``hot money,'' the Clinton
administration offered a rather modest package aimed at discouraging
developing countries from employing risky economic and financial
strategies, such as the free fall of Mexico's currency in which the
United States and the American people got stuck again with billions of
dollars to bail out Mexico's economy.  But who would have thought among
the government and financial experts that the Pacific Rim countries'
financial structure would be in a state of collaps when they have had
unprecedented economic growth and development since World War II. 
<P>
<h3>Asia's Growing Economic Development & The Pitfalls Of Financial System</h3>
<P>
How was it possible for the economies of these undeveloped and
developing countries to grow at such a fast and high rate?  The economic
development of the Pacific Rim countries was hastened from by-passing
many of the trials and errors that other nations had to go through
during the industrial revolution, and by acquiring and applying the most
advanced and efficient methods in the production of goods and products.
From their economic progress they were in a position to receive
financial credit and to provide financial assistance and make reciprocal
trade agreements that would be beneficial to all of the countries in the
region.
<P>
But as their productivity and gross product increased, and as the
momentum of their economic growth and development surpassed all
expectations, it was assumed that the Pacific Rim ``tigers'' would catch
up or even surpass the industrial nations of the West.  But given the
inherent characteristics of a monetary system, these most promising
developing countries fell into the same pitfalls that are inevitable
when operating within the framework of a financial and price system.
<P>
Of all the countries in Southeast and Southwest Asia, Japan has been the
leader in the economic growth and development in the region.  While
Japan's Gross National Product has surpassed most of the industrial
nations in the world with the exception of the United States, for the
past seven or eight years its economy has been mired down from
over-extended loans, debts and poor investments.  Japan's Minister of
Finance estimates that its problem loans amount to $223 billion, but
U.S. bankers believe the figure is much higher because of the slipshod
disclosure methods used by Japan's financial institutions.  It is no
wonder that those banks and businesses in the United States that have
made loans and have assets in Japan are apprehensive about their
investments as a number of Japan's largest banks, credit and businesses
are in trouble.  And adding to Japan's financial and economic crisis,
Japan's banks made $299 billion in loans in 1996 to ten of the Asian
countries in the region (including Hong Kong),  that are now having the
same financial and economic problems as Japan.  (Asian countries account
for 44 percent of Japan's exports.)
<P>
In its gloomiest assessment of Japan's business outlook in two decades,
the government recently reported that the economy is stagnating, and it
is unclear when growth will resume.  The Bank of Japan's recent
quarterly survey reported that the biggest companies in Japan cited
sluggish economic growth at home and worries about the impact of Asia's
financial crisis for their deepest pessimism.  Adding to what has become
a consenus among observers of Japan's economic condition, Norio Ohga,
chairman of Sony Corporation speaking to reporters in Tokyo shortly
after the Japanese central bank's release of its latest survey on the
nation's economy said:  ``The Japanese economy is on the verge of
collapsing.  If the economic situation continues to decline...it will no
doubt have a damaging effect on the world economy.''  He warned that the
robust American economy could take a hit if Japan's economy continues to
slump.  ``Even the U.S. economy will not be able to maintain its healthy
state,'' he said.
<P>
Corporate confidence in Japan's economy has hit an all-time low.  And
Japanese companies are blaming the government for not implementing
effective measures to stimulate business.  But up to this point, the
Japanese government has been reluctant in putting into place any
measures that they consider might have a harmful effect on the economy
of the nation.
<P>
An article by David P. Hamilton that appeared in
<cite>The Wall Street Journal</cite> (3/23/98)
goes into considerable detail concerning Japan's
economic position and policies.  The insistence of U.S. pressure on
Japan to stimulate its economy by cutting taxes, raising spending by at
least 10 trillion yen ($76.52 billion), open up its import markets and
work with the International Monetary Fund to restore its credit and debt
structure has met with considerable resistance.  Japan's government
officials are warning the Clinton Administration that its
recommendations to stimulate Japan's domestic consumption are ``not
constructive.''  The newly appointed Finance Minister, Hikaru Matsunaga,
has made it clear that Japan would judge on its own what economic
stimulus to deploy.  ``We don't plan to draft stimulus steps based on the
direction by other countries.''
<P>
While there have been some conflicting viewpoints as to what Japan's
intentions are to stimulate its sagging economy, Japanese Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto defended his government's economic policies at a
recent summit held in London by the European and Asian Countries.  His
highly touted tax cut, which includes a $340 savings to the average
Japanese household, has been criticized by economists as not being
enough to reverse Japan's economic slide.  And there is a serious
concern, especially in the United States, that the weakness in Japan's
yen will result in a flood of goods and products into the export markets
and will continue to raise U.S. trade deficits that are already the
largest in the world.
<P>
Repercussions from Japan's economic stagnation has brought increasing
hardships to the Japanese people.  The once guaranteed security of
Japanese work in their jobs has come to an end.  Businesses and industry
are downsizing and permanently terminating workers as the once booming
economy is now going through its most critical period.
<P>
What seems ironic in what is happening in Japan at this juncture is the
fact that the Japanese people have trillions of dollars in savings, but
because of the continued decline and uncertainty in the country's
economy they have become extra cautious of cashing in or spending these
funds on what is not necessary in the present circumstances.  Being
privy to the malpractices of Japan's banking and financial operations,
and the collusion that has taken place between government officials and
the business-financial establishment, the Japanese people have lost
confidence and are skeptical of the country's leadership and the
direction the nation is going at the present time.  (It could be that
the trillions of dollars in savings by the Japanese people are merely on
paper, and it is doubtful that those banks and financial institutions
that are still solvent in Japan have the reserves to cover these
savings.)
<P>
The government of Japan has been seriously considering withdrawing some
of the country's investments it has in U.S. government securities for
the purpose of meeting some of its debt obligations and as a means to
stimulate its economy.  Considering the government of the United States
depends on Japan and other foreign investments when it comes to selling
and auctioning off its securities, the question comes up as to what
impact will this have on the U.S. economy and the government of the
United States that already has the largest debt of any nation in the
world.  Without the creation of debt, this economy and the operation of
the Government would collapse and become inoperative. (Next, Economic
Chaos Reigns Throughout Asia)
<P>
<H3>Economic Chaos Reins Throughout Asia</H3>
<P>
In spite of the phenomenal economic growth of the Pacific Rim countries,
none has escaped the domino effect that has beset their financial and
economic state of affairs.  South Korea is one of the countries in the
region that developed into the 11th productive nation in the world.  Now
it finds its economy in disarray with debts into the billions of dollars
and has no way to meet the obligations of its creditors.  Financed by
multinational corporations and foreign investors that have businesses
and holdings there, it finds itself between a rock and a hard place as
debts continue to mount.
<P>
There are increasing doubts that the bailout by the International
Monetary Fund of $57 billion will be adequate to stop the financial and
economic hemorrhaging that South Korea is now going through.  There are
reports that it will take at least $150 billion to bring about some
stability to the financial and currency crisis of South Korea.  Like the
rest of the Pacific-Asia countries, it has been plagued with speculative
over-building, nonperforming loans and investments, and the underwriting
of the banks to keep its industrial and business conglomerates afloat. 
(Two of its former Presidents were jailed for collusion, corruption and
accepting bribes and recently released by the newly elected President.)
<P>
In the past, South Korea has had a strict restrictive trade policy.  The
government has vigilantly guarded its automobile and computer chip
industries from foreign competition by providing unending loans,
incentives, tax benefits, high tariffs and other trade barriers to keep
the share of its domestic market by foreign countries to a minimum.  But
by accepting the loan from the IMF, it will have to restructure its
financial system and open up its markets and financial services to
foreign investors and other vested interests.
<P>
Already the parliament of South Korea has passed a law simplifying the
procedure for companies to fire workers.  Union leaders have charged
that this law will throw out of work at least 1.5 million Korean workers
this year, and they have vowed to fight this law to keep their jobs. The
requirements by the IMF for a loan to carry out its austerity program
will only aggravate South Korea's economic problems and create an
explosive situation of uncontrollable social unrest. This in turn will
provide opportunities for foreign financial and business interests to
capitalize on the calamity of South Korea's financial and economic
plight.  (South Korea's largest carmaker, Hyundai Motor Company, has
slashed production 60 percent because of mounting inventory of unsold
cars.  Hyundai produced 5000 cars a day before the financial crisis hit
the country.  It is producing only 2000 cars a day now.  A strike by
13,300 unionized workers at Kia Motors Corporation, who took to the
streets in Seoul's anti-government rally demanding job security,
halted production at South Korea's third-largest automaker.)
<P>
<H3>Financial-Currency Meltdown All-Embracing</H3>
<P>
The spread of the financial and currency meltdown has been extensive and
all-embracing in the Asia-Pacific region.  Indonesia with a government
that has been under the control of President Suharto for over three
decades now finds its economy devastated and overwhelmed with debt and
currency problems.  It is estimated to have $140 billion in external
debts that is owed to private companies.  And Indonesia companies also
owe $65 billion to foreign banks.  The bulk of these borrowings are in
U.S. dollars, meaning that these debts have become increasingly more
expensive to service.
<P>
During the past three-decades, every facet of Indonesia's economy has
been under the control of President Suharto along with his family and in
collusion with the inner circle of the financial-business elite.  Under
Suharto, the operation of Indonesia's economy had become a syndicated
plutocracy.  As a result of greed, corruption, bribes and all of the
other characteristics of a financial and monetary system permeated
throughout the economy until it collapsed from its artificial indulgence
or its own weight.  Now Indonesia is confronted with mounting domestic
problems.
<P>
While in the throes of a financial and currency crisis, President
Suharto has tried to reassure the Indonesian people that the government
could deal with the economic problem by announcing a new budget plan but
failed to specify what reform measure would be taken to meet the growing
social problems.  At one time, Indonesia's currency (the rupia) had lost
as high as 80 percent of its value since Asia's financial and currency
meltdown.  As a result of the rupiah's free fall in value, it created a
panic among the people of the world's fourth most populous country. 
According to a report by Geoff Spencer of the Associated Press from
Jakarta, people lined up more than 20 deep at the cash registers to buy
rice, sugar, cooking oil and anything they could grab from the shelves
before another price rise and before the rupiah depreciated any further.
<P>
The economic crisis has ignited centuries-old ethnic and religious
tensions.  Rioting and looting have broken out in many parts of the
country.  Making up only about 4 percent of Indonesia's population of
202 million, the ethnic Chinese have often been targets since Dutch
colonizers allowed the Chinese into Indonesia hundreds of years ago. 
Those Indonesians who have been hurt the most from Indonesia's economic
crisis have vented their anger at the Chinese merchants who have become
a major force in the country.  President Suharto has called on companies
to ease the pain of the millions of low-income and unemployed
Indonesians.  To placate the rioters and looters who have targeted
Chinese merchants, some of the most influential and rich are
distributing food parcels and truck loads of rice, noodles and cooking
oil to Indonesia's neediest families.  It is unlikely that the magnitude
of Indonesia's underlying social and economic problems can be checked by
temporary expediencies and mere palliatives.  And any sweeping measures
to reconstruct Indonesia's economic and financial crisis by the
implementation of austerity programs can only worsen what has already
become a highly volatile situation.
<P>
There is nothing tangible to show that Indonesia's economic dilemma is
getting any better, and it may be getting worse.  Gerald Baker's article
that appeared in the Financial Times (3/17/98) makes mention of some of
the reasons why Indonesia's economy is in a state of flux.  In this
article Baker dwells on the conflict that is going on between President
Suharto and colleagues with accepting and carrying out some of the
programs of the International Monetary Fund.  As Baker points out, two
of the programs crafted by the IMF had collapsed since October, and the
unprecedented third that just began in April has no guaranty that it
will be any more successful than the previous programs.  Because of the
obstructive nature of President Suharto, the Congress of the United
States with the U.S. Government being the largest contributor to the IMF
is no longer willing to approve more contributions to the IMF without
implementing tough conditions on Indonesia.  While the harshest
criticism has been vented against President Suharto and his elitist
partners, there is now growing crass remarks about the IMF's programs
and its inability to deal with the financial and economic problems of
Indonesia and the Pacific-Asia countries.
<P>
Of all the countries in Asia that have felt the impact of the economic
crisis, Thailand is going through one of its most serious currency and
trade difficulties.  Thailand's currency (the baht) has already lost
half of its value against the U.S. dollar.  It finds it difficult for
its companies and businesses to obtain the finances that are necessary
to buy the materials and the commodities to produce the products for
export and domestic consumption.  And the depreciation of the baht along
with rising prices has created increasing social and internal problems
that must be dealt with now.
<P>
Thailand must undergo more austerity measures to receive a $10 billion
loan from the Internatinal Monetary Fund.  To meet the requirements of
the IMF, Thailand has already closed 42 troubled banks and companies,
bringing to 58 the number that have been closed since June of the past
year.  Like most of the other Asian countries that have been affected by
the financial and economic crisis, many of Thialand's banks and
businesses were in deep trouble from excessive lending to developers of
real estate who overbuilt and could not sell these properties or find
clients to occupy them.  Not to mention that cooking the books became a
common practice.
<P>
In an attempt to keep some of its financial institutions and companies
afloat, Thailand's central bank has lent $15.6 billion to those
companies that are still solvent to stem the downward spiral of its
currency and as a means to prop up or give the economy a shot in the
arm.  But Thailand is faced with a number of social and economic
problems that will be difficult to overcome in spite of the measures the
IMF and Thailand's central bank have taken to jump-start Thailand's
economy and prevent it from deteriorating further.
<P>
Thailand's Minister of Labor estimates that 2 million more Thais will be
out of work over the next few months.  About 1.5 million Thais have
already lost their jobs as companies have gone bankrupt or laid off
workers during the free fall of the baht.  As a result in the decline of
exports, bad loans to builders and contractors during the building boom,
and the heavy borrowing by the banks in foreign loans, Thailand's
economy has been in disarray since 1996.
<P>
As the natives become more restless from what is happening in Thailand,
it could set off an explosive situation or develop into one. Political
and social tensions are nothing new in Thailand; it has suffered through
more than a dozen coups in the past 50 years.  Without a stable and
viable domestic economy, and not being neophytes at insurrection and
overthrowing past governments, anything can happen in Thailand under the
present circumstances and under the controlling regime.  There are
reports out of Thailand that the people have soured and are turning away
from Western ways.
<P>
Compared with other Asian countries that are heavily in debt and where
their currencies have depreciated as much as 50 percent, so far
Singapore's currency has fallen only 14 percent against the dollar.  Up
to this point, Singapore has managed to avoid many of the pitfalls that
have plagued most of the countries in the region because of its
favorable foreign reserves of about $74 billion and due to its flexible
currency.  But the fact that close to 50 percent of its exports go to
the neighboring Asian countries, and half of those exports are in
electronic products, who among these importing countries are in any
position to finance and buy Singapore's products.  It appears that under
the present trade policies, any regeneration of Singapore's and the
other Asian nations' economies will depend on the recovery of the entire
region, which could be many years away.  In the meantime Singapore will
have to take steps to deal with the social problems that the other
nations in the region are confronted with before the situation becomes
unmanageable.
<P>
Like Singapore, Malaysia's economic conditions may not be as severe as
the other Asia-Pacific nations.  Nevertheless, its debts and the
depreciation of its currency has become a serious concern in the
country.  Malaysia is taking sweeping new austerity measures to slow
down the deterioration of the financial system.  In an effort to prevent
further erosion of its financial and debt crisis, finance minister Anwar
Ibrahim has announced that the government would cut spending by 18
percent.  If implemented, this new policy by the government will hit
corporate enterprise hard and is expected to slow Malaysia's growth and
development to its lowest level since 1986.
<P>
The new policies are designed to accept slower growth and development
even at the expense of economic stability.  One of the purposes of the
new program is to reduce credit growth--currently expanding at 25
percent a year--and tighten credit policies on non-performing property
loans and restrict lending for stock purchases.  It will also make every
effort to shore up its foreign exchange reserves that have slipped to
$24 billion from more than $27 billion at the end of 1996.
<P>
In a recent meeting, Director Michel Camdessus of the International
Monetary Fund praised Prime Minister Mahathir  Mohamad for Maylasia's
tenacity to put in place those programs to overcome its economic and
financial crisis.  But whether the corporate interests and the populace
will accept the cutbacks along with rising prices and increasing
unemployment just to maintain the financial system is another matter for
the government to contend with.  The people can only endure so much
privation before the situation becomes intolerable.  With the present
state of Malaysia's economy, the corporate sector will need all of the
incentives it can get from the government to stimulate their businesses
and activities rather than restrictive measures as proposed by the
International Monetary Fund.
<P>
The Philippines has many of the same financial and currency problems
that plague the other Southeast and Southwest Asian countries.  In an
attempt to prevent any further decline and stabilize its financial
system that is at a critical stage, the Philippine Central Bank is
teaming up with commercial banks to check the scramble for dollars that
has the peso reeling.  In its program to provide large credits to
hard-hit-countries, the IMF has allocated $650 million to the
Philippines to meet its most pressing economic and financial problems. 
But even with the loans from the IMF, the Philippine government and
companies will need additional funds to make payments on its foreign
debts, pay for needed imports, and buy those raw materials and
commodities that are essential to put its economy back in order.
<P>
The Philippine economy is still trying to recover from the devastation
that occurred during the reign of the Marcus regime.  But even with the
help of the International Monetary Fund in directing the Philippine
economy toward a market economy and the privatization of its banks and
government enterprises, it will still need a massive infusion of
economic aid or a new direction if the country is to bring stability to
the economy and greater equality to all of the people.  Poverty is still
rampant and the disparity in income has not changed over the years to
ameliorate the social deprivation.  Most of the wealth is still in the
hands of the large landowners and the business-financial elite.  While
already heavy in debt, just making more loans and going further in debt
or merely udnertaking palliatives to cushion the shock of its crisis is
not a viable long-term solution for the economic and currency problems
for the Philippines.
<P>
Just where does Hong Kong fit in with the economic and financial crisis
that has had a deteriorating effect of the economies of Asia?  For one
thing, Hong Kong is considered the finance capital of East Asia. 
According to a report by Sara Webb in <cite>The Wall Street Journal</cite>, Hong Kong
is likely to remain so for some time in the future.  As for its economy
since the British handed its colonial control of Hong Kong to China,
there has not been any radical changes in the way Hong Kong operates its
economic affairs.  Even before the takeover of Hong Kong by China, the
``communist'' government in China announced that it would not interfere
with the ``free enterprise'' system as practiced by Hong Kong during the
British rule.
<P>
Regardless of the difference in government operations and economic
systems between Hong Kong and mainland China, they have been doing
business with each other over a period of many years.  As partners they
have been making investments and raising capital at a rapid pace with a
considerable amount of these funds being used to update China's
infrastructure, such as energy development, telecommunications and
transport construction.  As part of China's modernization program, the
cost of the Three River Gorge dam will cost billions of dollars. This
partnership between Hong Kong and China may have a number of obstacles
to overcome before it can become beneficial to all concerned.
<P>
While China has opened up its economy and has become less restrictive to
foreign trade, it is not oblivious to what has happened to the financial
structure of the rest of Asia.  Confronted with its own internal
economical problems, China plans to inject more capital into its shaky
banking system.  China's state banks are in a precarious condition with
loans outstanding exceeding $1 trillion, the equivalent to its annual
economic output.  The World Bank estimates that 20 percent of the loans
are bad, and the banks have less than 1 percent set aside in reserves to
cover those loans.  China's banking and financial system has reached the
point where it will have to undergo a major shakeout or overhaul if its
internal-domestic economic trade deficit with China has mushroomed to
$50 billion (some estimates put the figure at $62 billion) and could
surpass Japan as the leading exporter nation to the United States.
<P>
While the building of the Three River Gorge dam will provide China with
more clean energy and facilitate its industrial and commercial
development, the downside will in all probability outweigh its
advantages.  The dam will result in the dislocation and relocation of
over a million Chinese farmers, towns and the people who live in the
area.  It is a no-win undertaking as China with 1.2 billion population
has, according to China's government statistics, lost more than half of
its arable land in the past 40 years.  With 1/5th of the world's
population, China has only 1/15 of the world's arable land.  Considering
all of the factors and the problems confronting China, demographics,
lack of arable land and its geological resource base will determine
China's future, not growth and development and world free trade based on
merely financial considerations.
<P>
There are going to be many questions concerning what impact the Asian
financial meltdown will have on the economies of the rest of the world.
It is obvious that the magnitude of the financial and currency crisis
has had severe economic repercussions on Southeast and Southwest Asia. 
Those nations that have investments, holdings and do business on a large
scale with the Pacific-Asian region will take a hard hit from the
financial fallout that has encompassed the Asian area.  There is no way
to ignore the fact that the domino effect has serious economic
implications in a world where globalization and world trade have become
a dominant force.
<P>
<cite>The Wall Street Journal's</cite> edition on World Business
reports a detailed
account of the extent of the global competition that is going on between
investors and borrowers for the business of developing countries,
especially those nations in the Asia region.  With the title of Money
Hunger in this issue on World Business, Urban C. Lehner reports that in
1990 only 12 countries had 84 percent of all private investments, but
since then their share of the investments dropped to 74 percent as a
result of competition from other countries.  Since 1990 the private flow
of investments in the economies of the developing countries increased
five-fold to $243.8 billion.  In 1990 the Pacific Asian nations received
investments amounting to only $19.3 billion but by 1996 private foreign
investments had increased to $108.7 billion and continued at a much
faster rate.
<P>
Those private investors who represent some of the largest companies and
financial institutions were convinced that the economies of the
developing countries would continue to grow and develop at a high and
sustainable rate.  Now that most of these developing countries are on
the brink of financial and economic disaster, the loss of the private
investors and brokerage houses of those Americans who have part of their
portfolio in these speculative ventures will no doubt have serious
repercussions on their life savings and pension funds not to mention the
balance sheets of some of the leading world banks and financial
institutions.
<P>
<H3>Reverberations from Asian Financial Fallout</H3>
<P>
There have been different points of view as to what extent the financial
fallout in Asia will affect the economy of the United States.  There are
reports that the financial and currency problems of the region will have
a minimal bearing on the overall economy of the United States while
other assessments present just the opposite outlook.  Regardless of what
observation of the financial and economic crisis prevails, there are
already indicators that the financial breakdown of the Asian countries
is having economic reverberations in the United States and in other
parts of the world.
<P>
As a result of Asia's financial predicament and the volatility of the
commodity markets, the suppliers of commodities and raw materials will
have to make major adjustments in their economies to meet this downturn.
Last year's immediate trigger for price declines came from Asia, a major
source of commodities demand growth this decade.  Aaron Lucchetti's
article in <cite>The Wall Street Journal</cite> (1/2/98) reported that
Asia's problems 
have hurt a wide range of the commodities market from cotton to soybeans
to copper and platinum, especially those with consumption heavily
concentrated in the developing region's countries.
<P>
As one of the major suppliers of all kinds of commodities, goods and
services to the Asian region, a number of industries and businesses in
the United States have been hard hit by Asia's financial crisis.  The
demand of base metals and other materials for building projects has come
to a halt.  As a result, the copper industry in the United States has
reduced its production; this in turn forced massive layoffs of its
workers.  It is expected that more than $2 billion of U.S. farm exports
will be lost this year.  To offset this impact on U.S. agribusinesses
and the farmers of the nation, Secretary Dan Glickman of the Department
of Agriculture has decided to expand a government program to facilitate
farm exports, lifting the Asian allotment from $455 million to 
$2 billion.  The United States has been over the years a large supplier
of meat, corn, soybeans, hides, poultry, fruits, and other products and
raw materials to the countries in Asia.  But, according to Donald
Mitchell of the World Bank, commodity markets throughout the world have
been overwhelmed from the surge of investments and technological
advances.  As a result, massive investments in overdevelopment have
created an untenable economic condition worldwide.
<P>
Considering the plight of the Asian people from the breakdown of the
nation's financial and economic system, the reconstruction, restoration
and perpetuation of the financial system becomes secondary in the
overall scheme of things.  The social and economic conditions in these
countries is already in an intolerable state where there are riots and
demonstrations by the people calling for the leadership to step down or
make way for a viable and more humane change in the social and economic
operation.  Increasing repression without making any provision to
alleviate the deprivation of the people by the government leaders could
lead to an explosive situation and possibly revolution.
<P>
By treating merely the symptoms of Asia's economic ills with what
amounts to only Keynesian initiatives, the International Monetary Fund
has not been received in the Asia-Pacific countries without skepticism
and trepidation.  Most of these nations have not been keen or receptive
to the severity of the requirements by the IMF before any loan is
forthcoming. They have expressed their objections to opening up their
financial and domestic economy where foreign investors and interests can
capitalize on their present extreme misfortune.  And the populace of
these countries are well aware that they will take the brunt of IMF's
austerity program and endure more unemployment, poverty and hunger.  The
end result will be greater suffering among the people who have already
been caught up in the web weaved out of the chaos of the financial and
Price System.
<P>
Those Asian nations that have felt the shock of the financial and
economic breakdown are beginning to have second thoughts about their
role in the present world of high finance and global trade.  Some of the
leaders and officials of these countries are questioning and blaming the
region's economic crisis on the transactions and exchanges of a monetary
system that is controlled by those interests in the West, maintaining
the system is stacked against them.  They would prefer that the standard
for their currency be based on the Japanese yen rather than the dollar,
or the establishment of their own currency for the region.
<P>
While the economies of China and India were once spurned by the
countries in Asia as anachronistic, they are now being held up as
examples to prevent future financial and economic disaster.  China and
India have imposed tight controls on the flow of foreign capital and
investments and kept in place what they consider necessary trade
barriers.  According to a report by Uli Schmetzer in the Chicago
Tribune, China and India have remained relatively unscathed by the Asian
economic crisis.
<P>
More than anythng else, the countries of the developing and
underdeveloped world want to control their own destiny rather than be
shackled and held hostage where they have to pay millions of dollars in
interest to the rich countries and are forever making huge payments on
loans and investments to the world's largest industrial nations and the
biggest private banks. (The amount owed by the Third World and
developing nations has been estimated at more than $2 trillion.)  They
do not see much difference from the economic imperialism of the present
era than the colonial imperialism of the past.  They are beginning to
look upon the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank as merely
fronts for the richest countries and only concerned with maintaining the
status quo of the financial and monetary system.  These organizations
were not designed to take into consideration those factors that are
essential in maintaining and operating a sustainable resource and
economic base in the developing nations.  
<P>
In a speech held in Hong Kong during September 1997 before the
finance ministers and central bankers from 180 countries regarding
currency fluctuations, capital inflows, GDP's, and market
transparency, James Wolfensohn, president of the World Bank, made what
seems to be a contrast to the agenda at this summit meeting with the
following statement:  ``We are living in a time bomb and unless we take
action now, it could explode in our children's faces.''  He emphasized
the point by the fact that 3 billion of the world's population live on
$2 a day; 1.3 billion on less than $1 a day; and 150 million never go
to school. 
<P>
Like most former representatives of the business and financial
establishment who are appointed to responsible positions in the federal
government--and who seem to be out of touch with reality--, U.S.
Treasury Department Secretary Robert Rubin said at the same summit that
it was in the interest of the United States for the developing countries
to continue to develop, because the richer they become, the more U.S.
exports they will buy.  Secretary Rubin must have been out to lunch when
Wolfensohn made his speech during the proceedings at the meeting.  With
one-third of U.S. exports going to Asia, and with most of these
countries having severe currency and debt problems and their overall
economy in disarray, U.S. exports to these countries will be bleak for a
long time to say the least.  With half of the world working at slave and
starvation wages, maybe world free trade is a misnomer and should be
changed to half-world free trade.  (Source of the information came from
Thomas Wagner, Associated Press.)
<P>
The cure of Asia's financial and economic collapse is no better than the
disease that is plaguing the economies of the Asia-Pacific countries. 
Considering the magnitude of the damage that has been done to the
economy of the region, it is doubtful that just restructuring the
financial and banking system will bring about long-term stability and
balance in the operation of their economies:  Not within the framework
of the same financial and monetary system that brought about the present
economic crisis.  It is ironic that the value of the currencies in most
Asian countries is compared with the American dollar, yet the United
States is the largest debtor nation and has the greatest trade deficit
in this global world of free trade and a market oriented economy.
<P>
Unless there is a comprehensive and fundamental conversion from the
financial and monetary system (and all that it entails), and a medium
based on a measurable and invariable standard put in its place, there
will be no end to the economic breakdowns and the resulting cataclysmic
aftermath to the countries and the people of the world.  The world will
continue to have booms and busts, recessions and depressions, inflation,
deflation and stagnation, panics and crashes, graft and corruption,
bankruptcies and defaults speculation, etc.  All of the consequences
that are inherent characteristics of a monetary and price system.
<P>
Instead of mobilizing our resources, expertise, technological know-how
and personnel to restructure, maintain and perpetuate the anachronism of
the monetary and financial system, America could lead the way by using
its inventiveness for the purpose of implementing a new method of
operating the social and industrial mechanism for a new system that
would bring an equilibrium in the production and distribution of goods
and services.  Laying everything aside, this transformation should be
our first and most important priority now and with the coming of the
21st century.
