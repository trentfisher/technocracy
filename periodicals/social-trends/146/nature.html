<p>
Three centuries ago, North America was a virgin continent.  It was
abundantly rich in soil, timber, minerals, and wild life.  Only a
fraction of its vast area had ever been touched by the hand of the
white man.  Its wealth seemed inexhaustible.
<p>
Today a great part of this natural heritage is gone, and more is going
fast. In the headlong commercial expansion of our frontiers and
exploitation of our resources, there was little care for the future.
Our forests are disappearing.  Our land is giving way to erosion.  As
a consequence of this devastating neglect, greater and greater areas
of America are turning to desert and her rivers are causing
successively greater flood disasters.
<p>
This havoc wrought by wind and water cannot be blamed on Nature.  The
depletion of soils and forests and the destructiveness of the floods
are the results of humankind's activities.
<p>
Nature was exceptionally good to this Continent.  She set mountains on
the eastern and western sides, creating a valley in the center drained
by the Mighty Father of Waters, and protected its face with grasses
and forests.
<p>
Nature laid out the Mississippi River to drain 31 states and two
provinces of Canada, or 43.7 percent of the total area of Continental
United States.  This mighty river has thousands of tributaries
extending from the state of Pennsylvania to the state of Montana, or,
from the Rocky Mountains to the Appalachian Mountains.  As the water
must be carried down to the Gulf of Mexico in one major channel,
Nature regulated this great area by growing forests, brush, and
grasses along its adjoining streams and rivers.  The forest protected
the ground from frost, leaving it porous and sponge-like so that the
snow, when it fell, could melt and soak in, feeding the subterranean
channels gradually and thus keeping the water table normal.  The
forests acted as a guard against the hot sun and winds, thus tempering
the climate and also regulating the flow of the streams.
<p>
The upper tributaries were of a winding nature, along which the
beavers built dams, creating a natural  check-dam system.  Sudden
floods were thus averted; the major channels were fed gradually.  The
swamps covering a large area in the Middle Western and Northern states
acted as storage basins for the early rains and runoff from melting
snows.  The roots of grass and plants held the topsoil of the great
plains in place.  This Continent was in dynamic equilibrium, or
natural balance; nature had built a perfect system of drought and
flood control to protect the fertile soil.  Animal and plant life
continued to develop in harmony through thousands of years.
<p>
The American Indians were lovers of nature and in their lore and
traditions knew the forests to be a shelter for birds and game and the
regulator of the streams.  But the White Man has taken soil fertility
for granted, has destroyed and sold it off as though it were as
inexhaustible as the air.  We financed the building of America by
trading soil capital for Old World money capital.  It was a costly
trade. Within a couple of generations many farms have passed through
the destructive cycle from virgin soil to ruin.
<p>
In the interest of settling this country, it was the national policy
to dispose of the public domain as quickly as possible. Grants were
made right and left to all sorts of groups and individuals, a great
many of whom considered land and forests merely as something to be
acquired and exploited or resold at a profit.  During only two
decades, the 1850s and 1860s,   there passed into the hands of western
railroad promoters and builders a total of 158,293,000 acres, an area
almost equaling that of the New England States, New York, and
Pennsylvania combined.
<p>
This quick transfer of the land from public to private ownership was
accompanied by settlement and commercialization.  Great areas of
grazing lands were plowed for the first time and turned into crop
lands.  Timber cutting became an industry.  Thus began the upsetting
of Nature's dynamic equilibrium in the soil and forests that is
resulting in an annual waste of resources far greater and more serious
than most individuals realize.
<p>
Keystone in the equilibrium were the forests.  Besides their effect of
binding the soil together with their roots and checking the flow of
water and the melting of snow, trees have a tremendous influence on
precipitation.  Trees are a primary cause of much local rain; without
them moisture laden air might drift over great distances, away from
where rain is needed. Trees also emit much moisture through their
leaves.  Over a given area, trees can give out into the atmosphere, by
&quot;transpiration&quot;, more moisture than that which will
evaporate from a body of water covering a like area.
<p>
Thus, forests prevent sudden water flow, or floods; they cause local
rains; they form windbreaks; and they give off much-needed moisture to
surrounding country.  But as we mentioned above, most of our original
forests have been destroyed &#151; much of it wastefully.  And only a
small part has been replanted.  With the destruction of our forests,
water and winds have been free to erode our soil.
<p>
The destruction of our soil cannot be measured in dollars and cents.
Ten billion dollars could not buy back the top soil that has been
washed into the ocean, taken out by crops, or blown away.  It is
irreplaceable.  Oddly enough, soil, the Continent's most valuable
resource, is the last of the Continent's important natural resources
to become the object of popular conservation interest.  The urgency
for protecting it from wasteful destruction is one of the greatest.
<p>
Fertility may be lost or removed from the soil in four distinctly
different ways:  (1) By erosion, either through surface washing or
wind action; (2) by harvesting crops; (3) by leaching (draining away
to deeper soil), and (4) by volatilization (escaping into the
atmosphere). In most areas, erosion and crop harvesting cause the
greatest losses.  Because cropping requires cultivation and
cultivation increases erosion losses, the two causes are obviously
interrelated in the problem of erosion. The most serious of all soil
losses is the loss of the soil itself through the action of water and
wind.  Of the two forces, water and wind, water usually causes the
most spectacular and destructive erosion.
<p>
With the soil-binding vegetation uprooted and the topsoil blown away,
nothing is left to hold the rain and away it goes &#151; loaded with
more soil &#151; to the ocean.  So floods, too, continue to get bigger
and more destructive as time passes.
<p>
It should be evident that tons of this Continent's
irreplaceable soil resources are being wasted by various forms of
erosion and depletion.
<p>
It should be evident that as soon as possible a Continent-wide program
to combat this destruction must be undertaken.
