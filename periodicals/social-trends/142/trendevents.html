I.G. Farben industries, a company that evokes outrage for
the thousands it worked and put to death at Auschwitz, still exists, much to
the revulsion of its victims who survived the holocaust.
<p>
At I.G. Farben's recent meeting there ensued shouting matches between
company managers and several protesters who demanded that I.G. Farben be
liquidated immediately and the assets and proceeds of the company be paid to
the survivors of its inhuman treatment.
<p>
Demonstrators outside of the meeting displayed placards that depicted the
atrocities committed by I.G. Farben industries during World War II.  Of the
many signs, Peter Gingold wore a sandwich board that read, ``My brother and
sister were murdered with poison gas from I.G. Farben.''  Gingold has been
protesting at the company's annual meeting for the past ten years.  He said,
``The existence of this company makes a mockery of its victims.  Their shares
are stained with blood.''
<p>
While a number of big corporations and banks, including the Deutsche Bank,
Germany's largest private bank that recently helped publish a history
describing the bank's role in stripping Jews of their property in the 1930s,
have shown a willingness to face up to their fascist past and have made some
financial restitution, the role of I.G. Farben in the holocaust and its
existence still remains an insult to the victims and survivors of its notorious
synthetic rubber plant at Auschwitz and the production of the Zyklon-B cyanide
tablets used to gas hundreds of thousands of concentration camp
inmates.
<p>
The management of I.G. Farben has stated that it has paid its debt to the
victims, and that its first duty now is to its creditors and stockholders,
pointing out that the company paid out $8 million in 1957 to the U.S. based
Jewish Claims Conference, which compensated an estimated 10,000 western
European, Israeli and U.S. Jews.  It did not pay eastern European Jews and
non-Jewish victims, including thousands of Poles.  (Associated Press,
<cite>The Evansville Courier</cite>, 8-10-95)
<p>
<i>At the Nuremberg Trials (site of international trials, 1945-46), a number of
fascist leaders of Germany of World War II were tried, convicted and sentenced
for war crimes.  But those institutions--industry, financial and businesses
such as I.G. Farben, Krupp, the Deutsche Bank, etc. were not tried, yet without
their support and backing before and during World War II, it would have been
impossible for
fascism to come into being and mount the largest devastation and carnage in
the history of humankind.  When profits are to be made, business knows no
enemies.  Even during World War II it was not unfashionable or unpatriotic to
deal and trade with the enemy, directly or indirectly.  The price and financial
system is never put on trial for its devious acts.  After all wars, it
is back to business as usual, and
maximizing profits and keeping the system intact takes precedence over
everything else.</i>
