In the 1930s, Spencer Tracy and Franchot Tone starred in a World War I movie
titled, <cite>We Teach Them To Kill.</cite> This movie did not become
a blockbuster, and certainly neither the government nor the military
heartily supported it; the essence of its message was strong stuff.
<p>
Franchot Tone started out as a timid draftee with Tracy as his war buddy who
tried to help him overcome his fear of guns, and killing in self defense.  Even
running a bayonet through a straw dummy caused Tone to turn squeamish and
faint.  As the war progressed, however, he began to recognize the power his gun
gave him.  By the time the war ended, killing an enemy soldier didn't phase him
one bit.  Even as the bells tolled, announcing the end of the war, he couldn't
resist picking off one more enemy soldier who had already thrown down his gun,
overjoyed that the war was over.
<p>
<b><i>World War I</i></b> servicemen returned home to face economic hard
times. Tone supported himself with his gun, robbing and killing to make
an indecent living. In the end Tracy, who never enjoyed killing anyone, even
enemy soldiers, shot Tone in self defense.  As he looked down on his former
friend's lifeless body, he said: ``We taught him to kill.''
<p>
Of course this was fiction, but how many times can the reason for acts of
violence be traced to a warped outlook from training for war and war itself.
And nowhere are masters so adept in the training of potential killers as those
who teach the young and impressionable how to prepare for war.
<p>
The one thing these fledgling warriors are not taught is that if no one
profited from war, there would be no wars.  In <b><i>World War II</i></b>
billionaires were made while young men risked their lives on the battlefield
for $30 a month. By the time those who survived returned home, they had lost
several years of their youth to war while the armchair warriors raked in the
profits.
<p>
<b><i>World War I</i></b>, claimed by politicians to be the war to end
all wars, preceded the <i>Great Depression.</i>  Twenty years later <b><i>World
War Two</i></b> proved that all wars hadn't ended as promised by earlier
leaders, but this war pulled the economy up to heights never before known,
ending the <i>Great Depression</i>.  Preparation for war created new jobs, at
least for as long as the war lasted, and thousands of the young workers gave up
their jobs to go to war. There were so many jobs around, one could make a
choice, and many women went to work for the first time.
<p>
After the success of <b><i>World War II</i></b>in building up the
economy, hey...why not have perpetual war!  We were blessed with the
Korean War, and Vietnam, and the long, cold war with Russia.
Government-induced propaganda against Russia and other countries became so
instilled in the American people that many of them haven't recovered from it
yet.  Few complained about the unprovoked military assault on Grenada: the
CIA-assisted mining of a Nicaraguan harbor; unilateral support of so-called
``contra'' terrorists directed by old Somoza types; extensive and caring
assistance to Marcos and Duvalier, both well-known criminals in their own
countries; the bombing of Libya, which killed Muammar Qaddafi's infant
daughter; CIA assistance in the assassination of the duly elected leader of
Chile; The Gulf War; disagreement with every arms control proposal of any
kind; two-trillion dollars spent on armaments in six years with no war in
sight.
<p>
That was yesterday, but things haven't changed much today.  Recent reports say
that the pentagon will be issued more operating funds than it requests.
Already the military is planning ways to spend this extra booty.  How about a
giant blimp, a 1,485-foot craft that could get tanks to hot spots in a hurry as
reported by the <i>Jane's Defense Weekly</i>:  ``Using a fleet of
airships, each with a potential 50 ton lifting capacity, the Joint
Chiefs of Staff would be able to guarantee a fully capable military
response to any future act of aggression in days, rather than weeks.''
Of course when the military gets a new toy, it usually finds an excuse
to use it. But that's not all.  ``Star Wars'' may get a booster shot.
And how about the $493 million B-2 bomber!  How many more of these do
we need?  Undoubtedly there are more military schemes on the back
burner.  And our government talks about balancing the budget in seven
years?
<p>
How many American citizens have heard of <i>The School of the Americas</i>?
The U.S. Army school located in Fort Benning, Georgia?  This school is
sometimes known by other names, especially in Latin America:  School of the
Dictators, School of the Assassins, School of the Coup. Although it is located
only a short distance from CNN headquarters in Atlanta, it has had little TV
coverage, even though it qualifies for everything the media goes for:  terror,
shooting, killing...  This school, located on American soil, has trained the
likes of Guatemalan Col. Julio Alpirez, a CIA operative who was implicated in
two murder crimes recently; this school has trained Salvadoran mass murderer
Roberto D'Aubuisson; this school has trained many others of equal notoriety,
including General Manuel Antonio Noriega, whom we first trained and later
turned against.  If any other country maintained a school that promotes
terrorism--kidnappers, torturers and assassins--we would condemn it.  And
now, as stated in the October, 1995 issue of <i>National Geographic:</i> ``The
U.S. Army is sneaking up on the next century at Fort Benning, Georgia, as it
tests `smart gear' now being developed for combat.  ...Wired in, their weapon
sights and helmet-mounted video cameras capture images for transmission.
Ultimately, a network will link similarly outfitted infantry to tanks,
helicopters, and command posts, allowing rapid assessment of the battle, more
effective troop movement, and more accurate artillery targeting.''
<p>
While the  U.S. Congress plots to cut benefits for the poor, our government
keeps the  School of the Americas open with millions of taxpayer dollars
yearly.
<p>
And now how easy it is to learn to make a bomb. Check out the internet for
instructions, or books in the local library, or certain magazines.  Nothing to
it.  Some amateurs blow themselves up first but others, like the bombers of the
Federal Building in Oklahoma City and the New York Trade Center, or car
bombers, or bombers by mail, graduate to carry out successful devastation.
Lately there have been reports of pipe bombs being placed in rural mail boxes.
<p>
We teach them to kill in other ways besides preparing for war and making
bombs:  it's okay to kill wildlife in the name of sportsmanship; it's okay to
move into wildlife habitats and then kill that wildlife because it might eat us
or it becomes a nuisance; it's okay to move into the forest for privacy and
then kill the trees because they provide too much shade, or they shed their
foliage on our roof, or they feed our fireplace, or we can get big bucks for
them; it's okay to wipe out brush and trees that hold riverbanks together so we
can have a view; it's okay to clearcut the forests in the name of ``forest
management'' (the Forest Service's euphemism for profit) and in the process
bring about erosion, loss of top soil, rivers filled with silt and debris, and
dried-up streams where salmon used to spawn; it's okay to contaminate the
oceans with refuse and oil spills;  it's okay to over-fish the ocean and then
blame sea lions for the shortage of seafood--so let's cut down on the
population of the sea lions--, and now shark meat is considered a table
delicacy, the ocean's natural predator that helps keep the sea lion population
in balance; it's okay to drain wetlands to use for purposes other than for what
nature intended, endangering the bird population that frequents them; it's okay
to overgraze the land and kill off native grasses.  This is what we teach our
children instead of stressing the importance of ecological balance and
preservation of our natural resources. This is how we teach them to
inadvertently kill the future for their grandchildren.
<p>
Because of easy access to guns, killing for a living has become such an every
day occurrence, we've come to accept it.  Instead of getting to the source of
the problem, we try to solve it by barricading our houses; by demanding more
police on the beat; by building more jails to incarcerate the already deprived.
Until we close the tremendous gap between the rich and the poor, crime will
always be with us.  The late columnist, Sydney J. Harris, once wrote:  <i>``The
kind of prisons a society has, and the kind of persons it takes in and turns
out, reveal more about the essence of that society than any other of its
institutions.  We make and get the criminals we deserve.''</i>
<p>
The growing tolerance of killing takes hold in other frightening ways.
In America, often referred to as an armed camp, the citizens arm
themselves against intruders and street muggers. Some states pass laws
that allow people to obtain permits to carry concealed handguns.  Some
states try to make these laws mandatory.  Many of these ``right to
bear arms'' defenders of life and liberty do not realize that they
would have to have their gun in hand at all times to be ready for an
assault.  <i>(Now just wait a minute Mr. Burglar--just hold off until
I get my gun.  Let's see.  Where did I put it? But little children can
find it</i>.)  Even police officers know that being armed doesn't
always protect them if the assailant gets the jump on them, and the
police go through extensive training in learning how to defend
themselves.
<p>
Children are killing children and children are killing their parents and
children are killing their teachers with the guns their parents keep around for
protection.  These children must have learned that it is okay to kill from
somewhere. Many are too young to realize the consequences of their actions; the
actors they see killed in movies and TV shows always come back to
life.
<p>
<i>Thou shalt not kill</i>, the most profound of the Ten Commandments, is
too often ignored by even most of the professed religious in our midst.  The
U.S. militias sprouting up around the country to protect themselves from real
or imagined government abuses pack both guns and Bibles.  This is the
contradictory, violent atmosphere their children grow up in.  They learn to
hate and kill at an early age.
<p>
A report of new lessons in killing appeared in an article in
<cite>Newsweek, </cite> October 30, 1995 edition.<i> ``Women hunters
take to the wilderness, guns cocked and bows nocked.''</i> These new
hunters are ``retrofitting their rifles to accommodate their shorter
arms'', and many come ``equipped with drop-seat pants to accommodate
nature's call.''  Some female hunters consider the hunt ``a reverence
for nature and spend hours with their dead prey thinking about why it
was there, where it lived, what it was doing--a spiritual thing...''
<p>
Federal Cartridge Company deals out free bullets to these new hunters in a
plot to keep them hooked.
<p>
The Browning Corporation, which makes 12 kinds of sporting shotguns, began
selling lighter versions designed specifically for smaller arms and
hands.
<p>
State wildlife departments, which get the bulk of their revenues from
hunting and fishing licenses, see these new hunters as a ``way to
refill their coffers.''
<p>
Wilderness workshops designed to accommodate women hunters are run by state
fish and game departments with help from ammo makers.
<p>
Of course these new hunters are supported by The National Rifle Association
with free gifts.
<p>
And these new hunters are teaching their daughters how to ``match wits with
nature.''  (In all fairness why not throw down the gun and ``match instincts''
with nature and see who wins.)
<p>
One 14-year-old girl said that hunting was better than selling Girl Scout
Cookies.  A 13-year-old, who couldn't wait to shoot her first duck and mount it
at the foot of her bed, saw no harm in killing ducks ``because there were so
many of them.''
<p>
One female hunter compared butchering domestic animals for food with killing
wildlife for food. No difference. Ignored was the fact that our wildlife helps
to steady nature's intricate balance.
<p>
Another female hunter said she enjoyed eating meat more when she could shoot
it herself.
<p>
Instead of cutting down on the population of wildlife, the
proliferation of the human species should be curbed as it is the fastest
growing and most dangerous predator of all.
