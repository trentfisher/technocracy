How many times have we done something, perhaps based on false or
insufficient information, and said, ``Golly, I wish I hadn't done
that,'' or maybe, ``Well, I'll know better next time.'' Next time, of
course, we will be more informed and capable of making a better decision.
<p>
Our social system and its vast baggage of concepts, mores and folkways is the
product of many thousands of years of blundering along in ignorance,
superstition and misinformation, partly to protect the social status of those
in power, but primarily because people just didn't know any better.
<p>
Our present form of economy is based on the same elements. It was formulated
in the days when resources seemed limitless and humanity, having just tasted a
sample of proprietorship with the end of the feudal system in parts of Europe,
was experiencing the rudiments of the credo of the insatiable incentive system:
nothing is worth doing unless some gain (usually in the form of the acquisition
of goods) accrues to the doer. It was also formulated in the days of
ignorance.
<p>
Only in fairly recent times can we see the revelation of the grand-daddy
of all processes on earth and the rest of the universe: the Laws of
Thermodynamics.
<p>
When the Second Law of Thermodynamics was officially assigned the more
user-friendly moniker ``entropy'' in 1868, the United States was already on a
resource roll, fired by expansionist philosophy and an inexorable adoption of
resource-gobbling technology. The control mechanism of money that, fair or not,
allotted the benefits of technology to a select few and thereby limited
resource consumption, fell by the way when sales-hungry industry foisted the
miracle of installment buying on an otherwise empty-pursed working
population.
<p>
Only in 1933 when Howard Scott, late Director-In-Chief of Technocracy, defined
economics and a standard of living in terms of the rate of the degradation of
energy was the link between scientific principle and social welfare made a
matter of general public knowledge. The industrialists promptly suppressed it,
preferring to relegate scientists to their ivory towers to toil away in meek
servitude to their paychecks. In cloistered isolation they plied their esoteric
trades and kept their secrets, bribed with the good life and separated by
specialization, to insure competition between their employers for a corner on
the market and competition between themselves for prestige and grant
money.
<p>
Now the information age is upon us with a mind-boggling array of data that, in
our antediluvian mindset, we just can't absorb. Unfortunately, the very speed
of technology seems to be feeding upon itself, demanding more technology to
control it and placing us farther behind in our ability to grasp it. And the
thing that sticks most in our craw is that we can no longer operate with
business as usual by consuming resources as a means of accumulating piles of
intangible debt.
<p>
Entropy, simply put, states that in a closed system with limited resources, we
cannot keep converting them to usable forms forever. (Sorry, Limbaughites.) The
oil that is used to power turbines that generate electricity and appears to us
as heat and light from our reading lamp will never be usable as oil again (at
least not for a couple hundred million years, when the organic material that
makes up the reader becomes the oil.) When we replant an old-growth forest, the
trees will be of poorer quality. You can't copy a copy and have it come out as
good as the original.
<p>
The Law says that <strong>every bit of energy or resource we use, we
can get back in less usable form only.</strong> The earth does not pay
interest like a savings 
account; it depreciates in utility. Yet, strangely enough, we use an elastic
and intangible financial system based on a strange and frankly irrational melee
of philosophical concepts to control the development and distribution of
physical resources.
<p>
As Jeremy Rifkin states in his book, <cite>Entropy, A New World
View:</cite> ``Every
technology ever conceived by the genius of humankind is nothing more than a
transformer of energy from nature's storehouse. In the process of that
transformation, the energy flows through the human system where it is used for
a fleeting moment to sustain life (and the artifacts of life) in a
nonequilibrium state. At the other end of the flow, the energy eventually ends
up as dissipated waste, unavailable for future use.''
<p>
Rifkin continues: ``The next time a technician, politician, or businessman
tells you he or she can eliminate the secondary problems associated with a
particular program, product, or process with better planning or better
leadership or better design, think about the second law. It is true that the
secondary disorders caused by a particular technology can be temporarily solved
by the application of new technology. But the solution will inevitably result
in even greater disorders.'' In other words, step on the lump in the rug and it
pops up somewhere else. Use your other foot to step on the other one, and two
more pop up across the room.
<p>
And entropy doesn't affect just our degradable resources. We are currently
witnessing social entropy--the decline of relationships between people,
directly related to dwindling resource bases. Economics has always been the
primary basis for war and strife whether between two people competing for a job
or two nations competing for a resource. The social degradation in North
America and throughout the world stems from either a contrived or actual
shortage of resource distribution: in resource-rich areas, to increase trade
values and promote a social system based on inequity; in resource-poor areas,
due to ignorance, overpopulation and philosophical hangups.
<p>
Scientists have long known that we can't continue our present course but, as
Jerome Deshusses observes in <cite>The Eighth Night of Creation:</cite> ``The
scientific researcher is the perfect hireling.'' They have known for years that
money is not a resource but a matter of opinion, but they need their salaries.
Attempts have been made to make something scientific out of money by assigning
it mathematical properties. Mathematician Ted Thoren, in his <cite>The Truth In
Money Book</cite>, bravely attempts to demonstrate that money can be
explained in 
mathematical terms. In reality, nothing from nothing--or plus, times, minus,
divided by, cubed, squared, sliced, diced, or whatever--equals nothing. As far
as meeting physical needs, numbers are abstracts unless they are counting or
measuring something. And money has never done either.
<p>
Had we known about the Law of Entropy when we stumbled onto this Continent,
would we have handled things differently? What if we had based our
policy-making and distributive mechanism on hard, immutable fact rather than on
vague, imponderable concepts like freedom, democracy, the dignity of toil, and
the misguided notion that people must be incessantly and exponentially bribed
with sweetmeats to get them to do anything worthwhile (Price System
preservatives, one and all).
<p>
With the tremendous amount of knowledge at our disposal now, are we handling
things differently? Apparently not. To support our value system, born in
ignorance, we in North America continue to degrade energy as if there were no
tomorrow. And there may not be many more tomorrows, at least for Homo
sapiens.
<p>
Modern alchemists, breasting an overwhelming tide of fear and suspicion,
tinker with converting sows' ears into silk purses at a molecular level in a
mad scramble to synthesize new wonder compounds or replicate others--desperate
cyclists in a race against consumption, feverishly trying to shore up the
bicycle with untried parts as it collapses beneath them. Theorists talk of
abundant resources and ``free'' energy (remember nuclear power), little realizing
that the last thing business wants is anything free and abundant that can't be
hoarded by the strongest and doled out at tremendous profit.
<p>
Meanwhile, the ``right'' to consume massive quantities and the ensuing
degradation continues. The fat man gluts himself, depending on miracle diet
drugs untested for side effects, to burn off his fat cells so he may continue
to glut. The band plays on. Dorian Gray whirls in a madcap waltz of waste while
the portrait on the wall--the real essence of his being--falls into
decay.
<p>
The topsoil erodes. Nuclear wastes build up. Species disappear by the
hundreds. The landfills fill. The lofty mahoganies of the Amazon Basin,
accessible thanks to a new superhighway, topple beneath a tropospheric pall of
smoke. Bevis and Butthead stab each other with pencils and burn the
couch.
<p>
The buildup of the military machine escalates with no enemy in evidence except
our own inefficiency. Pollution, the byproduct of converted resources, is
everywhere. And the wealthy wall themselves off from the vast majority of the
world's population (expected to double by the year 2025) that lives just at or
below the most niggardly of subsistence levels.
<p>
And we all grow progressively dysfunctional, physically, mentally, or both,
because it's just too big and fast for us. The meek escape into the comforts of
less-complicated times (thereby creating another market for the consumption of
nostalgic bric-a-brac, log homes, and other collectibles), the aggressive
escape into streets and stadiums. And both retreat into the nostrums of alcohol
and drugs and remain perversely proud and protective of the part they play in
producing the consumer goods we will throw away, use to kill, or stuff
ourselves with. The most revered and heeded in matters of policy are the most
consumptive.
<p>
More often than not, we can't reclaim that goof or faux pas we made. We can
only learn from the experience and hope to use the knowledge to avoid making
the same mistakes.
<p>
Will we continue to blunder and plunder along? How many times will we murmur,
``Oops! Better not do that again.''? As for the future of humanity on this
planet, the Law of Entropy only allows so many ``Oopses.''
<p>
Our present way of thinking is the product of thousands of years of depleting
resources and moving on. The last century and a half of technological progress
has left us with little opportunity to further such adventurism. Scientists eye
celestial bodies with plans of mining them and erecting structures such as huge
solar panels. All this seems very remote in a social system that measures any
venture in potential dollar return and is beset by an endless array of problems
because of it. Unless we realign our method of governing resources and the
society dependent on them, respective of natural laws and based on the
distribution of a measured plenty to all citizens, the words of the next to the
last person on earth may very likely be, ``How much?'' and those of the last,
``Maybe we shouldn't have done that.''
