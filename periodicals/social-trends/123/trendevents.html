According to a report of 90 multinational corporations, European companies
provide more jobs for American workers than all other countries. The report by
the European-American Chamber of Commerce points out that about 2.9 million
Americans were employed by European affiliates or firms in the United States in
1990. American corporations with overseas affiliates employed about 2.8 million
European workers, or about as many workers as European companies do in the
U.S.
<p>
In all, 4,615 companies owned or partly owned by European multinationals
employed 2,880,600 American workers in the United States in 1990, or about 3
percent of the U.S. work force, with heavy concentration in food, chemical and
machinery industries.
<p>
Among the findings in the report:
<ul>
  <li>...European affiliates operating in the U.S. tend to hire
      skilled labor and pay 19 percent higher wages than American
      firms.
  <li>...European manufacturing affiliates employ 1.3 million workers
      and provide more than 7 percent of all U.S. manufacturing jobs.
</ul>
<p>
It is ironic that European multinational corporations with their affiliates in
the United States can afford to pay American workers in wages one-fifth more
money than those American companies that are operating in the U.S. It doesn't
say much for those American corporations whose management and CEO's are paid
many times more than the average and most skilled American worker. (The Crystal
Report reveals that CEO Sanford I. Weill was paid $50.7 million last year.)
While American workers have been making and continue to make all kinds of
concessions to American industries, the management and CEO's of the largest
corporations in the United States continue to receive all kinds of perks, stock
options and pensions upon retirement amounting to millions of dollars. In an
economic system where growth and expansion, and investments and maximizing
profits are foremost, American corporations and management have no qualms when
it comes to laying off thousands of workers, closing plants, moving or building
new plants in a foreign country where the labor is cheap, taxes are minimal or
don't exist, and there are few or no environmental or other
restrictions.
<p>
If the largest of U.S. corporations and industries cannot hold their own or
compete, wagewise or otherwise, in their own country, the idea of global
competitiveness has a hollow ring. For most Americans, economic equality has
been and will continue to be an illusion. But there is an alternative. Besides
implementing a balanced production-distribution mechanism, all the United
States needs to do is mobilize all of its resources and use its
scientific-engineering expertise to update and build its social and industrial
complex into a viable and harmonious operation (second to none in the world
today.)
