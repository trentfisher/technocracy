``The persistence with which the moulders of our public opinion in the
press keep reminding themselves and their public of the
fallaciousness, not to say the perniciousness, of the Technocratic
doctrines reminds one strongly of the little boy trying bravely to
keep up his courage in the dark by constantly reassuring himself, `I
ain't sk-keered.'  It seems that such a number of things tend to
remind the gentlemen of the press of something or other Technocracy
says that they find it quite impossible to pretend it into oblivion.
<P>
``We have, for example, the little matter of technological unemployment, which,
in spite of the application of the most potent of witchcraft by our very best
medicine men in an effort to conjure it out of existence, appears to
be with us yet.
<P>
``Lest there still be confusion on this point, let us review the
pertinent facts: Every piece of machinery introduced since the
beginning of the use of tools has resulted in some job or other
requiring fewer man-hours for its performance than was previously the
case. It was for that purpose that the tools were developed and
introduced in the first place. In the industrial growth of North
America, new tools and machines were introduced but slowly at
first. There came the steam engine, then steamships and
railroads. There was the cotton gin, the reaper, and better plows.
Man-hours were displaced in communication when the telegraph, and
later the telephone, superseded the pony express. Finally, during the
last 50 years, the whole works has blossomed forth into the finest and
most complex array of industrial equipment ever seen by the eyes of
man. And without exception each and every one of these developments
has resulted in the doing of the job in hand with fewer man-hours than
was ever before the case.''

(Excerpt from <cite>Some Facts Of Life</cite> in
Technocracy, Series A, No. 5, December, 1935, by M. King Hubbert.)
<P>
The American press continues to try to pretend Technocracy into
oblivion, but we are still here.
<P>
M. King Hubbert was a member of Technocracy Inc. from its inception
in the early 1930s as a non-profit, non-political research and educational
organization. He was one of the major contributors to the original
Technocracy Study Course book (first published in 1934) among the
members of the New York City Section, R.D. 7340, under the direction of
Howard Scott, founder and Director-in-Chief. Much of what Hubbert
contributed, especially the material on natural resources, has been
continued in the present <cite>Technocracy: Technological Social Design.</cite>
<P>
Hubbert wrote a number of articles in the official CHQ magazine,
Technocracy, in the 1930s, all of which are as valid today as then.
<P>
The most significant of these writings probably was <cite>Man-Hours --
A Declining Quantity</cite> (later expanded and
reprinted by Continental Headquarters as a booklet entitled
<a href="../../../pamphlets/man-hours-distribution.html">Man-Hours and
Distribution</a>).
<P>
By using simple mathematics and statistics, with plain logic, he
confirmed Technocracy's critical analysis of the inherent inability
of the fundamental rules-of-the-game of our present system--everything
for a price--to sustain monetary purchasing power in the face of
advancing technological power, that is, forcing the system to turn to
massive debts and/or foreign wars. This one article disproved the
primary premises of economists that human labor's man-hours could
continue indefinitely as the source of Price System purchasing power
in technological North America.
<P>
In his later years, Hubbert lectured at colleges and universities
in the United States and Canada on the vital importance of conserving
our remaining Continental resources of non-renewable minerals--especially
petroleum and gas--, on the impossibility of continued ``growth'' as
proclaimed by economists, businessmen, and politicians, and on the great
potentials of renewable energy, especially direct solar energy,
hydropower, tidal power, geothermal, all parallel to Technocracy's
concepts.
<P>
In a ``Letter to Members'' from the National Academy of Sciences,
Volume 19--Number 4, April 1990, M. King Hubbert was given this tribute:
<p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The Council of the National Academy of Sciences, meeting on December
15, 1989, expressed the sorrow of the membership at the death of
M. King Hubbert on October 11, 1989, at the age of 86.
<P>
Although most renowned for having predicted an oil shortage some 20
years before it actually occurred, Marion King Hubbert's major
contribution to science was his application of physics to geological
processes. He dealt with the mechanics of geologic structures; the
physics of underground fluids (applying model theory in detail to
tectonic problems and producing penetrating analyses of the dynamics
of fluids moving through porous media); and the earth's mineral
resources and their significance in human affairs. ``Eminently
theoretical,'' as he described it, his work yet had eminently
practical implications: drastic societal reforms to conserve mineral
resources and changes in foreign policy toward the oil-producing
nations. In ground-water hydrology and petroleum geology, it opened up
whole new fields.
<P>
Born October 5th, 1903, in San Saba, Texas, King Hubbert took his
B.S. (1926), M.S. (1928), and Ph. D. (1937) degrees at The University
of Chicago, where he studied not only geology, but also physics and
mathematics. For a year and a half he also worked as an assistant
geologist for Amerada Petroleum Company, spending his summers
exploring for minerals with the Illinois State and US Geological
Surveys. As senior analyst with the Board of Economic Warfare in
Washington from 1942-1943, he conducted some of his first
mineral-resource studies.
<P>
He worked for Shell Oil and Shell Development Companies in Houston
over the next 20 years--first as a research geophysicist, then
associate director of exploration and production research, and finally
as chief consultant in general geology. Leaving Shell in 1963, he
became, jointly, a research geologist with the US Geological Survey
and professor of geology and geophysics at Stanford. Five years later,
however, he left Stanford and was induced to return to academia only
in 1973, when he was appointed California Regents' professor at
Berkeley. Retiring from academia for good in 1976, he remained active
with the US Geological Survey, his longstanding disagreement with
their inflated resource estimates notwithstanding.
<P>
In February 1975, when America was laboring under an oil shortage that
took most of the country by surprise, a National Academy of Sciences
report confirmed the Academy's acceptance of King Hubbert's
calculations on the rate and extent of oil and natural gas depletion
and its rejection of more optimistic estimates. ``A child born in the
middle 30s,'' Hubbert told reporters, ``will have seen the consumption
of 80 percent of all American oil and gas in his lifetime; a child
born about 1970 will see most of the world's [reserves] consumed.''
<P>
King Hubbert first came to these unpopular conclusions in 1949, when
the earth's wealth seemed limitless and predictions of doom could be
easily ignored. But by 1956 he had mathematical proof: a formula (that
resulted in a curve known as ``Hubbert's Pimple'') that could be used
to plot consumption rate and remaining reserves of any exhaustible
resource. His conclusion that ever-escalating oil production would
peak in 1966 (or, given larger reserves, in 1971) then fall off
rapidly as reserves dwindled, shocked the oil companies and the
American Petroleum Institute.
<P>
``Growth, growth, growth, that's all we've known,'' he said in
1975. ``World automobile production is doubling every ten years; human
population growth is like nothing that has happened in all of geologic
history. The world will only tolerate so many doublings of
anything--whether it's power plants or grasshoppers.''
<P>
Despite ever larger estimates of the country's untapped oil reserves
(culminating in the US Geological Survey's 1961 figure of 590 billion
barrels!), evidence from the field consistently followed his predicted
curve, confirming his modest 150-200 billion barrel estimate. Yet,
rather than importing and storing foreign oil as he advised in his
1958 report, the federal government embarked on a larger interstate
highway program. In 1962, King Hubbert authored a 150-page energy
section in the Academy's natural resources study submitted to
President Kennedy, but his recommendations (since proved accurate but
toned down in the executive summary) were once again ignored. Another
warning in 1967 also went unheeded, and it was not until 1973 that
both the public and government agencies began to take note.
<P>
But if public officials responded slowly to King Hubbert's message, he
was much honored by his fellow scientists. Elected to the Academy in
1955 and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1957, he
received the Geological Society of America's Arthur L. Day Medal two
years later and became the body's president in 1962. In 1977 he
received the Rockefeller Public Service Award.
<P>
``It is... the clearest mark of Hubbert's work,'' said C.B. Raleigh in
1981 when Columbia University presented him with its prestigious
Vetlesen Prize, ``that the mechanical principles involved were laid
down so clearly and elegantly [in Hubbert and Rubey's (NAS-dec.) 1959
treatment of mountain-building and overthrust faulting].  When the
seminar was over, we had received a thorough education in some aspects
of classical mechanics in addition to the geological evidence needed
to make the case for their hypothesis.''
<P>
The author of more than 70 journal articles and several books on
ground water, structural geology, and energy resources, King Hubbert
was also an excellent speaker and spent 1973-1974 lecturing on ``The
World's Energy Economy'' throughout the United States and Canada. As a
scientist he applied rigorous physical reasoning to the study of
complex geological phenomena, bringing many apparently paradoxical
observations regarding earth fluids into conformity with potential
theory. As a principled citizen of the world he was courageously
outspoken, defying conventional wisdom to inform government, business,
and the public regarding the need for natural resources
conservation. He will be greatly missed.
<P>
We resolve in the minutes of this meeting that we were fortunate to
have known M. King Hubbert and to have counted him a member of our
Academy fellowship for 34 years. We further resolve that a copy of
this resolution be presented to Miriam Hubbert as a symbol of our
sympathy and very great regard.
</blockquote>
<P>
The work that M. King Hubbert did in his 1930's writing for
Technocracy was so important in supplementing the core concepts that
they are salient enough for him to be remembered and recognized by
every Technocrat.
