We live in a country that can produce goods and
services in such large quantities that the most common problem
faced by our industries is how to find new markets.  Only in the
rarest cases do shortages appear.  Everything a person could
want materially is available.  If it is true that we can produce
more than enough for everyone, then why doesn't everyone have
more than enough?
<p>
The complex answer to this seemingly simple question lies in the
very nature of our system of economic organization, the Price
System, and in the direction of social motion it is forced into
by the advance of technology.  The Price System was devised
about 7000 years ago as a means for distributing a scarcity.
The invention was both simple and brilliant.  If you don't have
enough money, you can't buy it.  However, the system continues
to operate this way even if no scarcity exists.
<p>
One need look no further than U.S. agriculture to find an
outstanding example of the desperate lengths to which the system
will go to maintain the price and just how futile those attempts
are.  Despite a never ending variety of government subsidy
programs, farm population continues to decline and the price of
farm produce is so low that many farmers must work on a second
job in the city to support their farms.  It is the social system
itself that demands an inadequate supply of everything.  Within
these confines the distribution of goods and services is a
matter for the society in question.  Most of the wealth can be
concentrated in a few hands or it can be distributed more
equitably among the society's members.  The fact is the Price
System dictates that a certain fraction of the population
resigns itself to poverty.
<p>
What kinds of people are poor and what kinds of situations seem
to contribute to poverty?  In 1969, 10% of the population of the
U.S. were poor, 22% of families with seven or more members were
poor, 28% of black families were poor, and 32% of female-headed
families were poor.  If more than one characteristic at a time
is considered, 53% of black female-headed families with seven or
more members were poor.  In 1983 the poverty level climbed to
15.2% in the U.S., the highest level since 1965.  The Census
Bureau reported that the largest contributing factor was a rise
in female-headed households.
<p>
The elderly persons who are long past retirement form one of the
most rapidly increasing groups today.  Since 1900 the average
life expectancy has increased more than 50%, from 49 to almost
75 today.  A recent article in <cite>The Wall Street Journal
</cite>commented on the inevitable financial strains this
increase will produce.  Other recent articles point to a
shrinking middle class due to rapid technological advance and
shifting employment patterns.
<p>
Employment in a service economy appears headed for a two-tier
structure consisting of relatively few highly paid, highly
educated professionals and armies of low-paid, low-skilled
workers.  The availability of a job is no guarantee of freedom
from poverty.
<p>
Both sides appear to be losing the war between the sexes as 40%
of the adults in the U.S. are single.  A large percentage of
today's children are being raised in day-care centers.  The
sociological impact of this has as yet to be measured.  The
society now contains many whose low genetic endowment, low level
of motivation and neurotic behavior leave them qualified for
only the most menial of tasks.
<p>
No matter what analysis is done or how many statistics are
collected, it is obvious that as automation in the industrial
and service sectors proceeds, many more people will be forced
into either low-paying jobs or unemployment.  The Price System
demands that people be gainfully employed in order to obtain a
wage.  The amount of that wage is determined by the number of
people capable of doing a particular type of work and the demand
for it.  Those who are supported by public assistance without
working receive their income by taxation of those who are
employed.  Floating debt in ever increasing amounts to maintain
a sinking system is not a viable solution.  The financial
markets are reacting with growing horror to never ending debt
growth.
<p>
How the books balance on the supply and demand of unnecessary
misery is exclusively a function of how long the people of North
America decide it should go on.  The rate of social change is
governed by the amount of misery the continued operation of the
system causes.  The continued operation of the system depends
not only upon its level of unworkability but also upon the
availability of a reasonable alternative.
<p>
Technocracy Inc. offers the only plan for this operation of a
high-energy civilization.  If the Price System is collapsing, we
will have to do without it.  Technocracy Inc. offers the Energy
Certificate, a method of Continent-wide accounting of the energy
consumed in the production of goods and services.  This would
permit continuous monitoring of the industrial processes and
insure their smooth, efficient functioning.  The only function
of such a system would be to provide people with what they want.
Material goods would cease to have any value other than what
they could be used for by whoever wanted them.  Poverty would
disappear.  Differences between people would no longer be
measured in terms of lifeless possessions.  The only way a
person could distinguish himself from others would be by
becoming genuinely outstanding in a particular skill useful to
others.
<p>
Technocracy is not an attempt to design a utopia.  There are no
guarantees for happiness.  Technocracy does not attempt to fill
in all the blanks or answer all questions that might arise as
situations and problems that may appear in the future can not be
predicted.  Technocracy has provided the framework to build the
next stage of human civilization.  But the transition will not
occur automatically.  A citizenry informed about what is
happening is required.  This is the function of Technocracy.
Those persons who wish to be in the forefront of the greatest
social change the human race has ever seen will find
Technocracy's social design for the North American Continent
irresistible.
