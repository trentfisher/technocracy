An examination of social and economic conditions reveals a
surprising conclusion:  Here at home <strong>everyone is on some
kind of welfare, either directly or indirectly, and those who
benefit indirectly are totally dependent upon their benefits
being validated by those who get some kind of welfare directly.
</strong>If those receiving direct benefits were to have them
curtailed or cut off completely, then those enjoying indirect
benefits would find theirs reduced in corresponding amounts.
<p>
According to recent reports, there are 963 current social
programs in the U.S. where some 80 million people receive direct
benefits or services from the government.  For instance, in l983
farmers reportedly received $9.3 billion in subsidies, more than
double the previous high of $3.96 billion in 1972.  All states
participated in the benefits with individual farmers receiving
an average of $3,922 each in 1983.  Added to this are all the
other welfare programs such as food stamps, educational grants,
tax credits and shelters for high-income brackets, business
bailouts, social programs for the elderly and disabled, and the
list goes on.  Without the above-referenced government programs,
the millions who benefit from them would not have enough money--
or purchasing power--to absorb even a small part of the goods
and services our high technology is capable of producing.  This
is just another way our government attempts to stimulate our
lagging purchasing power.
<p>
These billions of dollars of debt creation pumped into the
economy in the form of various kinds of welfare programs
represent income for the rest of the population indirectly.
Without Price System welfare, the entire economy would collapse.
There would not be enough purchasing power left to maintain
those who think they earn their living by the sweat of their
brow.  If one calculates the amount of nonrenewable energy it
takes to support one individual during his lifetime, no one can
"earn his keep" in a high-energy, high technology complex that
is the North American Continent today.
<p>
Rather than point a finger at welfare recipients, we should
direct our efforts to applying a technological solution to a
technological problem.  We need to adopt a technique of
measurement and equal distribution of the fruits of our
technology.
<p>
For those who think that the wealthy are not dependent on the
purchasing power given to those on various welfare programs--
that the wealthy would get by with or without them--, take
another look!  Government creates debt in order to create
purchasing power in order to stimulate the busines economy.
Without this financial merry-go-round, money itself would soon
become worthless and there would be no more income for anyone
until such time that a non-Price System was installed.
<p>
Huge deficits created by necessary government spending and the
continuous growth of the total public and private debt (now $6.4
trillion) will inevitably result in national bankruptcy.  The
present attempt to cut spending--even the rate of spending--if
seriously pursued will result in national bankruptcy also, only
it will happen much sooner.
<p>
We are fighting with the ridiculous, the impossible dream in
attempting to fit a technological society that is capable of
producing a sufficient amount of goods and services for all
citizens into one of enforced scarcity and monumental debt.
This monetary yoke confronting North American citizens and their
offspring presents a bleak future.
<p>
Is this what we want?  A Continent of welfare recipients?
Unless we learn to accept the technological change that is here
now and help to install a new system that is compatible with our
technology and resources, we can look forward to complete
chaos--the collapse of our social system.
