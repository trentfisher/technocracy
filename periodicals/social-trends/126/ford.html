<hr>
<p>
This is the story of the Ford empire and how it fought on both sides
in World War II, helping to kill indiscriminately hundreds of
thousands of Americans as well as Germans for profit.
<p>
It is not the story of villainy of any one man or any one corporation.
For the Ford empire broke no laws devised by man in anything it did;
and when the whole story of American--and British and German and
French--big business is fully revealed, it will probably be found that
the Ford empire acted no worse than other economic empires, and quite
possibly better than some.
<p>
So this is rather an indictment of a system than of a single
corporation&#151;a <b>laissez faire </b>system in which the motives of
profit and property, export-import balances and annual net earnings
control.  And it is a system that must be re-evaluated, not alone in
the light of what happened in Europe during World War II, but also of
what has happened since and what will continue to happen as long as
there is a market for arms.
<p>
The Ford empire's dual role in the war, and particularly in the
critical years immediately preceding the war, which for Hitler were
the years of preparation, was achieved through its ownership of 52
percent of the stock of the Ford-Werke A.G. of Cologne, Germany, and
through the presence on Ford-Werke's board of directors, until Pearl
Harbor, of the late Edsel B. Ford, then president of the Ford Motor
Co. of Dearborn, and Charles E. Sorenson, then vice-president of Ford
and later president of Willys-Overland Motors.
<p>
Undoubtedly both Edsel Ford and Sorenson always considered themselves
good American patriots and, as such, bitter enemies of Hitler and all
that Hitler stood for.  Yet they were representatives of the American
majority ownership of Ford-Werke and members of the &quot;German&quot;
firm's board  of directors when the company management did these
things:
<ol>
  <li>Approved barter deals between Ford-Werke and Ford
      Co. of Dearborn, negotiated first in 1937 and repeated in 1938
      and 1939, which put precious stocks of American rubber and
      non-ferrous metals at the disposal of Hitler's growing war
      machine.
  <li>Approved contracts, prior to Pearl Harbor, between
      Ford-Werke and Hitler's government which, by 1942, resulted in
      the manufacture by the former of 100,000 to 120,000 of the total
      of 350,000 trucks that the Wehrmacht had at its disposal in that
      year.
  <li>Approved a special contract under which Ford-Werke
      arranged to produce vehicles of a strictly military nature for
      the Wehrmacht in a new plant built, in accordance with Wehrmacht
      demands,  in the &quot;safe&quot; zone of Berlin.
  <li>Approved in April, 1939, after six years of Hitlerism
      in Germany and but four months before the attack on Poland, a
      gift of 50,000 Reichsmarks to Hitler on the occasion of the
      Fuehrer's 50th birthday.
  <li>Approved publication by Ford-Werke of a house organ
      that persistently sang Hitler's praises and boasted of
      Ford-Werke's role in Nazi Germany's war production.
  <li>Approved a general policy that put the Ford empire's
      technical &quot;know-how&quot; and its international sales
      service behind Ford-Werke, enabling the German subsidiary to
      increase its exports and thus save precious foreign exchange for
      Hitler and his financial wizard, Hjalmar Schacht.
</ol>
<p>
These are the salient features of the Ford empire's international
history in the years immediately preceding U.S. entry into the war.
Shortly after Pearl Harbor, the Nazi alien property custodian formally
took over Ford-Werke, the American members of the board of directors
were ousted and Robert Schmidt, the man who had been the firm's
general manager under American ownership became its administrative
custodian under Hitler law.
<p>
But while all formal relationship between the Ford Co. of Cologne and
the Ford Co. of Dearborn was thus severed, the German plants built
with U.S. funds and operated by men instilled with American
&quot;know-how&quot; continued to:
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Build 15 to 20 per cent of all the mobile units of all
      kinds built for the Wehrmacht in the course of the war.
  <li>Produce motors and gears for Junkers and other
      aircraft;
  <li>Produce at least 10,000 half-tracks for the German
      army;
  <li>Play an immensely important role in the Wehrmacht
      repair shop program that sent back into battle time and time
      again motor units damaged by U.S. gunfire and bombing
      raids;
  <li>Control and operate secretly a Cologne plant known as
      Arendt G.M.B.H., which in peacetime had manufactured Ford parts,
      as a 100 percent munitions and armaments plant under direct
      arrangement with the High Command of the Wehrmacht.
</ul>
<p>
Thus did Ford Co. genius transcend national boundaries, extending its
beneficent influence all the way from Willow Run and River Rouge to
the Rhine; and if a grateful U.S. Army and U.S. Navy awarded banners
to the Ford Co. of Dearborn for its share in the production of the
B-24 and the jeep, so also had Hitler and the Wehrmacht reason to be
grateful to the Ford Co. of Cologne, second largest producer in all
Germany (second only to Opel, a General Motors subsidiary) of trucks
for the German army.
<p>
The Ford Company's history in Germany properly begins in 1926, when a
100 percent American-owned assembly factory was started in Berlin for
the building of Ford cars from American-made parts.  In 1929 Ford
Motor Co. A.G., as the German Ford Company was then known, was
reorganized and expanded, with British Ford Co.  (Ford Motor Co. Ltd.,
Dagenham) taking over 60 percent of the stock and the rest sold to
selected German purchasers (including I.G. Farben, which bought up 15
percent of the shares).
<p>
Two factors changed this setup.  One was increasinag German
nationalism, which fostered the slogan &quot;Buy German&quot;; the
second was the depression, which in Europe hit its peak between 1931
and 1934.  The German Ford Co. satisfactorily solved both challenges
by the end of the '30s.  It answered the &quot;Buy German&quot; slogan
by building a <u>factory in Cologne and by manufacturing as many
as</u> possible of its own parts out of German raw materials.  It
answered the challenge of the depression by again reorganizing with
the Ford Co. of Dearborn, reassuming majority ownership and throwing
the full weight of its production technique and magnificent worldwide
sales force behind the new German company.
<p>
But in 1933 Hitler had come into power and inaugurated a war economy
that posed a whole new set of problems.  Hitler would no longer permit
German industrial firms to pay for imports with money; he wanted
simultaneously to save foreign exchange and he wanted to have a voice
in what was imported so that he could be sure such imports would serve
his preparations for war.
<p>
In other words, the German Ford Co. was in the position of having to
export cars and parts in order to obtain the materials needed to build
more cars and more parts.  A glimpse into how this was achieved is
given in the 1935 annual report of the German Ford Co.:

<blockquote>
``... Our company has also taken considerable and active interest in
that very important task of German industry, namely the development of
foreign credit.  Our exports increased in 1935 to approximately
1,280,000 RM and we hope to be able to increase this amount
considerably in 1936.  In this connection it must be remembered that,
owing to the special comercial relations our company has with an
enterprise spread all over the world, we are in a different position
concerning export matters than factories working exclusively in
Germany.  In order to help German economic interests, a number of
other Ford Companies, especially the American and the English
companies, have placed orders for industrial products in Germany.''
</blockquote>

<p>
It goes without saying that the Ford Co. of Dearborn knew of this
report, and as intelligent businessmen could read in it at least as
much as you and I can read in it:  to wit, an avowed declaration on
the part of the German Ford Co. that it was working not only for
itself and its German and American stockholders, but also quite openly
for German national economy, which meant Hitler's economy, which meant
for a war economy.
<p>
But this did not scare Ford Co. of Dearborn.  The Emperors of the
River Rouge and the Rhine watched Hitler break provision after
provision of the Versailles treaty, watched him march into the
Rhineland, into the Saar, into Austria, yes, even into
Czecholslovakia--and continued to supply him with the export market he
needed desperately, and the imports he needed even more.
<p>
<a name="part2"> </a>
<p>
The key products needed by German Ford Co. were rubber and nonferrous
metals.  They were also key products needed by Hitler.  So Hitler
clamped down on their use by foreign-owned automobile companies such
as the Ford Co., which were still at the time turning out pleasure
cars.  The result, as Hitler must have known, was a mathematical
certainty.  German Ford Co. (this was in 1936) cabled frantically to
Edsel Ford and Sorenson in Dearborn:  &quot;<i>Purchase of tires in
Germany...is now entirely impossible...&quot;</i>  And the cable went
on to describe the situation as &quot;<i>catastrophic.</i>&quot;
<p>
Two representatives of the German Ford Co. followed the cable to
Dearborn.  The representatives sat down with Dearborn executives.  The
result was the first of the barter deals--that for 1937.  Under its
terms, Ford Co. of Dearborn undertook to supply rubber and other
material (cotton, soot, etc.) to German tire manufacturers, and to
accept in exchange cars and parts (particularly wheels, bearings and
speedometers) produced by German Ford Co.
<p>
Ford Co. of Dearborn did not sell these German Ford Co. products on
the American market but had them shipped directly to its foreign
markets, mostly in Latin America.  And meanwhile, back in Germany,
Hitler gleefully watched raw rubber and cotton and soot unloaded for
German Ford Co. at Hamburg and Bremen and other ports and snatched 30
percent of it for his own use--which meant that it was put at the
disposal of the exclusively war-minded Nazi Ministry of Economics.
<p>
In 1938 this barter deal was repeated and extended to cover pig iron
and nonferrous metals, again with special consent of the Nazi
economics  ministry, which this time exacted for its own disposition
not only 30 percent of the rubber but also 20 percent of the pig iron.
And this 1938 deal was substantially repeated in 1939.
<p>
The special contract under which German Ford Co. undertook to
manufacture a special type of military car--command cars or troop
carriers--for the High Command was signed in 1938, after Sorenson
visited Germany.  The contract was not signed without difficulty.  It
took three years to negotiate and involved a series of cables to and
from  Dearborn and visits of German Ford Co. men to the U.S.A. and of
Dearborn Ford Co. men to Germany.
<p>
The records show that German Ford Co. was anxious for the contract,
not alone for the profits involved but in order to obtain the goodwill
of the German High Command, which had apparently first broached the
subject of building a special military car.  The records also show
that Ford Co. of Dearborn was hesitant and vacillating.  In the first
place, the contract involved creation of a new factory in what was
then considered by the German High Command as the absolutely safe
Berlin zone--safe, that is, from all possible bombing raids.
<p>
But agreement was finally reached upon Sorenson's arrival in Germany
in April, 1938, and production of the military car began in 1939 in a
Berlin factory.  Due to lack of material and frequent changes and
ultimate abandonment of the design, the factory produced only 1100
military vehicles of the type originally intended, although it also
was used for a while to produce Luftwaffe items and spare parts for
the Cologne factory.
<p>
The factory was closed down in 1942, after the Wehrmacht's successes
in the west seemed to have rendered Cologne forever safe from attack.
But copies of the contract, which show American Ford Co.'s willingness
to have the German Ford Co. produce military cars specifically
designed by Hitler's High Command, still exist.
<p>
Shortly after the outbreak of the war  (but before Hitler's
declaration of war against the U.S.A.) Heinrich F. Albert, then
chairman of the board of the Ford Co.'s German subsidiary, Ford Werke
A.G., prepared a memorandum defending American majority ownership of
the firm as in interests of German national economy.  Below are the
cogent paragraphs of Albert's memorandum, which should make clear the
need for control and regulation of international big business:
<blockquote>
<p>
``In the past seven years, Ford-Werke A.G. has been transformed into a
Germany company to an increasing extent.  Not only are all vehicles
and parts produced in Germany, but German workers using German
materials under German direction are producing them...
<p>
``In this connection, all needed foreign raw materials were obtained
through the American Company (rubber, nonferrous metals) to cover not
only the production needs of the German plant, but in part for the
whole industry.
<p>
``Already during the peace, American influence has been more or less
converted into support for the German plant.  At the outbreak of war,
Ford-Werke A.G. placed itself immediately at the disposal of the armed
forces for armament purposes.
<p>
``Among the reasons that argue against complete Germanization of
Ford-Werke's capital, the primary one is the excellent sales
organization that, thanks to its connection with the American company,
is at the disposal of Ford-Werke A.G.  According to their productive
capacity, the German plants can export to all countries of the world,
and in this they are protected and supported in the matter of pricing
by the American company.  In some countries this has led to making
possible the German export of German Ford cars, even where the  rest
of the German industry was unable to find solid footing.  This limits
or keeps away purely American competition to some extent.
<p>
``As long as Ford-Werke A.G. has an American majority, it will be
possible to bring the remaining European Ford companies under German
influence, and thus to execute the greater European policy in this
field, too.  As soon as the American majority is eliminated, each Ford
company in every country will fight for its individual existence.  The
just now successfully accomplished joining of the potentiality of the
non-German European companies to the potentiality of Ford-Werke A.G.,
and with this to the general war potentiality of Germany, would thus
collapse more or less by itself.
<p>``
A majority holding, even if it is only a small one, by the Americans
is essential for the--actually free--transmission of the newest
American models as well as for the insight into American production
and sales methods.  Since Americans are without doubt particularly
progressive in the field, the maintenance of this connection is in the
German interest.  This cannot be accomplished merely through license
fees or contractual stipulations.  With the abolition of the American
majority, this advantage as well as the importance to the company for
the obtaining of raw materials and exports would be lost.  The plant
would practically be worth only its own machine capacity.''
</blockquote>
<p>
Thus the story of the Ford empire and World War II.  It is, in
essence, neither a new story nor a unique story.  It is, indeed, too
old and too familiar for comfort.  It is in itself an echo of the
story of other industrial giants who played both sides of the fence
before and during World Wars I and II.  And it undoubtedly will be
echoed in time.
<p>
We learned much after 1918--and did nothing.

recently and the tragic landing on Normandy Beach where  American
casualties ran high.  Old patriotic war movies were revived.  Nothing
was said about the corporations that carried on <b><i>business as
usual</i></b> at the expense of their own countrymen's lives and
mutilation.   How many times has it been said that &quot;remove the
profit, and we wouldn't have wars&quot;, and still the next generation
and the next march patriotically off to war. TECHNOCRACY:  An exciting
