``I believe in adequate defense of the coast and nothing else.  If
a nation comes over to fight, then fight.  The trouble is that when
American dollars earn only 6 percent over here, they get restless and
go overseas to get 100 percent.  The flag follows the dollar and the
soldiers follow the flag.  I wouldn't go to war again as I have done
to defend some lousy investment of the bankers.  We should fight only
for the defense of our home and the Bill of Rights.  War for any other
reason is simply a racket.
<p>
``There isn't a trick in the racketeering bag that the military
gang is blind to.  It had its `finger men' to point out enemies, its
`muscle men' to destroy enemies, its `brain men' to plan war
preparations and a `Big Boss'--supernationalistic capitalism.
<p>
``I spent 33 years and 4 months in active military service in the
Marines.  I helped make Tampico, Mexico safe for the American oil
interests in 1914; Cuba and Haiti safe for the National City Bank boys
to collect revenue;  helped purify Nicaragua for the International
banking house of Baron Broches in 1909-1912; helped save the
sugar interests in the Dominican Republic; and in China helped to see
that Standard Oil went its way unmolested.  <b><i>War is a
racket.</i></b>''
