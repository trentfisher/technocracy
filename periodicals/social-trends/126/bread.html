In the early part of the last century, our grandparents were taught
that the world was made about 4004 b.c., as that was the date
determined by a Bishop Usher who had counted the generations from the
first man, Adam, to the birth of Christ!  In the famous Scopes
(evolution) trial in the 20s, the well-known orator/lawyer, William
Jennings Bryan, vehemently defended the beliefs expounded by the
bishop.  The opposing lawyer was Clarence Darrow, who cited Darwin's
discoveries; much to the dismay of the fundamentalists, the young
biology teacher was given only a light fine.  His students celebrated.
Many ancient beliefs still affect society; some may be genetically
inherited, but most remain in our modern methods of communication: our
languages, the (commercial) media, and electronic.  Let's take a quick
look at the history of languages.
<p>
When the primitive man slew a mammoth, he immortalized the deed with a
sharp piece of flint on the walls of his cave that others might know
of it.  Picture writing by the ancient Egyptians was not only
scratched on walls but inked on parchment--the dried skin of sheep,
goats or lambs).  The crude, but identifiable symbols were organized
on lines.  Cuneiform was developed by the Assyrians, Babylonians and
Persians to make many words out of the same simple wedge-shaped marks.
The Greeks, however, created an alphabet of 24 characters from which
thousands of words could be made.  Alpha, Beta,....you see how easy it
is to make words!
<p>
Languages themselves are constantly dynamic, depending mainly on the
mobility of people due to simple technology.  The ancient Greek
population covered dozens of islands without sufficient arable land.
They traded with mainlanders for crops, using sailboats as did other
Mediterranean countries.  Remnants of languages were exchanged
particularly due to the universal practice of slavery.
<p>
The Roman Legions not only raided their neighbors in Italy but
throughout &quot;Mare Nostrum&quot; (our sea, the Mediterranean) and a
large part of Europe, including Britain.  The principal booty brought
back to Rome by the triumphant legions was thousands of slaves; the
most desirable were chosen by the emperors and their cohorts.  Sturdy
slaves became field workers; rebellious ones were sent to the triremes
(warships with three banks of oars) or the coliseum to combat with
wild animals for the entertainment of the populace.
<p>
There are many similarities between Roman society and ours.  The free
population of Rome contained two elements:  patricians and plebeians.
The former enjoyed all political privileges; the latter were
underprivileged, perhaps from other countries and races.  Some placed
themselves under protection of rich clans or <u>the government
itself</u>!  The patrician class dominated the government and were
mostly property owners.  The classes were seated separately at the
circuses in the coliseum.  Wild animals were brought from Africa for
various events.  In vicious violence some could only be surpassed by
modern television!  Criminals and people of other religions were main
events.
<p>
The Roman satirist/poet Juvenal (a patrician!) hated not only tyranny,
the vice and cruelty of his age, but its extravagant luxury, art,
poetry and even philosophy!  He saw the people numbed by ignorance and
indifference, kept in acquiescence by &quot;<i>panem et
circenses.</i>&quot;
<p>
Throughout the centuries, historians rarely condemned the depredations
of the Roman legions for their brutality.  The acceptance of tribal
rivalry and political boundary lines resulted from an indoctrinated
belief in &quot;the divine right of kings&quot;.  Our docile
toleration of increasing social evils in our status quo stems from the
repetitive inculcation of the patriotism of politics in our
schoolbooks and various media.  (Remember Pavlov's dogs?)  Behavior
patterns for thousands of years have been imposed by politics and
sanctified by religions, and serious consequences resulted from
non-observance.
<p>
For centuries churches attempted to indoctrinate morality with
orthodox religious beliefs.  In hundreds of towns, they were the
centers of community activity.  Today the masses of people attend ball
games.  The franchises for commercial sports teams run into hundreds
of millions of dollars. The sports world is no longer limited to
college competition.  Prize fights, once bare-knuckled affairs, are
also money dominated, as are track and racing events.  The behavior of
coliseum crowds is fascinating; they are vicariously involved with the
contestants; many experience orgasmic enthusiasm.  Just like the
ancient Romans!
<p>
The sophistry of our venal politicians assuages the doubts of most of
our citizens concerning our economy to restore confidence in our fiat
money by increasing government spending (and debt creation).  This is
the <u>bread</u> in the bread and circuses nostrum to postpone
fundamental social change.
<p>
Today we all play  &quot;money games&quot;; our &quot;leaders&quot;
protect the status quo.  We build coliseums and go into debt.
<p>
Investigate Technocracy, an exciting new idea for the social operation
of North America by technology under the direction of science.
