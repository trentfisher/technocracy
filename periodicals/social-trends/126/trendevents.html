<i><b>City That Lives By Car Has Nowhere To Go.</b></i>
<p>
The earthquake in the Los Angeles area brought out how vulnerable a
city could be that depends on the automobile and the consumption of
oil for transportation and as a mainstay in the operation of its
economy.  In an attempt to alleviate the ever increasing traffic
congestion, more roads and freeways are built, requiring more and more
of the land area, and bringing about greater dislocation.  This
insidious approach to the problem can only lead to a dead end.
<p>
When the freeways of the Los Angeles environs came tumbling down,
buckled or collapsed, leaving thousands of everyday working commuters
and vehicles stranded with nowhere to go, it brought home to millions
of people residing in the area how vulnerable and dependent the cities
of the region have become on the combustion engine.
<p>
Even without the disaster of an earthquake&#151;and there will be more
to come&#151;the entrenched hodge-podge design of the highway system
has been reaching a point where the average speed on the streets and
freeways is only 20 mph, and where traffic continues to stop and crawl
bumper to bumper for long periods of time during peak periods.
Constant maintenance and construction only adds to the delays and
congestion of traffic.
<p>
Los Angeles and the surrounding towns and cities grew in a topsy-turvy
manner without any planning or design to meet the necessary and
essential requirements of the area.  As a result, Los Angeles and its
environs developed into just another sprawling megalopolis.
<p>
In a conspiracy, the automobile and petroleum industries, along with
the support of other vested interests, bought out the city dads (a
general situation that permeates government officials throughout the
country) to make sure that Los Angeles' streetcars and rail systems
would be scuttled or scrapped, seeing to it that all rails and tracks,
and all related facilities were dismantled, never to be a threat to
their interests.  This collusion between the power brokers doomed the
area to its present meandering maze.  (As a mainstay of the present
system, any development and investment that maximizes profits has no
bounds or scruples.)
<p>
Considering the jumble and clutter of its present infrastructural
complex, one can realize what a ponderous undertaking it would be to
reconstruct and redesign Los Angeles, or any other major city in the
United States, into a functional and efficient social and
technological operation.  The dislocation and relocation of thousands
of people in the area while cleaning up the mess and the damage made
by the present economic system would present a hurculean task.  To
determine the feasibility of any plan for reconstruction of any city,
region or the nation, a comprehensive assessment of all factors and
necessary requirements (resources or otherwise) would have to be taken
into consideration.  But everything hinges on a transition from the
present entrenched financial superstructure that is responsible for
the present hodge-podge in the first place.
<p>
The United States has enough natural disasters and man-made calamities
to cope with and keep it preoccupied for now and sometime in the
future without going all over the world looking for and creating
trouble.  If the United States cannot get its priorities straight and
solve its own domestic problems, how can it solve the myriad of
problems that continue to confront this volatile world?
