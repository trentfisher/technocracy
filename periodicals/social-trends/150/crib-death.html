In an article for the <i>AP Science Writer</i>, 6/96, Paul Recer
writes that infant deaths have plummeted 30 percent in two years
because more infants are sleeping flat on their backs now than face
down.  Why is this so?  Before World War II mothers were told that
babies slept better face down, and no infant deaths caused by this
sleeping position were recorded.  It was thought then that babies were
safer sleeping on their stomachs than on their backs because if they
vomited in their sleep, the mucous would not roll back in their throat
and drown them  If babies didn't die sleeping on their stomachs then,
why would they do so now?  Doesn't this strike you as being a little
strange? 
<p>
Bob Woffinden, writing for <i>The Guardian </i>(liberal), London,
April 1, 1995:  &quot;PVC mattress coverings were introduced in
1948-49, and fire retardants were first put into them in 1951.  From
1953 onward, the deaths appeared to rise steadily until they
significantly increased in the mid-1980s.  Under government pressure
to enhance fire safety, all companies had put increased amounts of
fire retardants into furnishing materials, crib mattresses
included. 	&quot;SIDS, also known as crib death, has not always
been an inherent danger of parental life.  It was first described as a
medical phenomenon by Dr. A.M. Barrett in 1953.  He estimated that
unexplained infant deaths then were three to four times what they had
been a few years earlier and that the additional numbers occurred
mainly in sleep.  Queries were naturally raised about the historical
perspective&#151;perhaps crib death had never previously been noticed,
monitored, or recorded&#151;but by the end of the 1960s, the consensus
of scientific and medical opinion was that there had been no complete
casualty rate before the second world war.
<p>
``From 1986-88, approximately 1,500 babies died annually in England
and Wales, all in the same mysterious way.  They showed  no symptoms
of illness; they just suddenly capitulated.  There were crib deaths in
the U.S., Australia, and New Zealand and throughout Western Europe.
There appeared to be none in parts of Africa and in China, India, nor
were there any in Japan where infants slept on cotton futons
impregnated with boric acid, a safe fire retardant. Yet Japanese
infants in America suffered crib death at the same rate as the rest of
the population.  However, when Japan imported Western-style mattresses
that had become popular, crib death began to appear for the first
time.
<p>``English scientist Barry Richardson had spent most of his life
studying the deterioration of materials and the associated health
risks.  More than 200 mattresses that babies had died on were obtained
from coroners.  All were found to be contaminated with the fungus
<i>Scopulariopsis brevicaulis</i>, particularly in the areas exposed
to the warmth and perspiration of the baby.  The search for arsenic in
the presence of much phosphorus and antimony continued.  And then it
all clicked.  This fungus was working on phosphorus and antimony
compounds.  The tests were repeated, looking for phosphine and stibine
(the gaseous form of antimony).  They were found right away.  Arsenic,
phosphorus, and antimony are adjacent Group Five elements in the
periodic table and react similarly. Their gaseous forms are
exceedingly dangerous, and infants are especially sensitive to them.
Once in the bloodstream, the elements cause cardiac inhibition.  The
heart beats slower and slower until it stops altogether.''
<p>
Richardson's scientific findings created a shock wave and some are
disputing  them.  What has never been publicized is that after
Richardson completed his research in 1991 and published his report,
&quot;Cot Death:  Must Babies Still Die?&quot;, manufacturers already
had been alerted to the risks and changed the composition of the
fire-retardant materials, leaving out antimony.  So, could this be the
reason fewer babies are dying instead of the change from sleeping on
their stomachs to their backs?
