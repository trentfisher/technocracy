What's wrong with this food stamp picture?
<p>
In a letter to the local paper, a male shopper writes:  ``Earlier
today I was going through the line in a local supermarket when I
noticed a young man behind me sipping on a drink.  He was about 25
years old, a strapping young man who could have been a model for a
body-building magazine.  I heard the check-out lady tell him the drink
was 82 cents.  He gave her a $1 food stamp and pocketed the 18 cents
change.  As I left the store, I saw him get in a rather late model
sports car and drive on down the road.  Why is it I have difficulty
with this scene?''
<p>
Because, Mr. Shopper, you look down on this young food-stamp recipient
as one of those welfare cheats you are supporting with your
hard-earned tax dollars, but what about the big welfare gougers!  You
made no mention of them. We have corporate welfare and military
welfare and, of course, political welfare, all embracing those who
have it made in the financial world and who usually cry the loudest
against social programs for the needy.
<p>
Georgia Rep. Cynthia McKinney says that Corporations have seen their
share of the nation's tax  burden reduced from 32 percent in 1952 to 9
percent in 1992.
<p>
Norman Soloman, columnist for <i>Creators Syndicate, Inc.</i> writes:
``Only 10 percent of the U.S. Treasury's revenue is from `corporate
income taxes.' In contrast, 68 percent, a whopping $1 trillion, pours
in from `personal income taxes' or `Social Security, Medicare, and
unemployment and other retirement taxes.'''
<p>
``...The key welfare program known as AFDC&#151;Aid to Families With
Dependent Children&#151;accounts for just 1 percent of the federal
budget.  In fact, the IRS reports, if you add up all that the
U.S. government spends on AFDC, Medicaid and food stamps plus
'supplemental security income and related programs', you'll get a
grand total of 12 percent of the federal budget.  Another 6 percent is
devoted to health research and public health programs, unemployment
compensation, assisted housing and social services.
<p>
``Meanwhile, military spending soaks up 19 percent of federal outlays,
not counting veterans' benefits.  Nearly three-quarters of a billion
dollars is going to the Pentagon each day.  For firms with military
contracts, the Defense Department is a gigantic cash cow.''
<p>
Peter DeFazio of Oregon noted that ``wasteful Pentagon spending''
amounts to the largest discretionary spending category in the entire
federal budget.
<p>
Another perk for the military is promoting officers just about to
retire to increase their pensions, which are based on the highest rank
they have held, and awarding disability allowances even if the
disability resulted from a nonservice-related activity, such as
shooting yourself in the foot in a hunting accident.
<p>
And military personnel can retire early with healthy pensions, go on
to other jobs and collect additional pensions after retirement plus
collecting their Social Security entitlements. One military
high-ranking officer was hired as head of the Red Cross in the 1950s
at $55,000 a year, which made a substantial addition to his ample
military retirement pension.  (How much does the Red Cross pay its top
honcho today?  Elizabeth Dole, who is presently on leave as president
of the Red Cross, gets $200,000 a year.)  And how can a non-profit
organization afford to pay such lucrative salaries?  From donations?
No wonder the Red Cross charges so much for <i>donated</i> blood.  By
the way, even though Dole retired from the Senate, he still gets a
$100,000 congressional pension&#151;under the munificent pension plan
that Dole and his colleagues established for themselves at taxpayers'
expense. 
<p>
Taxpayers say little about welfare for huge corporations, including
big farmers, timber companies, and oil conglomerates, the latter being
allowed to set our oil and gas prices as well;  they say even less
about welfare for the military or hefty perks for politicians, both
active and retired; and where is citizen rage when strip miners can
buy government land for peanuts, extract the metals and minerals and
then go on to putting that land to some other money-making venture
while jumping through their tax loopholes.
<p>
With corporations, welfare is called a subsidy&#151;which means,
according to Webster, a gift of public money to private industry.
There is no such euphemism for people in need of financial help;
welfare, to most people not on it, means an underserved handout.
<p>
Yes, taxpayers are overly tolerant regarding welfare for the rich, but
just let someone spend 82 cents on a cold drink with a dollar food
stamp and pocket the change and afterwards drive away in a fairly
late-model sports car, and they jump up and down and write letters to
the editor.  It seems that social priorities in this country are a bit
askew.
