The human animal is a problem solver.  All people hate to have
problems so they act to solve them.  People often create more
problems for themselves in their attempt to solve a problem by
incorrectly analyzing the problem, misinterpreting results of
applying the problem solution (lack of correct feedback).  Human
behavioral patterns that develop by making such mistakes are
usually called neurotic.  Such patterns usually result from
experiences early in life.  This means that the behavioral
patterns of many persons are based on evaluations of situations
they were probably not old enough to properly understand.  As
they grow older, the initial situation is forgotten and the
person responds automatically to a certain situation without
regard to appropriateness.  In our present society probably few
people are free of such behavioral patterns.  In our present
society with its rapid evolution, behavioral patterns quickly
become obsolete due to the shifting environment.  We may laugh
at the television character, Archie Bunker, who continuously
responds to situations as though he were frozen in time several
generations earlier, but he is little more than a reflection of
much of our present society.  When we refer to someone as
behaving in a childish fashion, it is probably some neurotic
pattern that we are referring to.
<p>
The human animal is too complex to say that a neurotic
behavioral pattern such as greed can be caused by only one type
of situation.  The intense desire to acquire material goods
endlessly with no thought to end use (greed) is a destructive,
neurotic pattern.  Probably the most extreme example is the
miser who starves to death with thousands of dollars stuffed in
his mattress.  Such behavior must result from insecurity but in
the end destroys its owner.
<p>
Greed is a typical neurotic pattern.  In all such behavior
several questions apply:
(1)  Is the behavior producing the desired result?  (2)   Is it
harmful to anyone?
(3)  Are you consciously aware of what you are doing?  (4)  Are
you in control of what you are doing?  If you are having trouble
with these questions, you probably are running on auto-pilot.
Habit patterns are a necessary part of living.  If we had to
consciously consider every move we made, accomplishment of any
task would become difficult.  The question is:  Does the habit
pattern contribute to the intended objective or not?  If it
doesn't work, you're probably doing it wrong.
<p>
Technocracy offers a new social design for the operation of a
high-energy civilization on the North American Continent.  While
no redesign of the human psyche was intended or planned, it
should be obvious that a drastic change in the social
environment is bound to affect human behavior.
<p>
Technocracy never promised a utopia where all would be happy.
Happiness is a quality developed within an individual that
usually results when the individual behaves in harmony with his
environment.  The Price System is an inappropriate social system
for our present level of technological development and as such
is a neurotic behavioral pattern.  It is probably not too
surprising that a neurotic social system produces neurotic
behavior.
<p>
Some neurotic behavior is not terribly harmful, but it is never
helpful.  For instance, frustration with the immediate course of
events in ones personal life is seldom solved by overeating.
Greed is a pattern that has a tendency to destroy not only the
persons so afflicted but usually all those around them.
<p>
Technocrats are often asked what Technocracy proposes to do
about greed.  The answer is--nothing.  There will, even in a
Technate, not be anything blocking a person from drawing the
wrong conclusions from a situation.  The clinical psychologists
seem in little danger of losing their backlog although the
introduction of a more harmonious social order should help.
