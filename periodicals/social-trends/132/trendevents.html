Because of the transformation in industry and business, many of the
management and professional jobs once available no longer exist.  Even college
graduates are being forced to lower their sights or expectations when starting
their careers.
<p>
According to Paul Ryscavage, a labor economist at the Census Bureau
whose report appeared in the Monthly Labor Review, published by the Department
of Labor, jobs within the domain of highly skilled and educated persons shrunk
during the 1990-91 recession, from 53.6 percent to 48.4 percent between 1989
and 1991.  And there is no indication that this trend will change as industry
and businesses continue with downsizing and massive layoffs of workers in all
categories.
<p>
The shift and change in the labor market has become more pronounced among
college graduates.  In fact, 30 percent of those graduating from college this
decade could end up unemployed, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor
Statistics.  A piece of sheepskin does not guarantee upward mobility nor a job
in the field or subject of matriculation.
<p>
Data collected by the U.S. Census Bureau is not too encouraging.  In just
three years, the income of the average college-educated male in his 20s has
dropped significantly--from $31,829 in 1989 to $27,782 in 1991.  In terms of
income in 1991, young college graduates are no better off than they were in
1983.  (The Census Bureau reports that the greatest drop in American incomes
were those households headed by persons in the 15-24 age group whose incomes
fell by 5.8 percent.)
<p>
The youth of America should have realized long ago that their future, and that
of the country, is bleak and can only get worse in an economic system that is
geared to financial considerations and profits.  All of the ballyhoo about
getting a higher education needs to be reevaluated.  What is the purpose and
the objective?  Education for what?
<p>
Why is it that no college or university teaches or offers a course in the
dynamics of social change where the knowledge and expertise of the nation can
be used and applied in a way where all of the country's resources are mobilized
to provide a harmonious and quality lifestyle for every American citizen?
<p>
More than 10,000 persons turned out on a cold morning in Detroit, lining up
in response to the mere possibility of a full or part-time job.  A job in an
automobile factory?  No.  A casino! (The Tampa Tribune 11-1993)
