<strong>Forbes Magazine</strong>, the highly conservative
business publication, stated on the cover of its February 1985
issue that ``The failure of the U.S. nuclear power program ranks
as the largest managerial disaster in business history, a
disaster on a monumental scale.  The utility industry has
already invested $125 billion in nuclear power, with an
additional $140 billion to come before the decade is out, and
only the blind, or the biased, can now think that most of the
money has been well spent.  It is a defeat for the U.S. consumer
and for the competitiveness of U.S. industry, for the utilities
that undertook the program and for the private enterprise system
that made it possible.''
<p>
The nuclear power industry provides an excellent example of the
many pitfalls that exist within our highly competitive
capitalistic Price System.  Many nuclear plants were built on
what is referred to as fast-track construction, which means that
design errors were intentionally left for others to correct;
very little checking of vendor quality was done.  Regulations
affecting basic design criteria were subject to frequent shifts.
Construction frequently proceeded without any planning.  Under
such circumstances it is surprising that problems similar to
those at Three Mile Island have not occurred with great
frequency.
<p>
The inept management of nuclear power has effectively eliminated
it as an option for expanding our supply of electrical energy.
Yet every year our need for power increases.  With proper
research and planning it is possible to increase our supply of
electricity and reduce our dependency on energy outside North
America by making use of technology available to us now.
<p>
Many years ago Technocracy Inc. made a design proposal that
rated far more serious attention than it received then or since.
In terms of implementation, the first step would have to be the
installation of a high voltage D.C. transmission line linking
the entire North American Continent into a single electrical
network.  Direct current cannot be transformed to higher or
lower voltages; therefore it is necessary to transform the power
to be transmitted up to the proper voltage with alternating
current then convert the power to direct current for
transmission.  This means that large and expensive substations
must be constructed.  What, then, is the gain?  With the same
size conductor, about twice the amount of power can be
transmitted.
<p>
High voltage alternating current also generates many unfavorable
side effects.  Capacitance and inductance effects with the
ground, and other conductors nearby are created that must be
allowed for in the design.  Line losses due to radiation are
significant.  The 1,000,000 volt direct current transmission
line proposed by Technocracy Inc. has no equal even today.  It
would be a coaxial bipolar conductor with one pole running down
the center, separated from the second pole, in the form of a
pipe, by spacer rings.
<p>
Surrounding this outer pole would be another, larger diameter
pipe to contain both poles. Technocracy's original proposal
called for nitrogen gas as an insulator between the two poles.
Today sulfur hexaflouride would most likely be used.  The two
concentric outer pipes would use some type of dielectric oil to
protect against leaks.  The line would be mounted in an
underground concrete vault.
<p>
When Technocracy first made this proposal, such a thing had
never been heard of.  Many were certain it couldn't be done and
that the cost would be prohibitive.  Today, for the most part,
the technology required for such a line exists in gas insulated
substations.  The cost and size of D.C. substations are
dropping, and a little more research could contribute to a
further decline in cost.
<p>
Such a line would reduce the right-of-way from about 150 feet
down to about 8 feet.  The conductor would be underground and
not nearly so vulnerable to destruction by man or nature.  Due
to rising power demands, right-of-way corridors are becoming
crowded with power lines.  There are no fewer than 14 major
transmission lines leading onto and out of Grand Coulee Dam.
One of the major right-of-way corridors connecting California to
the Northwest has seven transmission lines.  Maintenance on such
an underground D.C. transmission system would be almost
negligible.
<p>
Presently most utilities require 20% to 30% over their base load
generating capacity to service their peak load.  This additional
capacity could be reduced with the ability to pass the peak
loads from time zone to time zone as the peak loads travel with
the sun.  It would then become possible to generate power in the
most efficient way and at the least cost.  Hydropower sites far
removed from the major population centers could be developed.
The hydropower of Northern Canada, for instance, could be sent
anywhere it was needed.
<p>
As the second part of such a design, Technocracy proposed the
installation of a Continental Hydrology.  This would involve the
damming of major North American rivers, which would provide much
more needed hydropower plus a canal system for transporting
goods at low cost, and it would slow down the rivers, adding to
their size; also, it would strengthen the water tables and help
conserve our fresh water.
<p>
Hydroelectricity is the safest, cleanest, and cheapest source of
electric energy available, present or future.  The installation
of a D.C. transmission grid and a Continental Hydrology on North
America would act to reduce the cost of energy for all by making
available the cheapest form of electrical generation.  By
interconnecting the entire Continent with this type of grid, a
minimum of maintenance would be required.
<p>
Nuclear power (particularly as executed under our present Price
System) is not only risky, it produces an even more deadly waste
product about which debate still rages.  What do we do with it?
Fuel cells are now beginning to be produced in power-plant size
that operate in near silence at efficiencies far higher than
thermal plants, and their primary waste products are oxygen and
heat.  Fuel cells can be produced on an assembly line basis then
connected together on the site to make the largest station
required for the area, thus drastically reducing the lead time
required for construction.  More research into fluidized bed
combustion of coal could result in large reductions in
objectionable effluents and increase efficiencies as well.
Although a few years from full development, thermonuclear power
promises to be far cleaner and much safer than nuclear power.
Solar power is still under development, but the research is
producing good results.
