Consider the dandelion, a common yellow-flowered composite herb,
as Webster defines it, that versatile weed with the
distinguished name.
<p>
How did it come by its name? Who knows. Its blossom resembles a
lion's mane.  Imagine a face on it framed by a thick crop of
yellow string-like petals, and you have the majestic lion's
head, king of the jungle.
<p>
And what is a dande? According to the dictionary it means
"first-rate", although Webster spells it "dandy." So there you
have it. A first-rate king. (Remember, definitions can be
arbitrary, and they are not necessarily related to fact.)
<p>
During the great depression, many people survived by eating
dandelions. They parboiled the nutritional leaves to remove the
bitterness and then steamed them, a worthy substitute for
spinach and other similar greens. The more innovative cooks
dipped the dandelion blossoms in batter and deep-fried them. And
the blossoms made tasty, potent wine, a diversion to help people
through hard times. And dandelions grew in abundance and were
free to hungry depression survivors. All they had to do was
harvest them.
<p>
Besides feeding people, dandelions aided the environment. Their
long tap roots held moisture in the ground and nourished
insects. So what do we do about this valuable life-sustaining
herb? We kill it! A lawn can be dried up and brown, as many
lawns in the Northwest were last summer--and still are--because
of the drought, but the persistent dandelion, in vivid contrast,
retains its moisture and color and attempts to nourish the land
and insects despite formidable odds. We can't stand that bright
spot in our perfect lawn because we consider it a lowly weed, so
we eliminate it with poison. In its place we've planted shrubs,
hybrid flowers, vegetable gardens and a manicured lawn that
require lots of water, and the more poison we spread to maintain
that perfect look, the more water we use to mitigate the toxic
effects of the poison.
<p>
And what  happens to the insects?  We've eliminated their food
and moisture supply so now they have to eat those irritating
domestic plants when they really prefer weeds. They even come
into our houses in search of food and moisture. This calls for
more poison. Watch out for your babies and your pets. Read the
labels on the spray container: <strong>Keep out of the hands of
children; if swallowed or inhaled do</strong> this, do that, see
your physician; keep your pets inside for such and such a time
after spraying dandelions, or keep them outside after spraying
bugs inside. All this bother and precaution to get rid of
dandelions, and dandelions never did us any harm. And no mention
is made on the labels of how all this poison affects nature's
underground water wells as it seeps into them, aided by rain and
artificial watering.
<p>
You know, besides dandelions there are other beneficial weeds
that could be left scattered throughout gardens, nurturing
insects. Aphids love thistle. So do other insects, including
bees. But thistles are weeds! Kill them!
<p>
Tansy ragwort is another source of nourishment for aphids, those
tiny insects that suck the juice of plants, but inadvertently
get a strain of tansy in baled hay, and it can kill cattle. Some
counties attempt to enforce laws that require you to pull your
tansy up by the roots; it spreads rapidly. Why do we have so
much tansy ragwort growing in open fields in the Northwest?
Because we've ravished our forests, creating a haven for tansy
and other tenacious weeds. Tansy won't grow in the forest. So to
compensate for our sins, we import tiger-striped worms to
destroy the tansy. What happens when these greedy little
monsters run out of tansy? What will they eat then? Stay tuned
in for the next exciting chapter.
<p>
Now wouldn't it be nice to live in the forest and view the flora
and fauna from our picture window? So to make room for our
house, we cut a few trees, trees that took two or three hundred
or more years to grow, and use them for firewood. There we sit,
snug and warm in front of the fire, gazing at the natural beauty
through our picture window. Deer, porcupines, birds and
squirrels entertain us. And then comes spring. The carpenter
ants march in, hacking, sawing, biting, knawing, leaving piles of
sawdust in dark places. They love to make their homes in dead
wood. Call in the exterminator! Spray those destructive
carpenter ants and anything else that gets in the way. Never
mind that the carpenter ants didn't invade our habitat until we
invaded theirs. And if this doesn't work, get rid of the trees.
They make the house too damp and dark anyway.
<p>
We create an unnatural oasis in a desert in one area by making
a desert out of a natural oasis somewhere else. We kill off
creatures of prey and their habitat in our wanton disregard for
our environment and then fight unwelcome pests that multiply
uncontrolled. In this barbarian world that we falsely label
civilized, we have yet to learn the importance of living in
harmony with nature.
