<p>
Our forests, like other families, need the closeness of family
members to support them, nurture them. When trees get a foothold
in an open field, only those species can survive that are able
to tolerate direct sunlight. Several kindsof pine, birch, and
poplar have this ability.
<p>
As these trees grow, they provide shade for other species that
require protection from the sunlight, such as tulip, poplar and
many other species, including red oak and maple. These trees
will grow until they crowd out the sun-loving trees that nursed
them. Finally, their shade becomes so dense that their own
seedlings die for lack of sunlight, and they in turn will be
replaced by the shade-tolerant trees.
<p>
Trees of intermediate stages--the oaks, tulips and others--
eventually grow so big that their own seedlings cannot survive
in their shade. They will be replaced by shade-tolerant trees
like the beech, sugar maple and
hemlock.
<p>
In a mature forest, the beech, sugar maple and hemlock, and
other trees whose seedlings can grow in deep shade, become
masters. They actually select and dominate all other life in the
forest. Nothing can live that is not adapted to the shade,
moisture and climate that they have established. Such a forest
is known as a climax forest.
<p>
There are many types of climax communities of trees and plants,
each one adapted to its own preferred conditions of soil and
climate. This can be clearly seen on many mountainsides where
forests are divided into bands of zones of trees, each one
adapted to the conditions that prevail at its own preferred
elevation. Douglas firs have small roots and great height. They
have two requirements for survival: they must grow in thick
stands for protection from the wind, and they must have enough
moisture tosupport a thick stand. Farther down the mountainside
where the soil is deeper and rainfall less, these trees will
give way to a zone of ponderosa pines that have a deeper root
system and require less rain. Below these there will be other
successive zones of trees, bushes and grass.
<p>
Higher on the mountain, at timberline, the hardiest trees make
their last stand against wind and cold. Spruces and white barked
pine are among the last to succumb. Above them the low,
flowering plants of the mountain meadows take over, and finally
these give way to the lichens that grow on the bare rocky peaks.
<p>
Mountain forests play an important part in the world's water
supply system; in many areas, mountains are the source of water
for all the surrounding country. When a current of warm, moist
air blowing inland from the pacific strikes a California
mountain range and flows upward over the mountain it is chilled
in the cold atmosphere above. When the air is chilled it loses
much of its power to hold the moisture. The water vapor
condenses to form a cloud, and under proper conditions, much of
it will fallto the earth as rain or snow.
<p>
Trees shade the snow, holding it in deep, slow-melting drifts.
They build an absorbent covering on the ground to hold the
moisture as it becomes available, letting it out slowly to feed
the streams and give life to the lowlands through summer
droughts.
<p>
Plants on the ground under the trees protect the soil from the
hammering force of the raindrops. They tie the soil into place
and make it an absorbent storage reservoir for water.
<p>
The destruction of a forest may spell disaster to communities a
thousand miles away. When trees are blown down in a windstorm,
their broken roots and weakened sap flow can no longer withstand
the attacks of bark beetles. Under a tangle of branches they are
inaccessible to the woodpeckers that ordinarily catch most of
the beetles that do gain entrance. The beetles, thus protected,
multiply like an explosion, spreading out to attack and kill the
healthy trees in the surrounding forest.
<p>
The dead trees dry out and turn to tinder, becoming far more
vulnerable to fire than a normal forest. The catastrophe started
by a local windstorm may spread out to ruin the forests on an
entire water shed. The same thing may happen when man improperly
cuts or grazes a forest.
<p>
After the fire, the land is dead, and from it death will spread
for a thousand miles over the country below, carried there by
floods and droughts.
<p>
When raindrops strike unprotected soil, the fine soil particles
spatter into the air. Falling back, they fill the crevices
between the larger particles, making the surface waterproof.
Instead of being stored in the earth, the water now runs off ina
flood, tearing away the unprotected soil as it goes.
<p>
The price of removing forest protection is great: Rich soil that
once lay level with the tops of tree roots can be carried away
by floods, leaving the roots exposed and sterile with the sand
five feet below the base of its trunk.
<p>
A farmer can lose his entire farm, carried away by a flood
caused by the destruction of a forest on a distant watershed
that he had never seen. Where did his land go? To join other
farms whose top soil had been carried away by floods, much of it
mixed with gravel and entirely useless, some of it dropped in
the ocean.
<p>
Several years ago the reservoir that was part of the water
system that supplied the city of Santa Barbara, CA was
completely filled with sediments washed off the burned hills
after a fire on the watershed above it.

<h3><a name="part2">The Forest and its Inhabitants</a></h3>
<p>
Each wild creature can multiply safely only up to the limit that
the forest can feed and shelter it.
<p>
The food provided by plants is used to build the bodies of
insects, animals and birds. Each of these in turn is eventually
used as food by other living things. Thus it is passed along
from mouth to mouth in a food chain to support a series of
creatures, until at last it is returned to enrich the soil. A
catbird will eat its own weight in insects every day. The forest
could not survive without the help of birds. But to receive this
help it must always provide enough insects. Properly controlled
insects are a necessary part of a plant community. It is only
when the balance between insects and  controls is upset that
some become a menace.
<p>
The forest has its own sanitary corps. A turkey vulture, for
instance, feeds on dead fish. Many kinds of scavengers--birds,
insects and animals--help to keep the land clean. All are
necessary parts of the organization that keeps the community
functioning.
<p>
The ability of the land to support animal life depends directly
on the food and shelter that it can provide. In winter mice
search for seeds among dead weeds. The winter landscape produces
no food. It supports only those creatures that can survive on
the food left over from summer.
<p>
Nature automatically adjusts the number of predators to the
needs of the community. Well-fed deer have the strength to
protect themselves and their young against the attacks of
coyotes. But in the winter when the ground is covered with snow,
they must depend chiefly on the buds of trees and bushes for
food. Only the deer that can find enough food to maintain
strength can survive.
<p>
All animals have the power to multiply faster than their normal
death rate. For its own survival, a community must have
policemen to hold the multiplication of population within the
limits of its food supply. Red-shouldered hawks monitor the
snake population.
<p>
On land where there are not enough predators to protect the
community, deer multiply beyond the capacity of the land to
support them. They then browse the tree branches bare as high as
they can reach. The land loses its power to feed them the
following winter, and the result is starvation.
<p>
The predator protects the community. When the deer multiply
beyond the limits that the winter food supply can support, the
coyote removes those that are weakened by hunger. Coyotes in
turn can survive only so long as there is a supply of meat to
support them. Thus through the help of the predators, nature
maintains a balance between each species and its food supply.
<p>
Each creature is a specialist. A red-bellied woodpecker has feet
adapted to walking on the bark of trees, a bill adapted to
drilling through bark to reach the insects beneath, and tail
feathers with tips fashioned to provide support while it works.
<p>
The nuthatch also has feet adapted to walk on bark. Its bill is
adapted to probing among bark crevices for insects, but it is
not strong enough to drill through bark.
<p>
The evening grosbeak has a big bill adapted to cracking seeds.
Each of these different birds is equipped to find its own
special food in its own way. Each may find its food on the same
tree, but each would probably starve if it had to depend on
using the food that supports any of the others. Thus, each plays
a special role in the community.
<p>
Each tree is specially adapted to its own preferred environment.
The saguaro cactus can store great quantities of water in its
body and exist through long periods of drought. A twelve foot
saguaro can live on as little as 1/50 of a quart of water per
day. A date palm, with the help of irrigation, can grow in the
same desert, but it will require 500 quarts per day, twenty-five
thousand times as much.
<p>
Leaping salmon are adapted to excel in their environment. The
dwellers in the streams are an integral part of the forest
community. They depend on the flow of water that in turn is
controlled by the conditions in the forest. Salmon spend most of
their lifein the ocean, growing fat on food origination with
salt water plants. They have the special ability to ascend
streams that are inaccessible to most fish. So at spawning time
they journey upstream to lay their eggs in the headwater, safe
from the predators of the ocean. Through this adaptation the
salmon has become one of the most successful of the fishes,
threatened only by man changing its habitat.
<p>
A five-storied warbler's nest can tell the story of a struggle
for survival--a contest between a yellow warbler and a cowbird.
The cowbird lays its eggs in the nests of smaller birds that
hatch and rear the young, often with fatal results to their own
offspring. A cowbird can lay its eggs in the original nest with
the warbler building a roof over it for a new start, and again
the cowbird will lay an egg. Finally, after several tries, the
warbler will lay its own smaller eggs to be hatched with the
cowbirds. One warbler's nest had five stories built on. Few
birds are as resourceful or persistent as this warbler was.
<p>
Where trees find enough moisture they grow tall and shade out
the grass. Where the moisture is insufficient, grass takes it
all and starves out the trees. At the borderline between grass
and tree zones, there is strong competition. In moist seasons
the seedling trees may find a foothold in the grass, only to die
in the dry seasons that follow.
<p>
Grass roots are the key to survival in dry country. Grass has a
far larger root system than trees in proportion to leaf area,
and its roots are nearer the surface. This gives it an advantage
over trees in dry country. Its roots take all available moisture
as it seeps into the ground, allowing none to filter down to the
tree roots. Even in the struggle between grass and trees, it is
the survival of the fittest.
<p>

<h3><a name="part3">The Making of Topsoil</a></h3>
<p>
he Grand Canyon of the Colorado River tells us a lot about the
earth's history. The area of this canyon was once level, but the
rock was slowly worn away. Rain softened and dissolved its
minerals. Heat and cold expanded and contracted it, causing it
to crack and break into fragments that piled up to form grey
slopes below the cliffs.
<p>
On the surface of small glaciers are rock fragments that have
fallen from the cliffs above. Mixed with the moving glacier ice,
these act like teeth that slowly grind away the face of the
mountain.
<p>
The many layers in the face of the cliff suggest the variety of
minerals that have gone into the building of this rock. These
are mixed together by the ice and later spread over the land
below.
<p>
During the ice ages more than seventeen million miles of the
earth's surface were buried under moving ice, and under its
grinding a large share of the northern soils had their
beginnings.
<p>
The first step in soil building: Slopes below mountain peaks are
composed of rock fragments broken from the face of the cliffs by
the forces of erosion. Slowly this broken rock will be moved
down into the valleys by water, wind and gravity. On the journey
the pieces will be ground together and broken into particles
small enough to form the parent material of soil. Before it can
support life, soil must be anchored into place, enriched and
organized into a living entity by the action of plants and
animals.
<p>
Life makes its start with lichens, moss, and ferns on rock. The
pioneer lichens can exist on bare rocks with very little
moisture. They secrete acid that dissolves minerals from the
rocks, thus creating a seed bed that can absorb moisture and
provide food and a foothold for higher plants. The plant roots
spread out into the surrounding soil tying it into place. From
this foundation of raw soil, the plant community develops.
<p>
The plants build the soil. Chlorophyll in green leaves is the
only substance in nature that has the power to harness the sun's
energy and combine it with elements from air, water and rock
into living tissue. This plant tissue becomes the food that
supports all animal life, and it is the basis for the organic
matter that is an essential part of productive soil. Thus, the
creative work of plants is the essential first step toward
building fertility into soil. By a maze of rootlets and fungus-
fibres, most of them invisible to the eye, plants tie the soil
together. When these die, they make a sponge of absorbent
rotting vegetation. Insects, worms and other animals burrow to
reach this organic food, mixing it thoroughly in the process and
enriching it with their own remains.
<p>
Nature Plows the soil. Today's catastrophe, a fallen tree,
prepares riches for tomorrow. In a mature forest the soil may be
corrugated with ridges and hollows that hold rain and melting
snow and that show where trees have fallen and mixed soil with
vegetation.
<p>
Small animals play a useful role as nature's farmers, plowing
the soil. Some, such as prairie dogs, dig in it to make their
homes; others, like the shrews and moles, tunnel through it in
their search for insects and worms, thus helping to make it rich
and absorbent.
<p>
Insects and worms do their share in soil building, plowing and
mixing it with the vegetation, and enriching it with their
remains as they burrow to seek shelter and food among the plant
roots.Cicada wasps dig tunnels to make a home for their young.
<p>
A soil profile of the finished product: The light lower layer is
the parent soil composed of rock particles. The dark upper layer
is topsoil, built by the action of plants and animals. It may be
as much as 40% organic matter--i.e., living and dead plant and
animal life. This soil has the power to absorb water and the
energy to produce crops.

<h3><a name="part4">The Stream of Life</a></h3>
<p>
A tiny black speck moves into the light on a lake's surface. As
it moves, a trail streams out behind it. At last the shape grows
into a speeding motor boat with the long lines of its wake
sweeping out on either side, dark ribbons onthe glowing water.
<p>
Finally, as it nears one side of the lake, the motor boat
circles twice in wide sweeps and then disappears behind a
headland. On the lake behind it, the lines of the circling wakes
come together in interweaving patterns. In some places they
collide to efface each other. In others they reinforce one
another, finally rolling off in long curves to the distant
shores.
<p>
These rolling waves were set in motion by the energy of the
moving boat that displaced the water in its passing. Each wave
carried within itself a portion of that energy, finally
expending it as it rolled a pebble on the shore, or rocked the
roots of a floating derelict tree, or perhaps washed out the
final handful of dirt from the undermined roots of a tree that
would topple into the water to join the other derelict. Thus,
the energy of the motor boat had its impact on the land far
beyond the vision of the man who set it moving. Just so, the
forces set in motion by every act of man or bird, animal,
insect, or bacterium move out to affect the lives of many other
creatures.
<p>
The principles that govern all these interrelationships are
called the principles of ecology--the science that deals with
the mutual relations between living organisms and
theirenvironment. The subject of ecology is so vast and complex
that no human mind has ever fathomed all its secrets. Many of
them can probably never be unraveled, but the basic principles
of ecology are known, and on the functioning of these known
principles depends the future of all human lives.
<p>
Life is such a personal thing, wrapped up within the being of
every living creature, that it is sometimes hard to realize how
intimately each life is connected with a great many other lives.
<p>
Life is a flowing stream, forever passing away and as constantly
being renewed. The energy that brings us life is supplied from
many different sources, most of them beyond our vision of
experience.
<p>
The bread that comes from the grocery shelf brings minerals and
vitamins that may have been prepared by wheat plants in the soil
of Kansas. Vegetables may bring their special contributions from
the farms of Texas or California. Meat was built by cattle out
of grass that may have drawn its special qualities from the soil
of the western plains. It requires five thousand pounds of water
to produce thegrass that goes into the making of each single
pound of meat. To store this water and supply it to the grass as
needed through summer droughts, the soil must first be prepared
by many generations of earlier plants and animals.
<p>
Bread, vegetables, and meat are merely vehicles for transferring
to us the special properties of soil, air and sunlight gathered
and organized by the plants. With some minor variations, all
these living things are composed of the same elements and in
roughly the same proportions. But each differs in its methods of
obtaining and using them. Plants and animals vary greatly in the
amounts of light, heat and moisture they must have for their
development and in the kinds of soil on which they thrive best.
Each is adapted to its own special environment.
<p>
In our modern civilization we find the stream of our own lives
flowing from many different sources, each adapted to make its
own particular contribution. Why should the citizenof New York
or Pennsylvania want to draw on the soils of Texas or Kansas,
Wyoming, or other far-off places for the minerals and vitamins
that go into the building of his life? The answer is that these
soils are more richly suppliedwith the necessary elements. Some
of them did not originally exist in these spots but were
transported and placed there by a number of different agencies.
<p>
The story of their coming to make possible our own stream of
life lies deep in the past history of the earth.

<h3><a name="part5">What the Rocks Contribute</a></h3>
<p>
There is much that we do not know about the earth's early
history, and our knowledge of its interior today is far from
definite. But there is good evidence that the surface of the
globe was at one time a mass of molten material. Within this
molten mass the heavier elements such as iron and nickel sank
deep below the surface, the lighter elements floating over them.
<p>
Slowly this liquid mass cooled, and as it did the elements that
composed it tended to draw together, each to its own kind, to
form crystals--silica forming quartz, for example--or they
gathered into groups to form more complex minerals, such as mica
or hornblende.
<p>
Over most of the earth's original crust, this grouping of
crystals took the form of granite. Granite ordinarily carries
few of the elements needed for life--potassium being one of the
few--and is a poor environment for a plant. But this thin crust
of granite lay over an uneasy foundation of molten rock. As the
hot mass cooled and contracted, great ridges were forced up to
form mountains, and in some places huge cracks were opened
through which the molten rock from below flowed up to spread in
sheets of lava over the lighter outer layers of rock. Smaller
cracks were filled with molten material to form veins in the
rock. In some cases, vaporized metals from below were cooled and
solidified in these veins,and boiling water, carrying elements
in solution, welled up from the inner earth, to deposit them in
the cracks.
<p>
Thus, some parts of the earth's surface became rich with
concentrations of rare minerals that were gifts from the deep
interior of the earth. In many parts of the world, where hot
springs may be seen boiling to the surface, this process is
still going on.
<p>
These concentrations of minerals, if left undisturbed, would not
have supplied a very wide area with the essentials of life. But
the forces of nature are constantly at work to break up the
rocks and spread them over the earth's surface. Air, water, and
sunlight all do their part. Air supplies carbon dioxide. Falling
rain absorbs this gas from the air to form carbonic acid.
Through the years this acid slowly dissolves the more soluble
minerals from the rocks, leaving crevices where water may enter.
The sun warms the exposed faces of the rock, causing them to
expand and crack, making room for more water. When water
freezes, it expands, so in cold weather the cracks are widened,
sometimes breaking up huge blocks of rock. Thus the rock begins
to disintegrate as soon as it is exposed to the weather until,
at last, it is reduced to the small particles that go into the
making of soil. Much of this soil material lies in place, where
it is born. But a good share is scattered far and wide by other
forces of nature.
<p>
Wind and flowing water sweep rock fragments from the ridges,
drive them against other exposed rocks, grind them to smaller
pieces, and sometimes carry them for many miles to drop them at
last as sediment in distant valleys or in lake or ocean beds.
<p>
Now the water may change from destroyer to builder. As it
carries the dissolved minerals in solution, it may deposit some
of them among these sediments, thus cementing them into rock
again.
<p>
Microscopic living organisms absorb minerals from this liquid
solution, too, and turn them to solids within their substance.
Through the ages their remains have settled on the bottom to
form vast deposits of limestone and phosphates.
<p>
Later on, through movements of the earth's crust, some of these
deposits have been lifted high above the water. Many of our
western mountains are capped by rocks holding fossils of shells
that were made of lime taken from the waterof an ancient sea.
These rocks are now attacked in their turn by the sun and frost
and rain, finally to be scattered over the earth by wind and
water. In past ages enormous quantities of rock have been ground
to dust by the ice of moving glaciers and carried many miles
before being added to the material of the soil.
<p>
It is estimated that there is scarcely a square mile of the
earth's surface that does not contain some ingredient from every
other mile because of the action of wind and water. But, despite
all this stirring and mixing, the soil usually draws most of its
mineral content from the underlying parent rock that produced
it. Where this rock is rich in important minerals, as in the
case of limestone, the soil can usually provide a rich
environment for life. But over rocks like granite or quartzite,
which offer little mineral food, the life above is apt to find a
much less nourishing environment.

<h3><a name="part6">How the Land Gets its Water</a></h3>
<p>
The upheavals and varied contours on
the earth's surface spread out their influence to affect our
lives in many ways. They are among the important factors
innature's water transportation system that makes life possible
on the land.
<p>
Among its many useful qualities, water has one that is
especially valuable to life. When it is warmed above a certain
temperature, it turns to vapor and can be carried by the wind.
When the air is cooled, some of thisvapor turns back to fine
drops of water in the form of clouds and under certain
conditions precipitates as rain.
<p>
The temperature of the air is constantly changing from day to
night and with the seasons. While the sun's rays pass through
the air without raising its temperature, they warm the surface
of the earth and the oceans noticeably. Air coming in contact
with these heated surfaces is then warmed.
<p>
The result is that air near the earth's surface is usually much
warmer than the air high overhead. This added warmth has two
dramatic effects on air. It not only gives it greater power to
absorb moisture, but under its influence, air expands and
becomes lighter. Light air rises through heavy, cooler air
above, while cool air sinks to replace it at the surface. So
there is a steady circulation of air, rising from the warmer
parts of the earth only to be cooled in the upper atmosphere and
returned to earth again.
<p>
But the air with its burden of moisture, moves over definite
pathways before delivering the water back to earth because as
the earth revolves around its axis, the air moves with it, just
as the oceans move in unison with the land.
<p>
The warmest part of the earth is in the tropics, where the warm
earth can give most heat to the surrounding air. So, around the
earth at the equator the warmed air expands and rises to float
over the cold air above, and then flows out over it north and
south toward the poles; while down below, on the surface, the
cooler air from north and south flows in toward the equator to
fill its place. Thus there is established a vast system of air
movement, first toward the equator, then upward and overhead
back toward the poles.
<p>
As the returning air becomes chilled overhead, most of it
drops to earth again before completing the poleward journey. On
reaching the earth it will have lost some of its more than
1,000-mile-an-hour eastward motion; but it is still moving a
good deal faster than the earth in its new location with the
smaller "circumference." Thus, over a wide area of the earth's
surface there is created a band of westerly winds, where the air
is moving eastward faster than the earth. As this air moves back
toward the equator it again reaches the faster moving part of
the world, until at last it lags behind the earth's motion and
so becomes a northeasterly wind. The world system of air
transportation actually has two forces driving it: first, the
motion from west to east given it by the spin of the earth, and
second, the movement between the equator and the poles, given it
by the heat of the sun.
<p>
The environment that supports life extends far beyond the vision
of experience of the things that live there. It's most important
feature may lie in the distant mountain ranges, perhaps a
thousand miles away. And events like forestfires, which affect
the ability of the mountains to store and control their supply
of water, may decide the issue of life or death for the
creatures in the lowlands.
<p>
The influences of the mountain watersheds extend to farmlands
far down the valley of the Mississippi. But here new forces
begin to affect the water supply. The streams of air that flowed
around the north and south ends of the mountains near the coast
have by now begun to draw together again. In the winter the
northern air stream sweeps as an icy blast through Canada and
then down through the Dakotas. Part of the southern stream flows
over the warm Gulf of Mexico, picking up a heavy supply of
moisture. When the two streams come together over the central
United States, the cold, heavy northern current acts like a
barrier mountain range. The warm southern current rises over it,
and like the air over the mountains it is chilled to produce
rain or snow. Storms of this kind are familiar on every
newspaper weather map that shows the meeting of warm and cold
fronts. They are an important source of moisture in the Central
United States in winter.
<p>
In warm weather the local thunderstorm takes its place as an
important water producer. It comes chiefly as a result of
temperature differences on earth's surface. There may be many
causes for these differences. For example, the dark earth of a
plowed field will absorb more heat than the surrounding forest,
and over this warm field the air will rise. As it goes higher
the moisture in the air begins to condense into water droplets,
producing the towering cumulous clouds whose contours outline
the movements of the rising air. Given the proper combination of
heat, moisture and subsequent chilling, the cloud will at last
build up to produce a thunderstorm.

<h3><a name="part7">Life Prepares its own Environment</a></h3>
<p>
The wide variations in rainfall over different parts of the
country produce important effects on the quality of the soil. We
might expect soil fertility to increase with abundant rainfall.
But actually it often deteriorates. We have seen how rain
combines with carbon dioxide from the air to become a mild acid
that dissolves minerals from the rocks. If the rain is not too
heavy these dissolved minerals stay near the surface where the
plants can use them for food, and under such conditions the soil
may become very fertile. Some of the most fertile soil in the
United States, for example, is in the Arizona desert where these
mineral solutions have accumulated for ages. With irrigation, a
desert may become fabulously productive. But with too much
irrigation, some have been ruined; for when the soil is given
more water than it can hold, its dissolved minerals are washed
away in a process know as leaching. They are carried out of
reach of the plant roots. The water that brought out the
productive power of the soil can thus ruin it and turn it back
again to desert minus its former potentialities.
<p>
When the land receives too much rain it tends to rob the soil in
the same way, leaching away the dissolved minerals. The dividing
line between an annual rainfall that builds and one that leaches
comes somewhere between 20 and 30 inches, depending partly on
the temperature and the amount of moisture evaporation, and
partly, too, on the quality of the soil and its ability to
absorb water and to hold it. This ability in its turn depends
very largely on the help of plants and animals that bring to the
soil new qualities not possessed by the original rock particles.
<p>
A good soil is really a combination of three basic ingredients:
first, the rock particles that are its foundation; second, the
organic matter given it by dead plants and animals; and third, a
community of living plant and animal organisms.
<p>
Air, rock, water, and sunlight--these are the four sources from
which come all living things and their environment. On the bare
sands of the desert the sun's rays strike in tiny units of
energy moving with atomic speed. Some of them we can feel as
heat or see as light. These speeding units impart some of their
energy to the dead sands, which temporarily store it in the form
of heat, but when the sun sinks, this newly acquired energy is
radiated back into space and lost. The sand becomes as cold and
dead as ever. But chlorophyll in the leaves of green plants
exists as an agent for garnering these units of solar energy. It
makes of the green leaf a laboratory in which nature creates
food for living creatures and carries on unceasingly the magic
of building life.
<p>
Like the sand, a field of grass absorbs the sun's rays, but when
night comes the grass does not give back this newly gained
energy. In its green laboratory the chlorophyll blends the sun's
captured radiance together with elements taken from the air, the
water, and the soil, and builds these dead materials into
organized living form to make new blades of grass.
<p>
This grass is cool and quiet, giving no hint of the sunlight
stored within its framework. But dry it out and touch a match to
it. The blades of grass--these tiny bits of organized gas and
sunlight--blaze up with a flame hot enough to kill a man. All of
that fierce heat is merely a release of the same energy that the
cool, moist plants have been quietly gathering from the sunlight
and storing for later use.
<p>
If the grass is not burned, the energy will remain stored within
its substance. If it is eaten by an animal, its life force is
transferred with it into the body of the animal to sustain the
spark that we call life.
<p>
But, for all its abilities as a life builder, the plant is not
entirely self-sufficient. Its principal building material is
carbon, which it takes from the air. This carbon, once it is
locked up in the plant, becomes useless for other plants unless
it is later released into the air again. Throughout the ages
that they have existed on earth, plants have locked up enormous
quantities of carbon in this manner and stored it in the ground,
often in the form ofcoal. If we could picture the thousands of
tons of coal that were once used every day throughout the world
and could realize that, with all that had been burned, there was
enough left to last us for another thousand years, we could
appreciate something of the amount of carbon that has been
withdrawn from the air. But even this is only a drop compared
with the amount that is used by plants and then returned to the
air again by the animals and bacteria that eat the plants,
decompose them, and release their elements. Withoutthe help of
this cycle of use and return, the plants might before now have
eliminated all life from the earth by using up all of their
basic food.
<p>
Some scientific evidence seems to indicate that in the early
days of the world there was not enough free oxygen available in
the air to support animal life. But there is oxygen locked up in
the plant's two chief foods: carbon dioxide and water. From
these the plants draw, respectively, carbon and hydrogen, and in
the process they release oxygen in a form that animals can use.
Through this action of vegetation, the world's supply of free
oxygen has been built and maintained.
<p>
So, even before our environment could start to support us, it
had to be built up by a multitude of interacting forces,
including living things. And the hierarchy of life had to start
from the beginning with the simplest microscopic single cells
that, step by step, prepared the way for higher forms.
<p>
There exist dramatic examples of land where man has destroyed
all life. In them we can see some of the futile attempts of our
common plants to make a fresh start and can visualize something
of the slow process by which an environment must build up from
its simplest beginnings before it can support life as we know
it.

<h3><a name="part8">Life Comes to the Soil</a></h3>
<p>
There is a spot in the woodlands of southeastern Tennessee that
can never be forgotten by one who has seen it. To reach it, one
may travel for a hundred miles through forest-covered hills,
rich with laurel, azalea, and rhododendron, and along springs
and brooks and ravines that sometimes open up into green meadows
where cattle graze.
<p>
Suddenly this green world disappears. The forest gives way to a
hundred square miles of desert as dead as the Sahara. The
rolling hills are cut into rows of low-steep-sided ridges,
sterile and bare of any life. The soil is dry, the springs and
brooks are gone. In this area the annual rainfall is less than
in the surrounding country. The winds are stronger. It is hotter
in summer and colder in winter. Here and there on this desert
there stand in rows the dead skeletons of small trees, planted
by people who hoped to start a new forest.
<p>
The soil in the nearby woodland is dark, rich and spongelike.
That on the desert is coarse, hard and yellow. This desert was
once covered by a forest and by rich forest soil. But afterwards
that soil lay five miles down the valley at the bottom of a
reservoir, and the shoals of coarse desert soil grew deeper,
year by year, as every rain washed its fresh quota down to the
reservoir.
<p>
This all happened because many years ago, a copper smelter was
built here, and the fumes from the smelter killed the
surrounding trees, thereby setting in motion a train of events
that finally produced the desert. The owners of the smelter had
long since learned to control these fumes, which no longer
poisoned the air so seriously; but the harm had been done.
<p>
After the fumes were controlled, many attempts were made to
restore the forest. Desert grasses were planted in the hope of
furnishing some green cover to hold the soil  in place; for rich
soil cannot exist without the help of plants to build and
protect it. But with the killing of the forest, the living soil
that gave it life had also been killed. There were no roots to
hold the soil in place, no litter to absorb the rain, and the
grass seeds washed away;the seedling trees withered, and the
dead soil continued to wash from the desert and drift down to
fill the reservoir.
<p>
A root system is a really incredible thing. Many studies have
been made of its extent. In one study, a plant of winter rye
grass was grown for four months in a box with less than two
cubic feet of earth. In that time the plantgrew twenty inches
high, with about 51 square feet of surface above the ground. But
underground the root system had developed 378 miles of roots and
an additional6,000 miles of root hairs! This meant an average
growth of three miles of roots and 50 miles of root hairs for
each day of the four-month growing season. The growth rate
varies with different plants, of course, but this gives us some
idea of the activity that goes on under the surface of a quiet-
looking meadow, while the grass prepares food that will later
become milk and meat and butter for us.
<p>
But these growing roots are doing far more than just binding
together the rock particles that form the soil. They are taking
the first step toward creating an entirely new kind of soil.
<p>
A Flemish physician who lived in the 17th century gave an
interesting picture of this when he tried growing a willow spout
in a tub of earth. For five years nothing was added except
rainwater,and the willow grew into a small tree. At the end of
the five years the tree was weighed. It had gained more than 164
pounds in weight, while the soil in the tub had lost only two
ounces. Actually the soil weight must by now have included
millions of microscopic root hairs from the tree, but the
figures are accurate enough to show that those 164 pounds of
tree must have come from somewhere outside the soil.
<p>
If we divide up the plant into the various elements that form
its substance, we find that only five percent of its weight
comes originally from the soil. The elements in a mature corn
plant include carbon, 44.58 percent; oxygen, 43.79 percent;
hydrogen, 6.26 percent; nitrogen, 1.43 percent. These all come
originally from the air and water, and together they form more
than 95 percent of the plant. A good proportion of them comes to
the plant through the roots, by way of the soil, after earlier
plants have fitted the soil to receive them. the rest of the
plant, that which comes from the soil itself, includes
potassium, 1.62 percent; calcium, .59%; silicon, 54%; magnesium,
.44%; phosphorous, .25 percent; chlorine, .20 percent; sodium,
.15 percent; iron, .10 percent, and sulfur, .05 percent. Some
plants contain very small amounts of other elements, such as
copper, boron, and cobalt. These we call trace elements.
<p>
All these elements are built together into a living plant
through the agency of the chlorophyll, the green coloring matter
that is carried in the leaves. This building process is the
essentialfirst step that prepares the way for all the life that
exists on earth. Chlorophyll has not yet yielded to man all the
secrets, either of its composition or of the magic by which it
transforms inert building blocks into living material, but we do
know certain basic facts. The essential first step consists of
building sugar out of sunlight, carbon dioxide and water. This
is called photosynthesis (putting together). To make one
molecule of sugar the chlorophyll produces the union of six
molecules of water and six of carbon dioxide. With them it binds
the energy from the sunlight, and in the process six molecules
of free oxygen taken from the water and the carbon dioxide are
released into the air.
<p>
As the roots spread through the soil, they fill it with this new
living substance built from air, sunlight, and water. But this
has not yet become a part of the soil. It is not until the plant
itself dies that the dramatic change takes place in the soil.
For now the dead plant's roots and leaves offer food to the
small organisms that are among the most important factors in the
whole cycle of life, the bacteria, the molds, and the rest, most
of them too small for the eye to see.  Their most important
function lies in decomposing the remains of the higher plants
and animals, changing them into new chemical combinations that
can be used again by succeeding plant generations for food.
<p>
The decomposing plant attracts a host of small creatures that
help to break it up. Earthworms eat it, mixing it with the soil
particles that pass through their bodies, digesting the whole,
and casting it up on the surface, a revitalized and richer soil.
The number of earthworms in the soil depends largely on its
chemistry and on the amount of plant material they find in the
earth.
<p>
Myriads of small creatures spend parts of their lives in the
soil: ants, beetles, wasps, spiders, and many others. Some of
these come to eat the plants, and many meat eaters come to eat
the plant eaters. Among these the shrews and moles play a very
important part. In favorable locations there may be as many as
100 shrews to the acre, and each shrew may eat the equivalent of
its own weight in other living things each day. All this
activity combines to carry on the work of plowing, mixing, and
fertilizing as the creatures add their remains to the land.
<p>
This hive of living things in the soil, the eaters and the eaten
adds up to incredible numbers. The bacteria alone may range from
comparatively few up to three or four billion in a single gram
of dry soil. At the Rothamsted Experiment Station in England it
has been estimated that in good soil the bacterial matter,
living and dead, may weigh as much as 5,600 pounds per acre. At
the rate of even one billion to a gram of soil the total body
surfaceof the bacteria in an acre, if spread out flat, would
equal 460 acres.
<p>
The fungi may add up to a million in a gram of dry soil,
weighing over 1,000 pounds to the acre.
<p>
Each of these small living things adds its tiny bit to the
building of the living earth until, in the average acre of good
topsoil, with four-percent organic matter, there are stored
about 80,000 pounds of such organic matter from plants and
animals, containing energy from the sunlight equal to that in 20
to 25 tons of anthracite coal.
<p>
But while the soil lives, this stored-up energy is constantly
being used for food by the teeming life it supports and, as we
have seen, it must be constantly renewed by the plants in order
to maintain this life. For good soil is actually a living thing,
and its health is a matter of life and death to the plants and
animals that live on its surface. We ourselves are as dependent
on its health as the smallest of its creatures.

<h3><a name="part9">The Soil Responds</a></h3>
<p>
As the planet roots and fungi grow into the soil, tying its rock
particles together into a firm mass, opening the way for other
living things, and filling the earth with organic matter
containing packaged energy from the sunlight, a subtle change
occurs.
<p>
The root tips release carbon dioxide, the source of carbonic
acid. This reinforces the action of the rain, helping to
dissolve minerals from the soil particles, making them available
to the plants for food. As the bacteria decompose the dead plant
matter, they too release carbon dioxide and contribute their
share toward the enrichment of the soil. The decomposition of
animal and vegetable residues by microorganisms produces many
other acids besides carbonic acid, including citric, tartaric,
oxalic, and malic. Such acids are probably of even greater
importance in making minerals available.
<p>
In raw, unprepared soil these dissolved minerals might be
carried away by very heavy rain, and the supply left for the
plants would be rather precarious. But here the bacteria provide
another service, for in the decomposition process there are some
parts of the dead plants and animals that are more resistant
than others. These stay in the soil for a long time, forming a
dark, spongy, very absorbent material called humus. Humus stores
rainwater, with its dissolved minerals, holding both as a
reservoir for plants to draw on. It also stores minerals drawn
up from below by the deeper roots.
<p>
As the bacteria use up their food supply, billions of them die
of hunger or become inactive, and the life process in the soil
slows down until further stores of food are added by plants or
animals. As in most of nature's activities, this whole life
cycle in the soil becomes a self-regulating system--an organized
community, adjusting its numbers to the food supply so long as
it is undisturbed by outside forces.
<p>
On the surface this community may appear to be merely a blanket
of dead leaves and litter from last season, but under these lie
the decaying remains of their predecessors from earlier seasons.
As we go deeper these become mixed with soil particles and with
the roots of plants living and dead. Through this material run
myriads of passageways left by insects, mammals, and decayed
roots. The whole makes a perfect protection for the earth and a
sponge to check the runoff of rain, which it absorbs and
introduces slowly into the soil reservoir below.
<p>
This power of the organized topsoil to store water and minerals
is the key to the next step for the developing plant community.
<p>
For, while minerals form a very small part of the whole plant--
only one twentieth--that small fraction, together with sunlight,
is the key that makes the whole function. Several years ago this
was proved in some interesting tests in Kansas. In the western
part of that state where there is comparatively low rainfall,
the good earth was able to store most of the rain and the
dissolved minerals near the surface. But in the eastern part of
the state, the heavier rainfall supplied more water than the
soil could hold. Here a good share of the mineral solutions was
leached away. In a comparative analysis of wheat raised in the
eastern and western parts of the state, it was found that grain
raised in thedry western part contained nearly 50 percent more
protein than the same kind of wheat raised in the eastern part.
An important cause of this difference appears to lie in the
leaching of the eastern soil which, having lost a share of its
dissolved minerals, was unable to give the wheat a proper supply
of them.
<p>
Obviously the quality of the soil has a great effect on the
quality of the plant. And since animals, including man, require
roughly the same elements as plants, the health of man and the
lower animals must depend on the ability of the soil to supply
those needed elements in the right proportions.
<p>
From this experiment, it might seem that plants grow best in a
land where there is little rain. Actually, most food plants need
huge amounts of water. For example, a single corn plant uses
about 50 gallons in 100 days of growth. In one test, an acre of
corn containing 6,000 plants used 325,000 gallons of water in
100 growing days. This equaled the amount of water it would
havetaken to cover the acre 11 inches deep--or 11 acre inches.
<p>
To demonstrate the value of water, in an experiment in Utah some
corn was raised on dry land without irrigation. It produced 26
bushels per acre. On another plot the corn was irrigated with 15
acre inches of water. It produced 53 bushels to the acre, more
than double the other crop.
<p>
Hence, to raise a good crop of plants, the land must carry an
adequate supply of moisture. It must have the ability to store
it without leaching. To do so it must be well supplied with
humus built into it by the plants and small living creatures of
the soil. It is commonly estimated that nature may normally take
as long as 500 years to build an inch of topsoil.
<p>
<em>This topsoil is one of the keys to man's existence on
earth.</em>

<h3><a name="part10">The Forest Grows</a></h3>
<p>
As the tree draws in its raw materials from the air, water,
soil, and sunlight, these are carried to the leaves. Here,
through the miracle of chlorophyll, they are woven together and
transformed into sugar. And, from this sugar, into the vast
number of chemical combinations that form the living substance
of the tree--into roots and leaves and branches, into flowers
with their male and female parts that together produce seeds. In
the seeds are stored food and microscopic cells for the
production of new life. The cells will later develop, each one
producing its own assigned part of a new plant with vitamins,
enzymes, and other chemical combinations that interact to make
it function as a living thing.
<p>
Some soil fungi form a direct partnership with trees and other
plants. Beeches and pines apparently cannot make healthy growth
unless there exists an active association between their roots
and certain kinds of fungi. This partnership--or symbiotic
association--is known as mycorrhiza. Its exact function is
something of a mystery, but it evidently plays an important part
in the transfer of food from the soil to the root system.
<p>
One group of plants, the legumes--clovers, beans, locust trees,
and other pod bearers--joins forces with bacteria to form a sort
of chemical laboratory in the earth. When nature has built up
the soil's chemistry to a condition that will support them,
these legumes take their place in the plant community. They
offer a home in the soil to nitrogen-fixing bacteria that enter
their roots and cause them to swell into lumps called nodules,
where the bacteria live in colonies of many millions. Taking
their energy from the sugar in the plant roots, the bacteria
gather nitrogen from the air to form nitrogen compounds, which
they store in the nodules.
<p>
When the roots die, the nitrogen is left in the soil, and with
this enrichment the plant community bursts into full life.
<p>
Near Athens, Ohio, a plantation of cedar trees was set out on an
area of very poor soil by the U.S. Forest Service, who wanted to
test different trees in an effort to start a successful forest.
In one part of the cedar plantation they set out among the
cedars a number of locust trees (legumes), which carried the
nitrogen-fixing bacteria on their roots. Eleven years later the
cedar trees, planted alone, stood on the average about 30 inches
high, while those among the locusts averaged perhaps seven feet.
Between the small cedars the ground carried a thin, sickly cover
of low grass, an occasional white poplar, and very few other
plants. The soil was dry and offered little food or shelter for
living creatures. Here nature might need a century or more to
establish a healthy forest.
<p>
Under the locust-and-cedar combinations, however, one can step
across from a semi-desert into a rich young embryo natural
forest. The ground is covered with a lush growth of grasses,
weeds, and vines. On its surface a litter of dead leaves and
stems has begun to collect from plants of past seasons. Beneath
the litter the soil is cool and damp with moisture stored from
the rains. Shaded from the strong sunlight, it is a good natural
bed for the seeds of forest trees to make their start in. And
here are growing seedlings of tulip trees, red oak, red maple,
white ash, and others.
<p>
Both groups of trees were given an equal start on the same kind
of soil, and the entire area has been bombarded every year by
millions of seeds of many kinds, brought in by wind and bird and
mammal.
<p>
Why are the white poplars the only new trees to start among the
cedars? Why are there so few poplars under the taller cedar-and-
locust combination, while many other trees have started here
whose seeds failed to survive out in the open? The answer is
that each plant is a specialist, adapted by its own habit of
growth and its own special requirements for light and moisture
to grow best n its own preferred environment.
<p>
Among the cedars only the seedlings of the grasses and the
poplars have been able to withstand the drying heat of the
strong sunlight. Under the taller, richer, cedar-and-locust
growth the white poplars have had to meet the competition of red
oak, red maple, white ash, and tulip, whose seedlings thrive in
partial shade.
<p>
These trees are growing here, not because the ground received
any more of their seed, but because the seeds that fell found
the added moisture, soil quality, and just the amount of
protection from sunlight that they must have to get a secure
start in life.
<p>
This young forest will now follow the normal steps of forest
development; for the seedlings will eventually grow up to
overtop the earlier trees that nursed them and finally crowd
them out by robbing them of sunlight and the free space they
need for growth. And with the early trees will go many of the
small plants of the ground surface that also need sunlight.
<p>
For many years this slow development will continue, until the
crowding newcomers start to battle among themselves. At length
towering crowns will cut off the sunlight that their own
seedlings must have in order to live. Then they will have
destroyed their own power to reproduce. But among the many kinds
of seedlings now struggling in the forest shadows, there are
some that do thrive under these new conditions. Chief among them
are the hemlock, beech, and sugar maple. These will now outgrow
the others in their race to reach upward for the sunlight,
finally touching their tops against the forest canopy. Here they
will await their turn until a windstorm strikes some giant oak
or tulip to the ground, making room for one of the newcomers.
And at last these will take over to form the enduring climax
forest. They are now the dominant trees. Nothing else can
compete with them under the conditions they have established.
<p>
In some forests, where the soil is shallow, as the great trees
fall, one by one, tearing their spreading root systems out of
the shallow soil, the roots lift huge balls of earth with them.
In this process the ground is plowed up into a series of small
ridges and depressions that fill with water after rains or
melting snow. The water is held until it sinks slowly in the
ground, and thus has reinforced the absorption system already
established by humus and insects.
<p>
The trees have even made a new climate for all the lives that
exist under them. Near Cleveland, Ohio, measurements were taken
to compare the climate in a climax forest of this type with that
in an open field nearby. It was found that on a bright day there
was 750 times more light in the open field than in the forest.
The trees slowed down the speed of the wind until, 100 feet
inside the forest border, its velocity in summer was only one
tenth as much as in the open field. In winter, when the leaves
that slowed it had fallen, wind speed increased to one quarter
that in the field.
<p>
These differences influence the moisture in the forest; for the
wind and the sun's heat have a great effect on evaporation. It
was found in the Cleveland tests that average moisture
evaporation was 55 percent less in the forest than in the field
during the summer, and 38 percent less in the winter.
<p>
With its blanket of humus and its protection from chilling
winds, the forest soil is guarded against freezing in the
winter, while the branches shade the snow against rapid melting.
The soil is always ready to receive the water from the slowly
melting snow, while the surface of the hard-frozen field nearby
sheds the snow water like a roof, as it floods off under the
warmth of the spring sun.
<p>
So, in addition to building timber and providing environment for
many kinds of plants and animals, the forest also builds a
reservoir to catch and store the huge amounts of water it must
have for growth. From this reservoir, springs break out and
brooks slowly cut their channels and bring life-giving water to
land outside the forest.
<p>

<h3><a name="part11">The Forest Community</a></h3>
<p>
Our growing community of plants now provides three essentials
needed by other forms of life: shelter, water and a dependable
supply of food. Many forms of plant eaters now come to use it:
insects, mammals, birds and other creatures.
<p>
Here, for example, is a caterpillar busily transforming the
organic substance of a leaf into the juices and organs that make
up the parts of a caterpillar. Eventually this substance will go
through a series of further changes until at last it turns into
a flying insect. Then it will repay with interest the damage it
has done to the plant, for it becomes a partner in the plant's
life process, carrying pollen to fertilize the blossoms. Insects
make possible the continued existence of many plants.
<p>
Nearly all the fruits and vegetables used by man are directly
dependent on this partnership with insects. But this partnership
requires the most exacting regulation to meet two fundamental
laws of nature on which all life is based.
<p>
First, insects, like all living things, must have the power to
multiply faster than their normal death rate to insure against
the catastrophes of disease and weather. Without this insurance
no species could survive.
<p>
But this power carries with it tremendous danger; for insects,
if allowed to multiply unchecked, would soon destroy all the
leaves and kill all the plants that support them. We can see
that danger most clearly in the life of soil bacteria, the
smallest and simplest of all living things. One of these
invisible cells may seem like a very insignificant part of the
living community. But watch its numbers grow.
<p>
Each individual multiplies by dividing into two complete new
ones. Under favorable conditions this may happen about twice
each hour. Even if it happened but once each hour, and if each
one lived, the offspring from a single individual would number
17,000,000 in 24 hours. By the end of six days the 17,000,000
would have increased to a bulk larger than the earth, and every
living thing on earth would have become engaged in a suffocating
struggle for food and air and life.
<p>
The useful bacteria, when kept in their place make possible the
higher forms of life, would have turned into irresistible
destroyers. The same principle, of course, applies to all forms
of life. The insects that pollinate the blossoms are no
exception.
<p>
To control them, nature uses a highly organized police force of
flesh eaters: bacteria, insects, mammals and birds, each one a
specialist designed for a particular role to which it is best
adapted.
<p>
For example, in this small community we are watching, the larvae
of many insects spend parts of their lives in the upper soil.
Shrews hunt them under the leaf mold. Other insects and some of
the molds and bacteria also feed on them. On the surface many
ground-nesting birds, such as the towhee, turn up the leaves to
find them. The brown thrasher hunts here too and continues the
search among the bushes where it makes its nest. It is joined by
the warblers and vireos, which extend theirsearch up to the tree
tops.
<p>
As the trees grow larger and their lower branches die, the fungi
may decompose and soften the wood in the knotholes, offering
favorable nesting sites for woodpeckers and nuthatches, whose
feet are adapted for hunting on the bark oftree trunks. The
woodpeckers go one step further, drilling holes through the bark
to catch the insects hidden within.
<p>
Some of the insect pupae that survive this  search emerge to fly
over the tree tops, but here they are met by the swifts and
swallows by day, by the nighthawks at dusk, and later by the
bats that are equipped with nature's radar systems to hunt in
the darkness. Each one of these controlling predators must in
turn hold its own place against others that are larger or
stronger or more active: hawks, owls, foxes, weasels.
<p>
It may seem a haphazard collection of predators and prey.
Actually it has evolved into a very highly organized,
beautifully controlled form of community government, with its
own automatic system of farming, pedigree breeding, sanitation,
policing and insurance.
<p>
There may be many niches in the forest that give shelter for a
nest or a den, but their inhabitants can survive only if the
surrounding territory can offer enough food to support life.
They can rear their families and multiply onlyif they can find
the added food to feed their young, and many young birds and
animals require the equivalent of their own weight in meat or
insects each day.
<p>
As the growing families move out to forage for themselves, they
find the best hiding places occupied, the best feeding areas
already in use. They are then more exposed to their enemies. The
first to tire or weaken in the search for food becomes the
easiest prey. In this way nature removes the unlucky and the
weaklings, saving in the long average the best, hardiest, or
quickest to learn, to live and to carry on their kind. Thustheir
population is adjusted to the number that the land can safely
support.
<p>
Sometimes a predator species may be wiped out for a time by
weather or disease. But nature carries insurance against such
catastrophes, for the area patrolled by each species will
slightly overlap that of its neighbors. For example, if the
ground-dwelling towhee disappears, the thrasher, the shrew, and
the white-footed mouse all are ready to step in to reap the more
abundant food supply and, with more plentiful food, to rear
larger families.
<p>
This local police organization is backed up by a more mobile
patrol force; for the larger predators, requiring more food,
must manage to cover more ground than their smaller prey, taking
off the season's increase wherever it is easiest to catch. They
concentrate on areas of heaviest production.
<p>
In this hierarchy of life some creatures may fall prey to
smaller predators, the disease germs that attack them from
within or the parasites from without: the worms that live in
their bodies, for example, or the fleas and lice living on their
skins. As a rule, these take only a small share of the daily
product of energy from their host, for the body of a healthy
animal can usually control such parasites. But when the host is
weakened by hunger or age, the parasites may prove fatal. Then
the sanitary agents of the community step in to do their share.
Vultures eat the dead flesh, bacteria and the larvae of flies
feed in it and decompose it. Burying beetles carry its remains
underground to enrich the soil, laying the foundation for a new
cycle of life on a cleansed surface.
<p>
So the living community in the forest grows, the plants drawing
in elements from air and water, and energy from the sun,
building them into life--the plant eaters staying near their
stationary food supply, turning its energy intomeat, passing
this on to the larger, more mobile flesh eaters. These in turn
pass on their energy to the hierarchy of larger forms, each
group in its turn becoming fewer in number as the larger
creatures require more small bodies to feed them, with each
successive individual forced to cover the larger area of ground
needed to raise these many smaller lives. But in the end even
the largest succumb to the bacteria and beetles that complete
the circle inthe earth.
<p>
All these creatures live and flourish completely unaware that
they owe their existence to a few hundred million invisible
bacteria living in the roots of some locust trees that pioneered
the way for them many years ago.

<h3><a name="part12">The Community Through the Seasons</a></h3>
<p>
Throughout the ages of its existence the fortunes of the great
forest community are constantly fluctuating under the influence
of four fundamental forces and a host of lesser ones. The long-
range cycles of weather, the cycles of disease and prosperity
among member groups, and the resulting changes in the influence
of these groups on each other, all play a major part in the
existence of a whole community. But the changing seasons of the
year have the most obvious effect.
<p>
In winter the plants of the northern climates rest from their
function of producing food, and all the creatures of the forest
must adjust their lives to a reduced food supply. Most of the
birds go south. Many animals such as the chipmunks, woodchucks,
skunks, snakes, and frogs, and many insects, retire for a long
sleep during the winter. Those that remain active must depend on
food stored up from the summer's harvest.
<p>
The ruffed grouse and cardinal will find it stored in the seeds,
fruits, and buds of trees and bushes. The nuthatch finds the
eggs of the insects hidden in the bark of trees. Woodpeckers
drill through the bark to find the insect larvae that winter
beneath it. The red squirrel, flying squirrel, and gray squirrel
live on stored seeds and nuts. Perhaps the most active and
numerous animals of the forest are the white-footed mice and the
shrews, and in them we see a good example of interdependence.
The mice live on their stores of seeds and on what insects they
can find hidden in winter retreats, while the shrews hunt day
and night, digging tunnels through soil and humus and through
rotting logs to capture the mice as well as great numbers of
insects.
<p>
These mammals and birds in their turn offer food to the fox, the
weasel, and the barred owl, which of course can exist only in
smaller numbers, since for their support they require so many of
the lesser creatures.
<p>
As the snow melts and the suns of March and April warm the
ground, a change comes over the forest. The low plants on the
earth's surface come to life. The early insects come out of
hiding and many more hatch to take advantage of the new supply
of food. The skunk, the chipmunk, and several kinds of snakes,
toads, and frogs wake from their winter sleep, and all include
in their varied diets great numbers of insects. Now the ground
grows bright with spring flowers-spring beauties, yellow
adder's-tongue, hepatica, trillium, and many others. The flower
buds of the elms and red maples offer food for gray squirrels.
Frogs add their music to the notes of birds returning from their
winter in the south. For now nature's food factory has begun
again to build new life from sunlight, air, and water. The green
algae in the pools, the forest plants, shrubs, and trees are all
doing their share, offering their stores of energy to the
creatures that come to feed on them. And the creatures respond.
Insects of different kinds attack every part of every tree and
plant--buds and blossoms, leaves and bark and wood. Spiders and
predatory insects feed on these plant eaters, and all are in
turn preyed on by the larger animals, including snakes and
frogs, and by waves of migrating birds that spread up from the
South to find nesting sites and hunting grounds to support their
hungry young.
<p>
Many of these birds stop merely for a rest and a meal and hurry
on to find summer homes farther north. Others stay to fill every
available niche in the forest and, as the leaves unfold, the
branches that yesterday were bare and inhospitable, now offer
shelter from weather and predators.
<p>
By summer's end, conditions began to change again for our forest
community. Much of the tree and plant growth had stopped,
providing less appetizing food for insects. Their own time of
greatest multiplication had passed. The birds begin to move
south again.
<p>
By the beginning of October the last of the summer birds have
gone, and now the forest is filled by great waves of southward-
bound migrant birds coming down from the north, stopping to feed
onwild grapes and on the fruits and berries of many trees and
bushes. They vary this diet with beetles, grubs, and other
insects, which they dig out from under dead leaves.
<p>
By early November most of the leaves have fallen and the bare
tree tops again admit light to the forest floor. The robins and
thrushes continue southward. Bobwhites may come in from the
fields to gather beechnuts in the woods.Tracks in the early
snows of late November tell of the search for food by squirrels,
cottontail rabbits, red fox, white-footed mouse, and short-
tailed shrew.
<p>
Thus, in every forest the living creatures that make up the
community are actually selected by the dominant trees and the
lesser plants that determine the environment in which they must
live.  From this we see that the forest is a great organization
made up of many separate and indispensable parts.  Some of these
parts may appear to be harmful to its life.  But in most cases
the degree of harm or value will depend on the perfection of the
control or balance that the different members achieve among
themselves.
<p>
Owing to the hazards of climate and disease, this balance is
never quite achieved, and its fluctuations play an important
part in forest life.  And on the degree of its attainment will
depend on the amount of life that the land can support, in other
words its carrying capacity.  It is interesting to note how this
principle is applied by nesting birds in the forest where each
air selects and defends enough territory to support its family.
But this defense is exerted only against members of the same
species, while nests of other, non-competing species might be
tolerated in the same tree.

<h3><a name="part13">The Functioning of the Whole</a></h3>
<p>
There is much still unknown about the proper management of
watersheds, and since the conditions on each will vary with soil
and slope, climate and vegetation, the management required on
them may differ widely. But in every case the first requirement
is to protect the soil, which is nature's reservoir for storing
water where it falls.
<p>
So, we see the river and the lands of its watershed as a great
living organism, with its heart in the mountains that supply its
life blood. This blood flows out through the streams that form
the arteries above ground and below, coming down from a hundred
thousand hidden sources--the mountain springs and meadows, the
patches or moist woodland with the porous soil beneath them, the
shaded snow banks and the afternoon thunderstorms, the flow of
every raindrop held back by the delaying stems of grass and
flowers, absorbed by bits of rotting wood, filtering into the
soil through a million root tunnels and worm holes, delayed, but
slowly moving down the hillside through the silt, tobring a
steady, even flow of life to the great functioning body of
civilization in the valley.
<p>
Every action that affects the lands of the watershed has its
direct influence on the functioning of the whole organism. The
growing leaf that shades the snow to delay its melting is doing
its microscopic share to give an even flow of water through the
summer. Combining its influence with a hundred billion other
leaves, it may determine the success or failure of the harvest
in the valley.
<p>
We may see and appreciate the devastation caused on the
watershed by a carelessly dropped cigarette. But what of the
sheep whose hoof compresses a worm hole or destroys the
protecting grass rootson the hillside? Nature may repair these
tiny bits of damage if they are kept within limits with which
she can cope. But when too many sheep combine to lay a hillside
bare, they set the stage for rivers filled with siltand for next
season's floods and droughts over huge areas of distant lands.
<p>
The people who use the watershed hold in their hands the lives
and well-being of the millions who depend on it. Every action
that affects the health of the watershed becomes a matter of
vital concern to those millions and to all the communities of
plants and animals that together make up the whole.
<p>
And so we see that every community may be divided into four
parts: first, its members with their immediate environment;
second, the distant and unknown lands that send out their
influence by stream and wind, by wing and padded foot to affect
the local environment; third, the actions of men whose influence
spreads out to affect in some way nearly every community living
on the earth; and last, but most important, those influences
that mold the minds of men, giving them the incentives to wise
or unwise actions; for in the end these lie at the very center
of earth's great web of life. To support this web, the soil must
be maintained alive and functioning.
