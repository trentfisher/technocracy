<hr>
In Southwestern Oregon you can look almost anywhere and see
reddish brown conifers, signifying a spread of disease and
insect infestation. Aerial surveys measure the death of these
trees.
<p>
Knowledge of our forest ecosystem is disgracefully low. With
more emphasis placed on managing money rather than on learning
about the important part nature plays in their lives, most
children grow up showing little interest in science.
<p>
A recent headline in the New York Times News Service reads:
<em>TEACH KIDS THE VALUE OF MONEY. </em>Then the writer says:
"...Children must learn to earn, spend, save, borrow and invest
if they are to function as adults..." By the time today's
children grow up, attention to the importance of money and skill
in how to make it work best for them may have been the cause of
eliminating the remaining forest ecosystem for their future.
<p>
Some component of science should be a required subject. If
earlier generations of children had been taught the importance
of preserving our forests: how they replenish our underground
wells, streams and rivers by passing rainwater to them through
an intricate root system; how their protective canopy prevents
snow from melting all at once, distributing it gradually so it
isn't wasted in floods; how forest streams preserve spawning
grounds for fish; how the trees cool the atmosphere; how our
forests hold topsoil in a firm grip, preventing it from washing
or blowing away; how it protects wildlife, providing nourishment
and sanctuary--perhaps we would have healthy forests today.
<p>
In 1948 Aldo Leopold wrote: "We abuse land because we regard it
as a commodity belonging to us. When we see land as a community
to which we belong, we may begin to use it with love and
respect. There is no other way for land to survive the impact of
mechanized man, nor for us to reap from it the esthetic harvest
it is capable, under science, of contributing to culture."
