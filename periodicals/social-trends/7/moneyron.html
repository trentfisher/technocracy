<p>
The Bible says that the love of money is the
root of all evil.  Professor Soddy defined money as the nothing
one gets for something before anyone can get anything.
<p>
Money was invented as a convenience when trade became too
complex for barter.  It is an abstraction of real wealth, a
promise to pay on demand to the bearer the full value.  It
represents real wealth in a more convenient form.  Money,
therefore, is a medium of exchange.  As such it must have
certain properties.  It can't be used for anything else, and the
total amount should remain quite stable.  This is the reason for
the selection of precious metals and stones.  Consider, for
instance, the use of an item of real value, such as water.
Water is almost as easily lost as it is gained.  If money fell
from the sky rather than having to be earned by exchange for the
fruits of human endeavor, human endeavor would no longer be in
demand and it alone is the source of all true wealth.  Although
the value of water is without question, using it as money is
impossible.  With that settled, at least we no longer have to
worry about a mass exodus from California, Florida, and Arizona.
<p>
Monetary value is established by scarcity, demand, the amount of
human labor required to produce it and the cost of the
materials.  The price of air cannot be calculated; it is too
abundant.  Does this mean it is worthless?  Hardly!  On the
other hand the price of wooden, artistically designed, hand-
crafted garbage cans would probably be quite high and the demand
for them infinitesimal.  If any were to be produced, the price
would have to be nearly zero to move them and those buying them
would probably find some other use for them.  It must be noted
that virtually all that makes life worth living cannot be given
a price:  love, beauty, or the capacity to enjoy the things that
money can buy.  We describe something of great value as being
"priceless", a treasure without bounds.
<p>
Ideally, the price of goods would be determined by auction.  The
stock market and the commodity futures market are good examples.
Many items do not, and cannot, fit such an idea.  The price of
locomotives, paper-making machines, and aircraft carriers are
certainly not determined by auction.
<p>
What does the price of an item represent?  It is simply an
agreement between the buyer and seller, nothing more.  Money,
obviously, is not even a measure of value.  The price of goods
is a measure of an almost limitless number of variables.  To
make matters even more interesting, the computation of these
variables is different for different types of goods.  Price is
also a function of time.  The price of a case of ripe bananas
will decline as a function of time.  In six months it might
become negative.  In other words you would have to pay someone
to take it away.
<p>
Small wonder that economic analysis based on monetary measures
of economic activity fails so miserably.  Economics can be
referred to as science only in the lightest of terms.  The
Science of Economics is sort of a standing joke.  The reason is
that its practitioners are using a rubber band for a ruler.
Under such circumstances it is surprising they function as well
as they do.  Technocracy Inc. proposed that energy be made the
measure of economic activity.  Nothing can be moved or
transformed without an expenditure of energy.
<p>
As money is an abstract representation of wealth, it can be
further abstracted itself.  This probably first took the form of
a check stating that the bearer had a certain amount of gold on
deposit in a vault.  This was later formalized into paper
currency--a more convenient form representing a given amount of
gold.  Paper money was so much more convenient than gold that
nearly everyone left their money in bank vaults.  The bankers
realized that no one really knew how much gold the bank held and
that as long as no one knew, the bank could get away with
issuing more paper money than the bank really had gold backing
it.  From this little deception, the banks learned that what
they really wanted was to own debt in the form of loans on which
interest could be charged.  A bank with nothing but money is a
poor bank.
<p>
The next step in this fictitious little game is to get rid of
gold as backing for the paper money; after all, someone might
want it.  The banks became convinced of the danger of gold-
backed currency during the depression of the 1930s when this is
exactly what happened.  Credit cards and electronic banking have
added a new dimension to the abstraction.  Now not even currency
is necessary.  Credits and debits are entered automatically in
digital data files with interest automatically added or deducted
as required.

<a name="part2">Credits</a> and debits are entered automatically in
digital data
files with interest automatically added or deducted as required.
This situation has generated some interesting aberrations.
Although gold itself was no more than an abstraction of real
wealth, it at least was a physical substance that no amount of
juggling of books could produce or destroy.  The new money
(paper) can be much more easily manipulated and electronic
banking makes even this manipulation invisible.
<p>
Paper money can be printed much more easily than gold can be
mined.  Well!  This is very nice!  Now it is possible to produce
wealth by just turning on the printing presses.  But wait a
minute!  We haven't increased the amount of physical wealth,
just the amount of money to buy it.  With more money available
to purchasers, the price of the goods is just bid up to the
level required to absorb the additional money run off on the
presses.  This is called inflation.  With more money available,
old debts now become easier to repay.  The banks are, of course,
on to this aspect and simply adjust interest rates to allow for
the inflation rate plus profit.  Purchasers of such things as
long-term bonds can find themselves with a negative profit.
This, of course, reduces the desire to buy such things.  But on
the whole, a little inflation seems to be a good thing.  Those
who benefit from it are happy; those who don't benefit appear
not to understand the situation well enough to complain.  It
could also be argued that if no inflation existed, little money
could be made from financial manipulation.  The only way to add
to one's own personal wealth would be by adding physical wealth
or improving productivity.
<p>
If a little inflation is good, a lot must be great!  Right?
There are many examples in recent history of the chaos that is
caused by the hyperinflation of a nation's currency.  A
hyperinflation means that money rapidly becomes worthless as the
quantity of it available becomes increasingly abundant.  People
who have money try to trade it for almost everything that will
maintain its value.  This can include anything from gold to
toilet paper.  When no one wants the money any more, currency
collapses.  It no longer is a medium of exchange but the
equivalent to junk.
<p>
If money is withdrawn from circulation, the reverse of
inflation, or deflation, occurs.  This most frequently happens
when banks become nervous due to excessive outstanding loans or
too many defaults are occurring on existing loans.  If the
banks' own checks bounce or no money is there to cover
depositors' demands, a run on the banks may happen, forcing them
into bankruptcy.  Money is tight.  Loans are difficult to get
and interest rates are high.  At this point many things begin to
happen.  People who have invested in inflation by buying a
house, for instance, with the idea of quick resale and profit
suddenly find that loans are not available to potential buyers.
Companies dependent on loans to remain in business begin closing
their doors.  Businesses that had planned to expand defer those
plans.  And all businesses try to make their operations more
efficient so they can cut their prices and hopefully stay afloat
in a shrinking market.
<p>
All of these vicissitudes have one thing in common--they hurt.
It can be argued that this helps to keep people sharp and on the
move.  This is something like learning not to sit in the road by
getting run over by a truck.  It works, but there must be a
better way.
<p>
<a name="part3">Social consequences:</a>
Nearly all ideological disputes revolve
around the distribution of money or wealth.  The world seems
divided into two camps.  One camp believes that the individual
is responsible for his own happiness and comfort.  The other
believes that society should be responsible for the welfare of
the individual.  In practice, neither side seems to fully accept
its own teachings.  Both have many shortcomings.
<p>
The capitalistic societies of the west operate more efficiently
than the socialist societies of the east but are quite ruthless
regarding the human values of those who do the work.  The profit
made off workers is the only "bottom line" that counts.  While
on the other end of the production line, the criteria is, "Let
the buyer beware."  It is less of a social organization than a
large collection of competing pressure groups, all vying for
more money, power, or whatever.  The streets and prisons are
cluttered with the human debris that could not adjust or adapt
to society's requirements. One of the largest and fastest
growing professions is the legal profession.  This is not a
record of a happy society.
<p>
The application of technology and energy to the social system is
destroying the price system by destroying all the properties
that price is based on.  As has been noted, price can be placed
on only those items that are the result of human labor.  Also,
as the quantity of product reaches or exceeds demand, price
approaches zero.  Thus our technological motion attacks the
price system at the two most fundamental requirements for its
maintenance: scarcity and input of human labor.  The movement to
a new stage in human social evolution is inexorable and
unstoppable unless we decide to cancel the planet with our
nuclear weapons.
<p>
Technocracy has proposed the institution of a system of energy
accounting for each item produced on a continent-wide basis.
Goods and services would be distributed without cost because a
price system can no longer be maintained.  Efficiency would be
maintained and advanced by energy balance analysis.
<p>
Technocracy is not an ideology.  It is not a value judgment of
the proper disposition of financial resources that includes one
group and excludes another.  Technocracy is an analysis of the
resolution of our present social difficulties.
