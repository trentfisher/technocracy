Our present society is heading toward a fascist social
system as our wartime economy indicates.  Many
short-sighted persons believe that war is good for the
economy.  War pulls nations out of depressions.  They
don't take into consideration that after the war is
over, civilizations are thrown back into more severe
recessions as new technology, developed to help win the
war (if wars are ever won) continues to be used in
peacetime conditions.  War proves as nothing else does
our ability to develop new technology quickly for travel
expediency, precise death weapons, instant communication
systems, etc.  So profitable has the war industry become
for some people that these beneficiaries of war
economics want to keep a good thing going.
<P>
Washington State is one of the military oases of the
nation.  Washington State employs more military
personnel than almost any other part of the nation.  In
Puget Sound, military preparation and production are
conducted on land, on the sea, and beneath the sea,
assembling the mightiest war machine on earth.  In
Bangor, WA is the Trident Submarine Base.  At the
University of Washington 100 engineers inquire daily
into subtleties of undersea warfare.  The late Senator
"Scoop" Jackson was known in Washington D.C. as the
"senator from Boeing", the sixth-largest defense
contractor.  There is the cruise missile lab in Kent and
Lockheed Shipyards in Seattle.  Then there is the
"nuclear culture" residing in Hanford where the football
players proudly display mushroom clouds on their helmets
and where streets and places of business, entertainment
and education are named after nuclear weapons and their
consequences.  There isn't room here to cover all the
establishments that touch on war profit in the state of
Washington.
<P>
An effort to stampede the country into war in 1916 by
the Wilson administration brought this comment from a
minister in a New England munitions town:  "The war is a
godsend to this community."  (From Revolution in
Seattle, Harvey O'Connor.
<P>
Shortly after the U.S. detonated the first H-bomb in
1954, News and World Report in a state of euphoria
glorified the H-bomb as a boon to business "a long
period...of big orders.  In the years ahead the affects
of the new bomb will keep on increasing.  As one
appraiser puts it:  'The H-bomb has blown Depression
thinking right out the window.'"
<P>
The short-sightedness of this type of thinking should be
cause for alarm in every conscious citizen.  Hitler
pulled Germany out of a depression with his military
buildup, but what good is a product if you don't use it?
So these mindless leaders create reasons for war.  And
once more Germany is facing a serious depression.  In
fact, one out of every 10 Europeans is out of work. 
Living standards are dropping for the first time in 30
years.
<p>
In the five years ending in 1986, taxpayers will
contribute a healthy share toward a $1.5 trillion
military buildup.  Starting in the year 2100 B.C. and
spending $1 million every day right up to this moment,
you still will not have spent as much as the United
States is slated to spend on armaments between 1981 and
1986 A.D.  
<P>
Seth Neddermeyer, a former Manhattan Project scientist
told Dean Paton, Seattle Post Intelligencer, on May 1,
1983, that "possibilities for world survival are limited
because corruption of research by the military pervades
all branches of science."  He further stated that "Our
foreign policy is like a three-year-old kid; aggressive
as hell.  We're not learning from the Holocaust, from
the bombings of the Japanese, from anything.  We're
still in a wartime economy."
<P>
Definition of fascism according to Webster's 1983 New
Twentieth Century Dictionary:  A system of government
characterized by rigid one-party dictatorship, forcible
suppression of the opposition (unions, other parties,
especially leftist,  minority groups, etc.),  the
retention of private ownership of the means of
production under centralized governmental control,
belligerent nationalism and racism, and glorification of
war.  
<P>
..... As a nation, how near are we to fitting this
definition?
