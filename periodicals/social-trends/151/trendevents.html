<P>
While the sky is not about to fall, and the world is not coming to an
end, what the nations of the world have done over the years to this one
and only Earth could bring catastrophic consequences.  The rate of the
exploitation and the wasteful consumption of the world's natural
resources and the damage done to the land and the ecoenvironmental
habitat has put humankind's survival in the balance.  Unless this
insatiable consumption of the Earth's already depleted resource base and
aimless growth and development are checked and drastically reduced to
the essential requirements and limitations as to the carrying capacity
of a geographical region, the eventual demise of modern civilization
will become a reality.
<P>
While all nations throughout the world are guilty of the wasteful and
careless use of their natural resources, the United States stands out
among nations as one of the most prolific in the devastation and
extravagant use of its natural resources.  For a continental area that
was once endowed with one of the greatest array of natural resources,
the United States has shown a wanton disregard for the preservation of
the country's natural resource heritage during most of its history.
<P>
Although not on the scale of the destruction that took place during
the great westward movement, there was a considerable amount of damage
done to the natural resources during the early history of the country. 
The development with its haphazard waste took place with scarcely any
consideration of the consequences.  Forests cleared for farmland were
merely piled up and burned.  The soils were overcropped, pasture lands
overgrazed, fish and game wasted.  Hunters killed moose and deer for
just a small souvenir and to demonstrate their prowess.  The loss of the
natural resources was shameful.
<P>
It took a long time before appreciation of conservation and
wiser use of natural resources caught on during the early history of
the country.  It was not until some of the larger cities, such as Boston
and Philadelphia, began to experience a shortage of easily available
timber that the importance in the use of the forest reserves was
realized.  But these early pioneers and guardians of America's natural
resources probably had no conception of the magnitude of the pillage and
plunder of the resources that was to come as the country expanded and
the mass of people trekked across the vast land and wide open spaces
beyond the Appalachians.
<P>
<H3>THE BIG LAND GIVEAWAY AND THE MANIFEST DESTINY CONQUEST</H3>
<P>
After the adoption of the Constitution, the states ceded to the
federal government nearly all of the claims to the land beyond their
borders.  Thus the first of the public domain of the United States
consisted of most of the land between the original states and the
Mississippi River, except Kentucky, Vermont and part of Tennessee. 
Other vast territories were acquired by the Louisiana Purchase, conquest
from Mexico, the Oregon Compromise, and the purchase of Alaska. And
smaller areas were purchased from Spain, Texas and Mexico.  As for the
original Americans, the Indians, the ``Winning of the West'' turned out to
be the most pitiful and disgraceful episode in the history of the United
States.  The Indians considered themselves as part of the land and all
life around them; the concept of owning property and the land was alien
to their way of life and culture.
<P>
As long as profits were to be made, how the land was to be used was
of no concern to the land grabbers and speculators.  Even some of the
founding fathers of the country recognized the financial potential in
the disposal of large blocks of undeveloped lands. Putting his surveyor
experience to good use, George Washington bought and sold unoccupied
land in New York, Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Kentucky with very good
results, leaving an estimate of more than $5,000,000.  Many government
officials at the time, and later, likewise took advantage of the
opportunity for gain and profit.
<P>
Alexander Hamilton, and a number of financiers, considered the buying
and selling of public lands as a lucrative venture as well as a
good source to raise federal revenues.  And from their sale a
much-needed source of revenue to pay the salaries of government
officials and the interest on the debts accrued by the government.
<P>
By the time the first homestead law was passed in 1862, most of the
accessible land had already been disposed of by sale or grant.  The
chief method for the disposal and apportioning of public domain reveals
that 35 percent of the alienated land was sold; about 27 percent was
disposed under the homestead laws; about 22 percent was granted to the
states for the purpose of providing aid to education and for other
purposes; and 9 percent was given to aid railroad development, most of
which went directly to the railroad corporations and the railroad
barons.  The railroads not only received the land but the mineral rights
that went with it.  In return, the railroads were to transport
government freight at a reduced rate.  From the homestead laws, slightly
more than a billion acres of the country's public domain became private
and state property.
<P>
Even before and during the time of homesteading, and the dividing of
the land by the government, exploitation and greed prevailed without any
regard to conservation and the future needs of the country. This was the
rule.  One of the most favored and endowed 2,000,000,000 square miles of
the entire Earth was there for the taking, spread out before the
pioneers crossed the Appalachian Mountains.  The shortcomings in land
utilization and the distribution of the land created a lack of
understanding of the best use of the land.  Land management did not
exist.
<P>
Homesteading was done by dummies so that stockmen could monopolize
large tracts of grazing land and control available water supplies. 
Timber land was homesteaded merely for the purpose to sell it to some
lumber company.  Many homesteaders obtained more land than they were
entitled to, sometimes under assumed names, or where the claims to the
deed were turned over to another person for a fee.  It was common for a
homesteader to sell his land to an adjoining settler because it could
not support a family.  In a semiarid region, several hundred acres were
required, on the average, to support the needs of a family.  Most of the
land granted by the federal government to the states was promptly sold,
often to members of the legislature or their friends, many of whom
resold the land at large profits.  The funds received from the sale of
state lands were used to reduce the tax burdens of the state and pay the
salaries of the legislators.
<P>
After the Civil War, the great westward movement was facilitated by
the development of the railroads, and encouraged by the homestead laws
when hundreds of thousands of people moved into the prairie and the
Eastern Great Plains.  The railroad tycoons and other vested interests
with their underhanded methods and schemes did everything they could to
put a favorable spin on making the people think that homesteading was
the answer to their dreams.  Bringing immigrants from mostly Europe and
giving them citizenship was part of the overall program to settle the
Midwestern and western part of the United States.  As the towns and
cities were built, and the farmers needed the railroads to ship their
crops to other areas in the country and to market, it would become a
bonanza for the railroad speculators and other special interests.
<P>
The grants to aid the building of railroads during the Great Western
movement totaled about 132,000,000 acres, about 38,000,000 acres given
to the railroads, mostly in those states bordering the Mississippi
River.  As the railroads were being built across the country, other
states granted some 94,000,000 acres to the railroad industry.  No
private business was treated more generously than the railroad
corporations; the railroad magnates had everything going their way, and
great fortunes were being made.
<P>
The sale of public land yielded only small sums, only $60 million
during the first half century of the nation's history, and approximately
$160 million during the second half century, and a total in 1938 of
about only $250 million.  Most of the land sold by the federal
government brought only a small fraction of what it was worth.  The
choicest timber lands brought no more than $2.50 an acre, and the
average was only 60 cents an acre.  Likewise the grants in aid of
internal improvements and development yielded results that were
disappointing in many ways.  For example, the 350,000 acres granted to
Wisconsin in aid of the state university brought less than $600
thousand.
<P>
The failure of sales and grants to bring hoped-for results gave
credence to the idea that the public domain would be more valuable
toward making more homes affordable for the growing population.  And the
taxes paid by the property owners would provide a main financial source
to the local and state governments.  Congressmen and other officials
figured that it was desirable to dispose of the land so cheaply or in a
way that would encourage rapid settlement, growth and development.  The
strong and rugged individualism by the generations of pioneer and
frontier life, added to the emphasis put on real estate, strengthened
the concept that private enterprise was better than public ownership. 
There was little concern about how the public land was to be used
or how to conserve it for posterity. 
<P>
<H3>VOICES IN THE WILDERNESS</H3>
<P>
While there were any number of early pioneers and leaders in the
conservation movement, none was any more concerned about the gutting of
the continent and the wanton destruction of the country's natural
resources than Charles R. Van Hise (1851-1918) and his associates.  Hise
came up with the idea of the necessity of a plan or program that would
provide greater care and responsibility in the utilization of the
country's natural resources.  Hise also proposed that the country and
the government implement or put in place a program for the purpose of
determining the rate of the destruction of the land and other natural
resources that have resulted from the haphazard occupation and
development that was taking place in the country.
<P>
To make a survey and an inventory of the natural resources of the
country and the rate they were being used would, quite obviously,
require the expertise in specialized fields--such as in geology,
geography, forestry, hydrology, engineering and scientists that could
make an accurate estimate to this most important and urgent undertaking.
The purpose of the survey and the inventory of the country's resources
was to provide the necessary information for the implementation of a
program to prevent any further destruction of the nation's resources and
to put in place a comprehensive and sustainable natural resource
program. Had Hise's idea been executed, it would have provided a
long-term utilitarian policy for the nation instead of the present
short-term arbitrary expediencies and palliatives that negate any binding
restrictions or limitations on the use of the country's fast dwindling
natural resources.
<P>
While Hise's far-sighted ideas received some acceptance and minor
conservation measures were taken, the magnitude and the momentum to
settle and conquer the vast land area from the Atlantic to the Pacific
became an unstoppable obsession as the government and the special vested
interests encouraged and supported the conquest of the west.  Nothing of
consequence was done to prevent the denuding of the land and protecting
the environmental and natural habitat.
<P>
Little effort was made to use and leave the Midwestern prairie in its
original condition.  In the plains and foothills there were wild
scrambles to graze every blade of grass, not even leaving enough for
winter grazing or for seeding.  The grasslands (big bluestein reached
10-19 feet high) were destroyed or damaged by burning, over-grazing,
mowing too close or too late in the season, plowing and cultivating,
irrigating or flooding, and lowering the water table by artificial
drainage and overuse.  It was as if the grass and the soil were free
just for the taking.  ``Get it while the getting is good.''  The nurturing
of the soil and the plants, the importance to maintain a balance in
nature was not understood or the main concern of the settlers at the
time.
<P>
The grasslands supplied an excellent source of food for the animals
and provided most of the essentials for the families of the settlers,
but most of the original grasslands were destroyed because of the lack
of understanding of the interrelationship of the ecoenvironmental
systems and habitat.  Because the prairie dogs, kangaroo rats, and the
jackrabbits constituted a problem and were considered as competitors
with the settlers' livestock, and could create serious injuries to the
cattle, horses and the riders when in the fields, they set out to
eradicate them.  At the same time, faced with what they considered a
menace to their livelihood, the settlers waged an all out warfare to
exterminate the coyotes, badgers, hawks, owls, snakes and other
predatory animals which had held the prairie dogs and the other rodents
in check.  As a result, the prairie dogs became more abundant and began
to overrun other areas previously unoccupied.  It got to the point that
the cost of getting rid of the prairie dogs and the antelope jackrabbits
cost more than the cattlemen were getting from the sale of their cattle.
It wasn't all that long before overgrazing the grasslands brought about
permanent damage and increasing wasteland to many regions of the
country.
<P>
By 1850, the nation's manifest destiny had been accomplished with the
expansion of the country's boundaries from the Atlantic to the Pacific
oceans.  Cartographers, seeking to fill in the gaps of geographic
knowledge, were able in their survey to replace the innocuous term
``unexplored'' given to the West with the phrase, ``the Great American
Desert.''
<P>
It was not until John Wesley Powell, Director of the U.S. Geological
Survey (1881-1894), and author of the classic report, <cite>Lands of the Arid
Region</cite>, published in 1879, defined the limits of the arid regions of
the West and presented for the first time a meaningful and coherent
program for its proper utilization. Powell estimated that much of the
land in the country fell into the arid and semi-arid category, and that
most of these areas received only meager periods of normal rainfall. 
And that drawing upon the limited underground water table in these areas
would result in years of drought and permanent damage to the land and
environment and eventual impoverishment.  That in time these arid and
semi-arid lands would become more acute and complex and should not be
plowed or used for grazing.  But, as usual, Powell's recommendations
fell on deaf ears and were ignored.
<P>
The livestock industry and other vested interests, who had acquired
rights to most of the public land in the semi-arid and arid regions, and
had considerable clout in the political circles of governments, were too
much of a formidable force to be denied in their quest to use these
barren lands.  How the land and the natural resources of the country are
to be used, and for what purpose, has never been given any serious
consideration by those interests that are concerned only with immediate
gain and maximizing profits, even if it means their and civilization's
eventual demise.
<P>
<H3>CONSERVATION PROPOSAL SCUTTLED AGAIN</H3>
<P>
In spite of some of his inconsistencies concerning conservation, it
was not until Theodore Roosevelt entered upon his presidency that the
nation became more aroused to the importance of the conservation of
America's natural resources, the needless waste and the need for
responsibility in the use of the country's resources.  It was Roosevelt
who inaugurated a White House Conference, and the appointment of a
National Conservation Commission to make a study and survey of what
could be done to prevent unrestrained destruction and needless waste
that was taking place to, and in the use of, the country's natural
resources.
<P>
The National Conservation Commission was given the authority to make
an inventory of the country's existing available natural resources.  It
was also directed to make a report as to the amount of the natural
resources that had already been used or exhausted; and to make a report
of the rate in the consumption of the nation's natural resources, and
the probable period of time it would take for the country's resources to
last and still meet the requirements of the social, infrastructural, and
industrial mechanism.
<P>
From the National Conservation Commission and the concern of
scientists and citizens came a breakthrough in establishing those
agencies and departments in government to regulate, to protect and
preserve the natural resources of the country.  Through the U.S.
Department of Interior some 234 million acres of land were withdrawn
from private entry.  Large areas of public land were held in reserve
until their use could be determined by a thorough study.  These lands
included where coal was known to be beneath the surface; where natural
gas and oil were likely to be present; where phosphate rock was expected
to exist; where important reserves of potash deposits were present; and
where minerals were likely to be present.  At least some progress was
being accomplished to preserve the natural resources of the country, but
it should be noted that 270 years had passed since the landing of the
Pilgrims before the first national forest was established.
<P>
It should be brought out that the already mentioned Charles Richard
Hise, who became President of the University of Wisconsin and was a
long-term member of the U.S. Geological Survey, was appointed to serve
on the National Conservation Commission.  During his lustrous career
Hise prepared and presented a series of lectures concerning the
importance of the conservation of natural resources before the students
and faculty of the University of Wisconsin.  For 25 years his volume,
<cite>The Conservation of Natural Resources in the United
States</cite> served as
one of the most instructive and instrumental books on the subject that
was responsible for developing a greater appreciation and awareness of
the importance of preserving, protecting and the wise use of the natural
resources of the country.
<P>
As for the proposal of conducting a survey and inventory of the
damage and destruction that had been done to the resource base of the
country during the westward settlement and development, and the adoption
of a compatible and sustainable program to prevent further devastation
to the natural resources and habitat of the country, nothing of a real
and long-term consequence came of it.
<P>
As a matter of fact, rather than approving and allowing the National
Conservation Commission to continue with its study, the Congress of the
United States would not provide the funds for the NCC to undertake and
carry out its intended purpose or mission.  To scuttle the work and the
recommendations of the Commission, the Congress even prohibited the
agencies and departments of the federal government from providing their
services or helping the National Conservation Commission in any research
and studies concerning its recommendations.  As before, once again the
pressure applied and the financial inducements by the special interests
of the business establishment prevailed in the democratic political
arena and under the present entrenched economic system.
<P>
<h3>THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION AND THE IMPACT ON THE RESOURCE BASE</h3>
<P>
As late as 1880, two-thirds of the population in the United States
lived on the farm, and agriculture was the predominant livelihood of
most Americans.  (Farmers make up only 2 percent of the nation's
population today.)  Minerals, except gold and silver, did not create
much interest until after 1850.  But from the industrial revolution came
greater diversity in agriculture, mining for minerals and energy
resources, methods of processing, manufacturing of goods and services,
transportation, etc.  From the development of industry, the growth of
the cities, and the increasing population came the demand and need for
greater quantities of natural resources to meet the requirements of the
social, industrial and infrastructural complex.
<P>
Meeting the growth and development that has taken place before and
during the industrial and agricultural revolution in the United States
and other parts of the world has put a tremendous impact on the natural
resource reserves of this finite Earth.  Even with warnings, research
and studies over the years that pinpoint the devastation and wasteful
consumption of the world's resources, the exploitation and ravaging of
the earth's remaining resources continue unabated.
<P>
Being the largest of nations in the consumption of natural resources,
and since becoming a nation, the United States continues to exploit and
use its remaining dwindling natural resources as if there are no limits
to its and the world's resources. Although the United States has been
endowed with a greater diversity of land and soils than any other
nation, it continues to exploit them and use methods and practices that
are detrimental to the practical importance in soil fertility and
long-term sustainability.  The country and the American people have yet
to come to grips with the understanding that the soil of a nation is its
most valuable material heritage, and our existence depends on how we
treat and take care of it.
<P>
While modern technology, new scientific innovations and techniques,
along with an increasing use of fertilizers and chemicals, have
increased the yields in agricultural production, it has also increased
the cost, financial and energy wise, in the growing of crops and in the
operation of farming where it may not be feasible in the future.  While
there has been an increase in the production and the yields per acre in
the farming of the land in the United States, and these yields of food
and other items have provided most of the needs and requirements of
most, if not all, of the American people, there are any number of
factors that are negating the feasibility and any long-term
sustainability from these innovations.
<P>
For instance, as Albert Allen Bartlett has said, ``The basis for our
technology is largely petroleum.''  In his research and observation, he
concluded that ``modern agriculture is using land (for the purpose) to
convert petroleum to food.''  As an example, it takes 140 gallons of fuel
to produce an acre of corn.  Some time ago Rosalind Creasy reported that
the United States uses 20 BTU's of fuel energy to produce 1 BTU of food
energy.  While the use (or misuse) of technology, fertilizers,
pesticides, petroleum and other chemicals have increased the yields per
acre of growing crops many fold, they also have created an unfavorable
impact on a depleting resource base: the soil, the environment and water
resources.  While the ever increasing use of petroleum and chemicals has
created a bonanza for those industries, it is a trend that has ominous
long-term ramifications for the present market oriented economy and the
resource base of the United States and the rest of the world.
<P>
By not adopting a comprehensive natural resource program or plan, the
United States, operating under the present economic system with its
inherent characteristic of exploitation and based on growth, expansion
and investment to maximize profits, has shown a disregard for its most
important asset, which is responsible for its very existence.
<P>
<H3>IS THE UNITED STATES AND THE WORLD FACING A FOOD SCARCITY?</H3>
<P>
At one time the farms of the United States produced a surplus of food
and various raw materials.  And in some categories of producing crops,
surpluses are still common.  And even crops and cattle have been
deliberately destroyed or made unfit for consumption for the purpose of
maintaining an artificial scarcity and bringing higher prices.  Without
a balance between production and distribution, concern with prices
and profits, the farm and food industries have over the years gone
through crisis after crisis.  All kinds of financial and political
incentives, palliatives, and expediencies have been tried to bring some
kind of order into the production and distribution of farm products but
without any stable or viable solutions or success.  Diverted merely to
the price and market oriented structure of the present economic system
of profitability, and not protecting and preserving the most productive
land of the country, the United States is faced with its most serious
problems in history.
<P>
There was a time when American agriculture was hailed as having the
most productive capacity in the world.  But it now has reached its
limits and is losing its most productive prime land.  The biggest thief
is growth and expansion from urban sprawl and its ever increasing
population.  Today there are highways, shopping centers, houses,
buildings of all kinds and airports on land that once produced an
abundance of grain and timber, forage, vegetables and fruits.  There are
now motels and reservoirs, industrial parks on land where farmers once
grazed their cattle and harvested cotton and other raw materials.
<P>
America has already lost over half of its top soil.  And according to
the American Farmland Trust, it continues to lose 2 million acres of its
farmland to development every year.  In addition, the United States
loses 3 billion tons of prime and irreplaceable top soil through wind
and water erosion.  Alternating between years of drought and floods, and
with the incessant soil erosion, America's agriculture and farms are
faced with an uncertain future that will affect this country and the
world.  In a matter of less than two decades the United States has
doubled the loss of the world's best agricultural land to development
and urban sprawl.
<P>
Over the years there have been any number of warnings given by
specialists in the field of land management, conservation and
environmental affairs, and various research organizations about the
rapid disappearance of land, the natural resources and habitat in the
United States and throughout the world.  But even with these warnings
from soil conservationists and scientists, economists, sociologists,
land-use planners, forest and range conservationists, fish and wildlife
specialists, and concerned citizens, nothing has stopped the onslaught
of wanton squandering of an irreplaceable resource that has already
caused tragedy on a national and global scale.
<P>
The pamphlet, <cite>Where Have The Farm Lands Gone?</cite>, published by the
National Agricultural Lands Study in 1979, portrays a dismal picture
even then of what was happening to the land area in the United States. 
It brings out the fact that in the war between the plow and the
bulldozer, one million acres of America's prime farm land was being
urbanized every year.  In addition to prime land loss, the nation was
losing two million acres of lesser quality land to nonagricultural
conversion each year.  The study reports that this would mean the total
annual loss of three million acres would be the equivalent of 320 acres,
or a half section of farm land every hour.  In spite of the programs and
plans that have been initiated, which include Federal, state and local
governments, landowners and public interest groups for the purpose of
preventing the loss and retention of cropland, this massive degradation
of the soil continues at a much greater rate than ever before.  By and
large, America's private property rights have been constrained very
little by the government of the United States.
<P>
In the same pamphlet, <cite>Where Have The Farm Lands Gone?</cite>,
a reference is
made to a series of front-page articles titled, ``Vanishing Acres'' that
appeared July 8 through 13, 1979 in the <cite>Des Moines Register</cite> by
Washington Correspondent George Anthan.  His findings and conclusions
concerning the farm land in the United States and its impact are as
follows:
<blockquote>
<P>
``Every time a baby is born in the United States, agriculture loses
one and one-third acres of cropland.  The connection isn't direct - it's
a mathematical comparison of population and land-loss trends - but
dramatizes a problem:  Our population is growing, our available farm
land is shrinking, and our per acre crop yields are leveling off.
<P>
``All food produced in the United States will be consumed here.
<P>
``Consumer food prices will be pushed sharply upward.  This will be a
'real' price increase, not just an 'inflation' increase.
<P>
``Food exports no longer will be available to help offset massive
trade deficits, such as payments for foreign oil.  This almost certainly
would have a major negative effect on the national economy.
<P>
``The hungry people of other nations will be on their own for food
supplies.''
</blockquote>
<P>
The above were some of Anthan's projections and predictions for the
year 2000 if farm losses and the population of the United States and the
world continue to increase.
<P>
<H3>EARTH'S ILLS WORSEN</H3>
<P>
For many years <a href="http://www.worldwatch.org/">Worldwatch Institute</a>
has been at the forefront
carrying on research and publishing many books and papers on the future
of agriculture, the environment, natural resources and population
trends.  It has pointed out the continued loss of cropland and the
voracious consumption and waste of the natural resource base, and the
growing demographic problems that confront the world.
<P>
A recent release by the Associated Press of
<a href="http://www.worldwatch.org/">Worldwatch Institute's</a>
annual report, <cite>State of the World</cite>, paints another bleak global
landscape.  Unfortunately, few governments are doing anything to reverse
the decline.  In the same release by AP, Earth Summit Secretary-General
Maurice Strong issued a report that ``far too few countries, companies,
institutions, communities and citizens have made the choices and changes
needed to advance the goals of sustainable development.''  More than 100
nations are worse off today than 15 years ago, with 1.3-billion people
earning less than $1 a day.
<P>
The AP release also mentions that Eileen Claussen, Assistant
Secretary of State overseeing environmental affairs, said Worldwatch's
assessment of progress is ``generally correct.''  She noted Congress
failed to ratify a biodiversity treaty and slashed funding for the
summit's major initiatives.  Those in the Administration and Congress
are well aware of the fact that they must get most of their funds for
any election campaign from those companies and corporations that don't
want any environmental and other restrictions or regulations on their
operations.  The latter's concern is only with the bottom line and the
present, regardless of what happens to the environment and the resource
base of this finite Earth.
<P>
The importance of preserving and protecting what is left of this
country's farm land cannot be ignored or taken for granted.  ``The wheat
fields of Kansas and the corn fields of Iowa may look boundless but they
are not.  As a nation we must come to full realization that prime farm
land is no longer a surplus resource, if indeed, it ever was.''  Stated
by Robert Gray, who was the Executive Director of the National
Agricultural Lands Study (1980-81).  Once prime land is lost, there is
no way that a consumer can go to the supermarket and buy one square foot
of it.
<P>
<H3>THE MAGNITUDE OF DEFORESTATION CONTINUES</H3>
<P>
At one time forest and trees covered 26 percent of the land, but just
12 percent of the earth's surface consists of intact forest ecosystems
now.  The original forests of the United States covered about 43 percent
of the land area of the country.  By 1900, 50 percent of the forest of
the United States were cut down and harvested to make room for expansion
and development.  By 1980, approximately 24 percent of the eastern
forest had been cleared for farms.
<P>
Nearly 400 years ago, the virgin land of America was blanketed with
850 million acres of primeval forest.  Excluding those protected parts
of the national parks and wilderness areas, the last remnants of the
untouched woods of the country amount to about only one-million
scattered acres.  About 2.8 billion trees are cut down each year, and
the United States is one of the most prolific in the world when it comes
to logging and wasting its already depleted forests, even more than
twice as much as Brazil.
<P>
The forests are disappearing at a much faster rate than ever before
in the history of the world.  Between 1971 and 1986, forests shrank by
at least 125 million hectares.  In 1991, the world economy consumed 3.4
billion cubic meters of wood, 2.5 times as much wood as was used in 1950
- one third more per person.  When agricultural and nonagricultural
needs and consumption are taken into account, it is estimated that human
population growth may be responsible for as much as 80 percent of the
loss of forest cover worldwide.  Half of the world depends on fuelwood
for heating and cooking.  And since 1990, 100 million Third World
residents have lacked sufficient firewood to meet their daily energy
requirements.  The other half of the world's wood is cut as timber,
milled and processed into boards, plywood, veneer, chipboard, paper,
paperboard and other products, mostly in industrial countries.
<P>
According to the latest figures available from the U.N. Food and
Agriculture Organization, Japan is one of the largest consumers of
hardwood and processed lumber.  Although the country's 120 million
people represent only 2.7 percent of the world's population, Japan
consumes a third of the wood exported worldwide and 70 percent of that
exported by other Asian nations, according to the FAO.  About 45 percent
of that imported wood comes from Southeast Asia, 34 percent from the
United States, and 14 percent from the former Soviet Union.  John
Holliman, a spokesperson for the Japanese office of the conservation
organization, Friends of Earth, states that only 5 percent of Japan's
timber comes from sustainable sources.  The rest is being ``mined'' and
will take decades, even centuries to recover.
<P>
Holliman reports that at least 741 million acres of Southeast Asia's
forests have already been destroyed, and 74 to 173 million more acres
will be doomed by the turn of the century.  Many of the trees are
bulldozed, cut down and abandoned just so the loggers can reach the most
valuable or more profitable trees.  In the process, large logging and
lumber corporations destroy up to 60 percent of the rest of the forest. 
As a result, this method of operation damages the ability of the 
rain forest to produce oxygen. It destroys the wildlife habitat and 
triggers a chain reaction, causing greater soil erosion, landslides, 
silt buildup and flooding as the soil flows to the sea where it 
suffocates coral reefs, a source of marine and ocean life.  What is 
happening to the rain forests of Southeast Asia is occurring to the rain 
forests throughout the world.
<P>
America's record during its history as to deforestation is no better
than what has happened to the forests in many parts of the world.  The
magnitude with which the United States haphazardly cut down and
destroyed the forests and the trees of the country is one of the most
flagrant travesties in its history.  Although it was assumed during the
great westward movement that the land and the natural resources were
bountiful and without limitations, the indiscriminate cutting down of
the forests and removing the trees for farming and development went on
without giving much consideration to future consequences.  As a result,
most of the original North American old growth forests were virtually
leveled.  Huge loads of these magnificent trees were cut and hauled from
logging camps and sent to the sawmills to be used in the expansion and
building of the country.  During the expansion of railroads in many
parts of the country, railroad ties were made of walnut, considered
along with cherry wood as one of the rarest and most valuable of all
North American hardwoods.
<P>
In an article by William Souder, special reporter to <cite>The Washington
Post</cite>, he reports that the logging companies just about denuded the trees
across Wisconsin, Michigan and Minnesota. The lumber and logging
companies cut down the trees on the shorelands, on the ridges and the
highlands.  After the trees became scarce in those areas, the logging
companies moved inland until the forests were no longer feasible.  Once
plentiful, the oaks, richly figured maples, hemlocks, basswoods, yellow
birches and rare elms were harvested and hauled to the lumber mills. 
Some of these old growth trees were seedlings when Columbus landed in
the Americas.
<P>
At the turn of the century (1890s), and in the heyday of the lumber
mills and the logging camps, Ashland, Wisconsin was among the busiest
ports on the Great Lakes at the peak of the lumber business.  It had 15
sawmills at the height of logging in the region. In the winter of
1892-93, there were 10,000 men logging trees in the area.  Scott
Mitchen, who is retrieving those hardwood and other trees that sunk in
Lake Superior during the logging and sawmill operation in the upper
Midwest States, has concluded from his observation and experience in his
treasure hunt that ``they surely thought they'd never run out of trees.'' 
Under the most favorable conditions, it takes 80 to 100 years to grow a
hardwood tree.
<P>
Given the circumstances, Mitchen's operation of recycling these rare
hardwood trees is considered environmentally friendly.  There is no
current supply of wood of this quality.  The trees are gone forever.
<P>
Those rare hardwood trees that are recovered in this undertaking are
going to be sold at a very high price to the elite of the Japanese and
America's entrenched rich, and maybe to the new robber barons of the
twentieth and soon to be the twenty-first century. It could indicate
that Thorstein Veblen's characteristic behavior of the leisure class with
their conspicuous consumption and ostentatious lifestyle is still with
us and very much alive.  It's as if the natural resources of this
continental area have no limits and must, by all means, accommodate the
extravagant and wasteful tastes of the rich and super-rich regardless of
the consequences.  (The richest 20 percent of the world now earn 85
percent of the income or money, compared with 70 percent three decades
ago.)
<P>
As for preserving and preventing the wholesale and haphazard methods
of cutting down those forests that are still standing, the plundering of
the forests of the United States and the world goes on as before.  Most
of the forests in the United States and throughout the world are in
danger.  As a representative case in point, over half of the prime
timber of the Tongass National Forest, which is strung across 500 miles
of southeast Alaska, has already been felled.  The clash between the
environmentalists and the lumber industry over these ancient forests has
now reached a feverish pitch.  The environmentalists and concerned
Americans have for a long time opposed many of the U.S. Forest Service's
policies of selling the national forest trees at a ridiculous low price
to those contractors and companies in the lumber business, using their
financial resources to provide roads and other concessions to the large
lumber companies.  Adding insult to injury, the Congress of the United
States gives millions of dollars in subsidies to the timber and lumber
corporations.
<P>
The Ketchikan Pulp Company, which logs and depends on the Tongass
National Forest, America's largest remaining forest, signed in 1954 a
50-year contract to harvest the trees in the Tongass for a fraction of
their market value.  Because of its lengthy pollution record for being
the largest discharger of toxic waste, the Environmental Protection
Agency gave Ketchikan Pulp a slight tap on the wrist, levied them with
fines and civil penalties amounting to about $6 million. 
Louisiana-Pacific Corporation, the $2.8 billion international
conglomerate that owns Ketchikan Pulp, is now willing to spend $200
million on antipollution equipment and technology to clean up its act
providing Congress will give L-PC a 15-year extension on its 50-year
contract and increase the allowable timber harvest in the Tongass and
restore other concessions.  (Probably over a period of time subsidies
given by Congress at the taxpayers' expense will pay for this
proposition at no cost to Louisiana-Pacific Corporation.)  Like most
companies, except when downsizing, Ketchikan and L-PC have used the
leverage that without extending its contract, it will mean the
elimination of Alaska's 17th largest private employer, throw out of work
1,000 workers and turn Ketchikan, a town of 15,000, into a ghost town. 
It would take a huge chunk out of Ketchikan's timber, fishing and
tourism economy.  Surely there are many important things the American
people could be doing that would be beneficial to the nation and all of
the American people, and still maintain the forest's biological and
environmental diversity. Must maintaining and perpetuating the
destructive and wasteful practices of this economic system take
precedence over everything else?
<P>
What has become one of the most disturbing factors in the protection
and preservation of America's natural heritage has been the role taken
by the U.S. Government and its various departments and administrative
offices.  This political form of government has been too prone and
lenient to those vested and special interests whose main concern is
maximizing profitability regardless of what happens to the country's
natural resources in the process.  Being on a collision course with the
forces of nature, the nation has become shackled with an economic system
that insidiously devours the very fabric and natural resource base that
is essential to maintaining a viable and sustaining method of operation
for the survival of all forms of life.
<P>
While the Administration and Congress continue with their never
ending debates and hearings over balancing the national budget
(projected to be $6 trillion by 2000), the American people are being
fleeced and denied the benefits of the country's natural heritage. 
Balancing the natural resource base with what is essential to our very
existence is far removed from the thoughts and agenda of the
politicians.  They are more concerned with giving away the store at the
expense of the American people.  As a case in point, Congress passed a
law way back in 1872 that gave cart blanche to the miners and the mining
companies.  Not all that surprising, considering what takes place in
political and business circles, the Mining Act of 1872 is still on the
books, and the Congress refuses to repeal that law to meet modern needs
and requirements.
<P>
If there was ever an anachronism, the Mining Act of 1872 would be at
the top of the list.  The fee for registering a mine claim is only $2.50
to $5 an acre, plus an annual fee of $100.  Even if all mining stops or
never takes place, the miner or the mining company continues to own the
land.  And there are no royalty fees whatsoever paid on the profits that
come from mining these public lands by the owners.  According to The
Wilderness Society's Resource Planning and Economics Department, between
1873 and 1998 $363 billion worth of gold, silver and copper were mined
from public lands.  If the miners and the mining companies had paid a
12.5 percent royalty that other companies pay for extracting nonmetals
from public land, such as oil, just these three metals alone would have
added $40 billion to the treasury of the United States.  (What a bargain
for the miners and the mining industries.)  Balancing the national
budget seems to have a hollow ring in the halls of Congress.
<P>
The extraction, refining, dispersing, and the disposal of metals and
their byproducts have created immense damage to the environmental and
ecological systems.  Mining has degraded the land, created quarries and
vast open pits and enormous amounts of solid waste.  During 1991 more
than 1,000 million metric tons of copper ore were dug up just to obtain
9 million metric tons of metal.  Besides contaminating the air, water
and soil during the mining and refining process, fine particles of trace
metals are dispersed that accumulate in the soil and the aquatic
ecosystems, and in the animal and human food chain.  Leaching from
tailings from mining and the disposal of chemicals used in refining are
significant sources of water pollution.
<P>
In the state of Florida, the fertilizer industry owns 515,000 acres
of land that produces plant and animal supplements from phosphates it
digs from the ground.  From an aerial view of the strip mining that goes
on in Polk County for phosphate, one can see ``the whitish dimples,
shaped like lakes'' showing on the ground where the fertilizing industry
has created 700 million stacks of solid waste in huge piles.  So far,
mining for phosphates in the area has claimed 400 square miles of land,
and less than half has been reclaimed or restored.
<P>
There are those environmental organizations and concerned citizens
that have denounced the operations by Mulberry Phosphates and its
indifference toward the impact on the environment and the health of the
people in the area.  From the figures that have been given to the
Environmental Protection Agency by manufacturers as part of the Toxic
Release Inventory program, the Environmental Working Group issued a
report from these figures accusing Mulberry Phosphates of dumping large
amounts of ammonia into the North Prong of the Alafia River, and that
phosphogypsum with radium 226 gives rise to radon gas that causes
harmful health problems.  But Mulberry Phosphates has challenged the
report by EWG, and as the issue continues mammoth piles of solid waste
inundate the landscape.  While a small fine and a desist order might
come out of this matter, usually the financial position of the
corporation and its political clout along with the bottom line
determines the outcome regardless of the damage to the environment and
the health of the people.
<P>
Now that the exploitation of metals, mineral fuels and nonmetals that
went on for decades is no longer fashionable, many countries throughout
the world have used a more effective approach when it comes to their
mineral and nonmetals - they have gotten rid of foreign imperialism by
nationalizing their natural resources.  As to whether all of the people
of these countries have benefited from the process is another matter and
may account for a considerable amount of violence and ``terrorism'' that
goes on in the world today.
<P>
<h3>AMERICA'S RESOURCE DEFICIENCIES AND THE ``SUPERPOWER'' FANTASY</h3>
<P>
Besides the past plundering of America's natural resources, its
production of waste and obsolescence, and goods and services of dubious
use and function, nothing has had a greater drain on the resource base
of the country than the perpetuation of war and the huge defense
expenditures that go toward the preparation for future wars under the
guise of national security.
<P>
While the United States and the rest of the world have gone through
the most destructive and devastating war in all history during World War
II, the industrial, financial and vested interests in the United States,
along with the cooperation of the political officialdom, decided that
massive and unending defense expenditures would provide the best safety
net for the status quo and business-as-usual rather than mobilizing the
nation's resources for reconstruction and meaningful pursuits.  With the
support of the industrial establishment, Charles Wilson, president of
General Electric and major defense contractor, set the tone and the
course that the United States would take following World War II.  Wilson
called for the United States ``to begin now to set in motion the
machinery for a permanent war economy.''
<P>
For over five decades the United States has become addicted and
dependent on the business of war and the production and sale of arms. 
During the Cold War, the United States has spent $11-$12 trillion
dollars on military weapons, equipment, supplies and bases worldwide
since World War II.  If the expenditures of those departments and
agencies that are directly or indirectly involved in military affairs or
activities were counted, the figure of $11-$12 trillion would be
substantially higher.  The United States spent a minimum of $4 trillion
on nuclear weapons and their deadly legacy since 1940.  The Department
of Energy has become merely an adjunct of the Department of Defense.  It
is also the cost of maintaining the deployment of troops and bases all
around the globe, protecting and providing arms, materiel and training
for other countries, even for those nations that are financially and
industrially developed in their own right and can afford to pay for
their own defense, that is breaking the financial and resource bank.
<P>
From his research and studies, Seymour Melman of Columbia University
was able to conclude that the amount of the military expenditures by the
United States since World War II, and during the Cold War, would have
been equivalent to the cost of replacing the entire infrastructure of
the country:  the basic foundation that is necessary to operate an
effective functional social and industrial order - the nation's roads,
power plants and waterworks, schools, housing, transportation and
communication systems.  It would include those installations and
facilities that have been sorely neglected and allowed to deteriorate
while the government and the leadership of the nation and the
nomenclatura of the Soviet Union fiddled in the ideological and
parasitic folly of the Cold War.
<P>
From the conventional and nuclear arms race came a permanent war
economy, gaining momentum until it reached the point of overkill.  By
continuing the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union
proceeded to produce some 50,000 missiles, warheads and nuclear weapons
with the explosive power of 18,000 megatons, or the equivalent to 6,000
World War II's.  While this was going on, some experts in the Department
of Defense pointed out that once the United States reached the 400 level
of nuclear warheads, the construction or production of any additional
nuclear weapons would be a waste of money and resources.  Needless to
say, this lucid deduction and mathematical computation was not
appreciated by those beneficiaries of the mega military expenditures and
the continued growth and expansion of the military-industrial contract
complex.  Rather than deterrents, the ``defense'' program of the United
States has become a trillion dollar business where enormous profits have
been made.
<P>
<!--XXX-->
A Worldwatch Paper by Michael Renner with the title of <cite>Budgeting For
Disarmament:  the Costs of War and Peace</cite> goes into considerable detail
concerning the costs imposed by warfare and its multitudinous effects on
the nations throughout the world.  Renner brings out the fact that
global military spending since World War II has added up to a cumulative
and astronomical sum of $30-$35 trillion.  As a result, military and
defense expenditures that took place during the Cold War and numerous
conflicts, absorbed and brought about the dissipation of substantial
amounts of essential resources that could have been used for human
security and economic equality, health, education, housing, poverty
eradication and greater environmental sustainment.
<P>
If the United States, the former Soviet Union and other countries of
the world had mobilized their natural and human resources, the expertise
of their scientists and engineers all the time of the cold or
ideological war for meaningful and peaceful pursuits for rebuilding and
redesigning their social and technological structures into a more
efficient operation, then the Americans, Russians and the peoples of the
world would by now be enjoying an era of greater economic prosperity and
peace.  It is ironic that the United States and its leadership continue
to spend trillions of dollars and waste its and the world's natural
resources on the implements of war and destruction but will not spend or
use its resources to put its own house in order when its survival is at
stake.  This would be the best idea that America could export as an
example to the nations of the world.
<P>
While there was a time when the United States had a lion's share of
the known natural resources in the world, it now finds itself far from
being sufficient in a number of resource categories to meet its present
technological and industrial society's needs.  With about 6 percent of
the world's population, the United States consumes 30 percent of the
world's resources.  From waste and the production of obsolescence, wars
and their destruction, the abuse and misuse of its technology, neglect
and deterioration, the United States lacks the necessary resources to
operate and maintain its some thirty-five billion horsepower of prime
movers.
<P>
As a matter of fact, in the lst 50 years the per capita consumption
of minerals in the United States has multiplied 15 times.  The United
States has consumed more minerals from 1940 to 1976 than did all
humanity up to 1940.  In 1940, the population of the United States was
131.6 million people; now it is over 264 million, and the Census Bureau
projects that there will be 20 million more people living in America by
the end of this century.  The implications and ramifications of this
trend overshadows the constant gobbledygook that comes out of
Washington.
<P>
The United States is deficient and depends on foreign countries for
most of its essential mineral resources that are necessary to maintain
and operate its technological-industrial and infrastructural complex. 
For most of its mineral resources, this country depends on foreign
sources for its supply of chromium, cobalt, manganese, columbium, tin,
antimony, nickel, platinum-group metals, iron ore, vanadium, etc.  All
of these metals are necessary and essential in the production of about
everything in the United States: chemical and metallurgical industries,
additives in steel making and superalloys, automotive, electric and
electronics, jet engines, airframes, space and missile applications,
stainless steel industry, etc.,etc.
<P>
The best or choicest areas of mineral resources are being mined, and
the world's mineral reserve base has been on the decline for some time.
Unless there are major discoveries in the future, nations will find the
availability of minerals the most fundamental detriment to economic
growth in the industrial output.  As the mineral producing nations use
more of their minerals for their own development, the competition among
countries for minerals will become greater and take on a new dimension.
And as the mineral producing nations acquire and develop markets in
other countries, it is not likely they will cut off those supplies to
those nations just to meet an emergency that could happen in the United
States and in some of the industrial countries.  Stability in many of
the mineral producing nations has always been rather precarious.
<P>
Military requirements for metallic and non metallic minerals are such
that the wartime consumption exceeds peacetime consumption.  But with
the United States being the largest producer and seller of arms in the
world, the competition for minerals is not just between countries, but
within the United States as to which is most important and has the
highest priority when it comes to the acquisition and use of essential
and critical minerals.  Considering that the United States depends on
foreign countries for most of its essential resources, and consumes
minerals and energy on a massive scale while the resource base of the
producing countries is being depleted at a rapid rate, the United
States will find it difficult to maintain and operate its technological
and industrial mechanism even without the ongoing burden of the
parasitic and non-productive military-industrial establishment.
<P>
The U.S. economy consumes an enormous quantity of materials.  In
1989, a total of 4.5 billion metric tons of natural resources were
consumed in the United States - about 18 metric tons per person. 
Consumption of industrial minerals alone amounted to 317 million metric
tons.  During the past decade, this country has used more plastic on a
volume basis than all metals combined, resulting in a growing volume of
consumer and solid waste.  Compared with other countries, the United
States appears to be the largest waste generator in most categories. 
The amount of waste generated throughout the world, including industrial
or hazardous waste, has had a deleterious effect on the environment and
the health of nations.
<P>
Besides being dependent on most of its consumption of minerals, the
United States has become more dependent on petroleum to operate its
industrial and infrastructural complex.  To put it in numerical terms,
before 1979 the United States was importing about 45 percent of its oil.
After 1979, as conservation kicked in as a result of the ``oil shocks'',
oil imports were reduced to 32 percent by 1985.  All the rhetorical
bombast to establish a comprehensive conservation program to make the
United States independent of foreign oil went by way of all previous
political pronouncements and edicts.  The petroleum industry in the U.S.
was against curtailing its production of oil.  Since 1985, imports of
oil have been increasing, topping 50 percent last year.
<P>
The United States continues to be the largest consumer of energy in
the world, about 5.4 times the global average.  And liquid fuels,
primarily derived from petroleum, still are dominant in the world's
energy consumption.  The U.S. is the largest debtor nation in the world,
and its consumption from the importation of oil is one of the main
reasons why it has the largest trade deficit in the world. The
federal government took measures and spent millions of dollars in an
effort to meet the oil crisis, but as soon as the ``oil shocks'' of
1973-75 and 1979-81 were over, and the price of oil decreased per barrel
on the international market, it was back to business as usual.
<P>
While the Department of Energy could have made a major contribution
toward the conservation and the increased efficiency in the use of
energy, it spent a large part of its $4 trillion appropriations during
the Cold War maintaining and building nuclear plants and nuclear bombs
for the military instead of developing renewable resources, conservation
of energy resources, and more efficient methods to curtail waste.  To
clean up the mess that DOE has made will amount to billions of dollars
and the waste of more natural resources.
<P>
With speed limits increasing and the gas guzzlers back, it is
estimated that American drivers will be using 14 percent more gasoline.
As a result, the U.S. will have to import more oil.  There has been
little overall fuel efficiency during last year or the year before. 
``Fuel efficiency has become stagnate,'' according to John DeCicco of the
American Council for Emergency Efficiency Economy, a research and
lobbying firm promoting energy conservation.  If there are any areas
left in the world where the exploration and development for oil might be
feasible, for what purpose would it be to strike oil if the United
States continues to operate and maintain the most inefficient and
wasteful system in the world?
<P>
There is no better example than the replacement of the street car by
the ruthless and underhanded methods used by the automotive,
transportation, oil, tire and highway-building industries and
manufacturers.  These industries and companies along with financial and
other vested interests undertook a brazen and systematic scheme to
eliminate and destroy the trolley companies.  They bought out the
legislators and the city dads; set up shills or front companies called
the National City Lines for the purpose of buying out and replacing the
trolley companies throughout the United States.  Once these
entrepreneurial vultures got the upper hand and control of the trolley
companies, they made certain that the street cars and light trains could
not be introduced by removing the tracks and paving over the streets
where the street cars ran.  The street cars were stacked like worthless
junk and burned to make sure they could not ever be used again.  The
street cars that provided low fares and efficient service for millions
of people were soon replaced by automobiles and buses that clogged the
streets, spewing out blankets of noxious fumes and smog.  Considering
how the economic system works, the millions of unhappy commuters that
used the street cars had very little input in the process.  It was all
done in the name of ``progress'', the creation of jobs, and, of course,
profits.  But ``justice'' was served when the industries and the companies
that conspired in the overthrow of the street car companies were found
guilty in the court of law.  They paid their fines of $5,000, and then
proceeded to sell their wares where most of these corporations became
the largest and most profitable industries in the United States and the
world.
<P>
But the street cars were not the only casualty in this great
conspiracy to bamboozle the American people and take them for a ride. 
Next came the highpower sell and spin that the United States needed a
super interstate highway to accommodate the mass production of
automobiles coming off the assembly lines, to provide the transportation
that would come from urban development, and, by all means, national
security just in case the United States got into another major war.  It
didn't take very long for the special interests and the pork brokers to
strike a deal to make sure that the interstate road system would be
built at the expense of the American people.
<P>
In the 1950s, General Motors President, Charles Wilson, became
Secretary of Defense, and Francis DuPont of munitions fame, whose
family was the largest stockholder in GM for obvious reasons, brokered
and sold the idea that to meet modern times and the future development
of the country it would be necessary to build superhighways all across
the United States from the east to the west coast, and from the southern
border to the Canadian border.  The politicos in the highest positions
of government supported and concurred with the decision to build an
interstate highway system throughout the nation.  Very little thought
was given to the idea of what the future consequences would be from
gearing and designing America's infrastructure to the automobile and the
need for ever increasing consumption of oil, the impact upon the
lifestyle of the people, and the effect on the environment and the
resource base of the country and the world.  What is good for General
Motors is not good by any means for the country.
<P>
For years the United States has neglected and allowed its
infrastructure to deteriorate.  Keeping its 45,000 miles of highways,
bridges, roads and streets in a functional condition to accommodate the
millions of vehicles that use these facilities has and will continue to
be a monumental undertaking for years to come.  There are already 50
percent of the bridges in the country that need to be repaired or
replaced.  Building and extending the present hodge-podge highway system
just to meet the millions of cars that are added each year to the
highways and streets of the nation that have already reached a point of
no return has created many serious problems.
<P>
The lack of any overall efficient and functional plan in the growth
and expansion of the urban-suburban areas, and the dependence and
reliance mostly on automobiles as a major means of transportation, and
the extension of the meandering systems of highways and freeways in an
attempt to meet the traffic gridlock has become an impossible mission,
too expensive to maintain and operate, financially or resource wise. 
America is now stuck with the largest maze of hodge-podge in the world,
covering much of the prime land of the country and requiring huge
quantities of the nation's already depleted nonrenewable resources. 
While the United States has had many opportunities to build an efficient
and comprehensive designed transportation system, the representatives of
the government with the guidance of vested interests gave more credence
to spending $11-$12 trillion on the parasitic folly of the Cold War and
escaping to the stars, another trillion dollar diversion.  The
government became more concerned with the unknown than the known
problems here on Earth such as overpopulation and the wasteful use of
natural resources.
<P>
<h3>THE PITFALLS OF GLOBALIZATION AND THE MARKET ORIENTED ECONOMY</h3>
<P>
Trade among nations of the world in one form or another has been
going on for centuries.  But with the industrial and technological
changes that have been taking place over the years, the economic and
industrial powers of the world have recognized that something had to be
done about what they considered obstacles in the way of economic growth
and development.  While multinational trade negotiations have been
taking place since World War II to liberalize trade agreements, now a
renewed and greater emphasis is being placed on global or world ``free''
trade and its remunerative potential in the scheme of world affairs. 
The advocates and supporters seem to think that global competitiveness
without any trade barriers, and the unimpaired flow of capital
investments is the wave of the future, and the United States has no
other choice than to take a leading role in this grandiose venture.
<P>
While the United States has become the largest exporter of goods and
services in the world, it also continues to import more goods and
services than it exports.  As a result of global ``free'' trade and a
market oriented economy, the United States has increased its imports to
the point where its trade deficits are the largest in the world and in
its history.  Yet, in spite of the country's ongoing huge trade
deficits, the entourage of the elitists of big business and government
officialdom (former and present) prevailed in the political arena with
the United States becoming a member of the World Trade Organization.  In
this new world order and changing times, the biggest beneficiaries of
world trade argued that the country must pursue a policy of
globalization and ``free'' trade to prevent the country from falling into
the protectionist past of the Great Depression era.  While not going as
far as declaring a panacea, some of the spokesmen for world ``free'' trade
made the claim and prediction that the standard of living of the nations
and the people would increase to as much as thirty percent.  (``The
cornucopia of resources that are being extracted, mined, and harvested
are so poorly distributed that 20 percent of the earth's people are
chronically hungry or starving, while the rest of the population,
largely in the North, control and consume 80 percent of the wealth.''
From The Ecology of Commerce by Paul Hawken.  Under the present economic
system most of the income and wealth is controlled and owned by the
small percentage at the top of the economic ladder.)
<P>
Those concerned organizations and groups that opposed the adoption of
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the ratification
of the World Trade Organization argued that these agreements would:
disregard any effective environmental standards; result in more plants
and jobs going overseas; cause competition with cheap foreign labor;
ignore social and human welfare; and the United States would lose its
autonomy.  Their opposition to the formation of the world and regional
trade alliances, confederations and blocs would have a detrimental
effect on the economy and the standard of living of the American people.
As usual, the multinationals and the power elite received a mandate to
continue with business-as-usual and laissez faire, not just in the
United States, but worldwide.
<P>
Adding to all the hoopla over ``free trade'', the President of the
United States made the claim that the formation of the North American
Free Trade Agreement would in a decade make the Americas the world's
largest market with more than 850 million consumers (customers), buying
$13 trillion worth of goods and services.  NAFTA, a trade agreement
between Canada, Mexico, and the United States, was supposed to be the
instrument to provide more jobs and prosperity for the people of North
America.  But before the ink was dry, the value of the Mexican peso went
into a free fall and became worthless, and, as a result, the financial
and currency exchange markets were hard hit with losses into the
billions of dollars.  At the time of the devaluation of the peso,
American companies lost as much as $10 billion in sales or about 16
percent of their exports of $60 billion to Mexico.  But, once again, the
United States made a loan of $50 billion to Mexico to shore up the peso,
and to take care of the American banks and to reassure companies doing
business that Mexico was now on track and they had nothing to be
concerned about.  Making the world safe and profitable for a world
market oriented economy and multinational enterprise seems to be the
fate of the American people.
<P>
One of the fallacious conclusions coming out of the idea of world
``free trade'' is the delusion of thinking that the quantity of population
(the numbers game) can be equated with a greater potential of sale of
goods and services, and a higher standard of living for all of the
people.  If this premise had any validity, this world now of 5.8
billion, and growing at 90-100 million people a year, would have created
a bonanza for business enterprise long ago, and the nations and the
people of the world would have been drowning in abundance and enjoying
perpetual prosperity.  After assessing the physical factors involved,
one would conclude that the present and uncontrollable growth of
population negates the possibility of any real and sustaining
improvement in the standard of living for millions of people. (About 20
percent of the population in the world today live in squalor and
hunger.)
<P>
The corporate financial and industrial multinationals are always
watchful and on the alert to invest and move into those countries or
regions of the world that present the greatest opportunities and
profitable potential and gain.  China, with a population of 1.2 billion
people and with the fastest growing economy, has all of a sudden become
a most favored nation among other countries of the world in spite of its
form of government and human rights record.  (The United States with a
Gross Domestic Product of $7 trillion has 40 million of its own
Americans living at or below the poverty level and millions of children
without the proper nutrition and living in substandard conditions.)  It
is rather ironic that China, as a trading partner with the United
States, already has a trade surplus amounting to billions of dollars. 
While the elite and the entrepreneurial class in China will be able to
buy many of the products and goods that are produced worldwide, the
future of China to catapult its economy into a market oriented bourgeois
state is highly improbable.  Demographics, arable land and geology will
determine and dominate China's future, not world trade based on
financial considerations.
<P>
The degradation of the land and the soil that is taking place
throughout the world has come to China with a vengeance.  While China's
industrial growth has increased 50 percent a year in over six years of
the 1990s, farm output has fallen for three straight years.  Fertile
acres of land are being replaced by plants and factories.  Modernization
is eclipsing a 5,000 year history of peasant agriculture.  According to
China's government statistics, its arable land has declined by more than
half in 40 years.  Each year China loses one county of land and gains
one county of population.  With 1/5th of the world's population, China
has only 1/15th of the world's arable land.  It is estimated that by
2000, China will have to import 90 million tons of grain, just to meet
that part of its food requirements, which is about half of today's world
grain exports.  But by then, the exporting countries of grain will have
to assess their own grain requirements to feed their own people.
<P>
If China with its population of 1.2 billion people were to increase
its consumption of goods, products and resources through global trade on
a scale and at the rate comparable to that of France, Germany, Japan and
the United States, the world would endure untold ecoenvironmental
devastation and resource loss of the highest magnitude.
<P>
In the book, <cite>Only One Earth</cite>, by Barbara Ward and Rene Dubos, they
bring out some rather startling information concerning world development
that deserves serious consideration.  ``It is estimated that if rapid
industrial development were to bring all of the world's people up to
today's average developed standards, most minerals would have to be
produced at a level five times higher than today.''  And with these
calculations, sources of zinc, copper, lead, and tin (along with other
mineral resources) would be used in a matter of two decades.  Not a very
encouraging outlook for the developing, underdeveloped or even the
developed industrial countries that have endorsed unlimited and
unrestricted world trade and economic expansion.
<P>
Over the years the industrial nations and the North have controlled,
exploited and consumed most of the natural resources of the world. 
Today, economic and financial imperialism has replaced colonial
imperialism with the financial institutions and government of the
industrial nations being the dominant brokers in most financial and
resource transactions and worldwide development.  As Colin Trudge
pointed out in his book, <cite>The Famine Business</cite>,
``The poor come off badly
in their trade with the rich, precisely because the rich are so rich. 
The inequality is self-perpetuating.''  And their dependence on those
front organizations such as The International Monetary Fund and the World
Bank (the austerity loan shark bank) has kept them in bondage to those
financial institutions controlled by the industrial nations of the
North.
<P>
If the United States and other nations that want to get away from
where trade is based only on financial considerations and remuneration,
a greater emphasis could be asserted on the advantages to all countries
through counter-trade, barter and co-production with other countries for
essential natural resources, materials, technological and scientific
exchanges without all of the complications that come from financial and
monetary considerations, and trade deficits that will cause an ``economic
earthquake.''
<P>
Such an arrangement would slow down the exploitation and voracious
consumption of the world's remaining natural resources just for the sake
of maintaining and perpetuating a market and an aristocratic economy and
form of government.  What good is world or regional trade if most of the
raw materials, food and goods produced go to the industrial nations and
do not include and spell out a specific plan toward greater
self-sufficiency and the distribution of the basics of life as a
priority among those countries that are being exploited, even in those
industrial nations that have poverty and squalor.  Any world, or
regional trade agreements, that do not include and put environmental and
a sustainable resource base as its prime objectives is doomed to
hastening its and the demise of modern civilization.
<P>
While the prevailing wisdom seems to be that trade lifts everyone's
standard of living, Charles McMillion, a consultant and contributing
editor of the Harvard Business Review, disagrees.  He contends that the
natural consequence of trade is the major reason why millions of
Americans have seen their income shrink over the past 20 years.  While
millions of new jobs have been created here in the last 20 years, most
of these new jobs, on net, have been in trade industries.  ``And what
this means over the past 20 years is a shift from highly productive
high-wage jobs to less productive, lower-wage jobs,'' he said.  And as
trade grows, we can expect to see more social turmoil and political
instability in the industrial nations as both worker and governments try
to cope with less money and purchasing power.  Who is going to buy all of
the things that are going to be produced?  He doesn't see any indication
that the cheap labor of the developing and Third World Nations is going
away any time soon.
<P>
While the political and power brokers in Washington contend that the
United States is on the threshold of an exporting boom, McMillion thinks
it is about time for the country to face up to reality.  The annual
trade deficit has been running around or over $150 billion for many
years.  ``Our trade position has collapsed,'' according to McMillion's
report.  At current rates, America's annual global merchandise trade
imbalance will approach $220 billion this year.  For the last quarter of
a century, the United States has run a trade deficit.  Merely making the
world safe for investments and promoting exports worldwide without a
balance in trade relations become a one-way street that can only lead
to a head-on collision and a dead end.
<P>
Managed or world ``free trade'' with all of the various alphabetical
abbreviations such as GATT, NAFTA, WTO, EU. ASEAM and subsidiaries have
been formed to promote greater world trade of exports and imports, and
to make it easier to shift money around the globe and give investments a
freer rein in international markets.  These world trade organizations
are controlled by multinational oligarchies with governments acting as
adjunct or pitch artists.  The 500 companies in the world control 25
percent of the world's gross output while employing only .05 of one
percent of the world's population.  Their revenues have a greater
turnover than the smallest 100 countries in the world.  (``The largest
1,000 companies in the U.S. account for over 60 percent of the GNP,
leaving a balance (spoils) to 11 million small businesses.  The average
large business is 16,500 times larger than the average small business.''
Paul Hawken, <cite>The Ecology of Commerce</cite>, Harper Business,
New York, N.Y.
1993.)  With their financial clout and connections, they are too
powerful to be held accountable and responsible.  The cost of the
degradation and the damage to the ecoenvironmental systems, to the air,
water and the resource base are never included in the gross or net
financial profits that come from global trade and transactions.  Global
trade within the framework of a monetary and market economy will only
accelerate the exploitation and use of the world's already diminished
and remaining resources.  Questioning and challenging the purpose behind
a market oriented economy, and the implementation of a viable
alternative, must have the highest priority now and in the future.
<P>
Nothing has had a more devastating impact upon the world's resource
base than the exponential growth of population worldwide.  At the
present rate of population growth, the world's population will jump from
the present 5.8 billion people to 8.9 billion by 2030.  The population
of the world is now growing at 100 million people each year.  The
carrying capacity of this finite Earth cannot sustain this rate of
population growth nor the present population.  By not implementing
measures to control the growth of population, about one-fifth or 20
percent of the world's population living in poverty and going hungry,
nothing can bring more social, economic and environmental problems and
upheaval than the present and future population of the nations of the
world.  With the rapid decline of food sources from disappearing arable
land and top soil, commercial and residential development, and when
major fishing areas throughout the world have reached or exceeded
natural limits, millions more of the population will be faced with
greater deficiencies to sustain and maintain the basic sustenance for
life. Massive food shortages and more food riots will become the norm. 
Future Green Revolutions with the scientific and technological fix will
not suffice to meet the food requirements of the population explosion
and have become too expensive, financially, resource or energy wise. 
Besides, the biggest gains from the Green Revolution have already been
realized.  The consequences could be catastrophic unless there is a bold
and comprehensive long-term plan designed and implemented to meet this
exigency now.
<P>
<H3>ENERGY MAKES THE WORLD GO AROUND</H3>
<P>
The production and the use of energy, the ever-increasing mining of
the subsoil wealth, the amount of waste being generated, along with the
growth in the population worldwide, are important factors that cannot be
ignored in any industrial activity and the global economy.  Over the
last quarter century, there have been vast changes in the production and
consumption of energy.  World consumption of commercial energy to meet
the burgeoning rate of growth and development has increased 35 percent
with the bulk of the production and consumption being in solid and
gaseous fuels.
<P>
The United States is not only the largest producer of commercial
energy, it is also the largest consumer.  Though its per capita of
commercial energy has declined by about 4 percent, its total consumption
has increased by 17 percent.  And at the same time, its energy use per
unit of economic output has declined 17 percent.  Still, the United
States per capita consumption of 320 gigajoules is over 35 times that of
India (9 gigajoules) and 14 times that of China (23 gigajoules).  In
comparison with the U.S., 19 countries, 16 of them in Africa, use less
than 1.5 gigajoules of commercial energy per capita.  The United States
uses more energy than any of the industrial nations.
<P>
To get some idea of the magnitude of the energy and other resources
used by the industrial countries alone:  The industrial nations use over
70 percent of the world's resources with only 20 percent of the world's
population, and the United States consumes 30 percent of the world's
resources with only 6 percent of the world's population.  The U.S. has
the largest per capita consumption of energy and other resources in the
world, yet it is a net importer of oil and depends on the mineral
production nations for most of its essential minerals that are required
to operate its industrial, infrastructural and social complex.
<P>
The United States is now the third largest country in the world in
population.  In 1790 the population of the U.S. came to about 4 million
people.  By 1900 the nation's population had increased to over 76
million.  At the present rate of population growth, now at over 264
million, it will pass 400 million by the year 2050. At the present time
the U.S. allows 800,000 immigrants into the country to become American
citizens each year while at the same time thousands of illegal
immigrants keep coming into the country for economic or other reasons,
which adds to one of the most pressing problems that confronts this
country and the world.  As Carlo M. Cipolla wrote in his book, The
Economic History of Population, ``We are living through this fabulous
dissipation.''  But for how long?  As has been stated, ``If we breed like
rabbits, we will have to die like rabbits.''
<P>
If the consumption of energy continues at the present rate to meet
the ever increasing expansion and development that the present economy
depends on for its existence, where will all of the other natural
resources come from to maintain the gluttonous appetite of this economic
structure, and to operate the social and industrial mechanism with its
billions of horsepower prime movers?  What will be the impact on the
environment and ecosystems?  How will it be possible just to meet the
basic needs of the world's growing population?  What additional effect
will the increasing use of energy have on the already deteriorating
state of the infrastructure?  And the health of the people and the
nations of the world?
<P>
<H3>DECELERATING THE RACE TOWARD EXTINCTION</H3>
<P>
Before going ahead pell-mell with unlimited growth and development,
worldwide trade imbalances, and continuing to exploit the earth's
resources as if they are inexhaustible, and continuing on a collision
course with the environmental and natural habitat systems, it is of the
greatest urgency for all nations and governments to adopt and implement
a comprehensive long-term plan that will preserve the earth's remaining
resources and prevent any further degradation and destruction of the
resource base.
<P>
The need for a new effective strategy and a plan of inventiveness
that are compatible with the preservation of the earth's resources and
habitat from further degradation and destruction is long overdue. 
Considering what has been done in the past, it is doubtful that any
viable plan will be implemented within the framework of the present
superfinancial system, and where government officials and the power
brokers either represent or are in collusion with the institutions and
establishments that control the economic system.
<P>
All throughout history America and the other countries have found
themselves in a catch-22 situation.  Being hostages to the monetary and
financial system, countries are limited and forced to comply with the
rules and demands that are inherent in the present economic system.  As
a result, the dominant control for the largest exploitation and
consumption of the world's resources is by the North or the industrial
nations where most of the financial centers are located and operate. 
Unless this bondage can be broken, there will not be any effective and
viable change in the method of operating the social and economic
structure.  The natural resources will continue to be used in a wasteful
and haphazard manner merely for the meaningless purpose of perpetuating
pecuniary gain.
<P>
At this phase in history where the ever increasing magnitude of the
damage and destruction of the resource base of the United States and
other nations of the world goes on unabated, it becomes imperative to
our well-being to take those necessary steps to prevent this onslaught
before it engulfs us and before it reaches a point of no return.  Taking
into consideration the most important phases of history, the world is
now at its most crucial state.  As
<a href="../../../people/m-king-hubbert.html">M. King Hubbert</a>
(1903-1989) wrote so
distinctly in <cite>Energy From Fossil Fuels</cite>:  Perhaps the
foremost problem
facing mankind at the present is that of how to make the ``transition''
from the present exponential-growth phase to a near steady state of the
future by as noncatastrophic a progression as possible.
<P>
How much longer can this wanton and extravagant consumption of this
nation's and the world's resource reserves continue?  All of the
geological estimates are in the negative.
<P>
Maybe as the only ``superpower'' left in the world, the United States
could take the lead and set an example in a ``contraction'' instead of an
``expansion'' program or plan in the consumption of its and the world's
already depleted and rapidly shrinking natural resources.  With about
six percent of the world's population, the United States consumes about
30 percent or the highest percentage of the world's resources.  Needless
to say, the United States has the most inefficient and wasteful economic
and industrial system.
<P>
Considering that the United States has become dependent on other
nations for most of its essential minerals and oil and is the largest
debtor nation and has the highest trade deficit in the world, it would
be in its best interests and beneficial, resource or otherwise, for this
country and other nations in the world to recognize the futility of
their past policies.  There is no escaping the fact that the resources
of this Earth are finite, and the carrying capacity of any country or
region is limited.  More than anything, it is the responsibility of a
nation to put its own house in order.
<P>
At the present rate of economic expansion and growth, along with the
present and increasing rate of population growth, the United States
alone would need a much larger share of the world's output of
irreplaceable and renewable resources to maintain its industrial and
social operation and any growth and consumption.  For any economic
system that is predicated on growth and expansion for its existence, the
future of that system and the nation is fraught with difficulties and
problems of perpetuity.  It is impossible for any industrial and
technological society to expand at a compound rate for any period of
time without its bringing irreparable damage to the social and
industrial structure, and to the resource base of that nation and the
world.  In a high-energy and technological society as exists in the
United States, the American people and the government can no longer
afford to ignore that the laws of thermodynamics and matter and energy
are universal irrespective of ideology or form of government.
<P>
The present cyclical economy with its booms and busts, recessions and
depressions, panics and crises, and periods of prosperity, which provide
huge profits for the corporate ``power elite'', has never been able to
maintain a stable and viable economic operation nor provide what is
necessary to meet the essential physical requirements of the social and
technological mechanism.  Instead of the natural resources, technology
and know-how being mobilized for the purpose of maintaining a
sustainable economy and providing society with a high standard and
quality of life, most of the resources, technology and scientific
expertise of this country and the world have been misused to perpetuate
an economic system that is rapidly bleeding this Earth of its essential
resources and creating irretrievable conditions.
<P>
How long can the Earth's remaining resources last, or nations be able
to maintain some semblance of viability and sustainability with the
extravagance of the industrial nations and with the present rate of
population growth?  While economic and financial bankruptcy can be
prolonged by the creation of debt (including governments),
restructuring, and through financial and currency manipulation, and the
establishment of bankruptcy codes favoring megacorporations, forgiving
debts, taxing the American people to bail out financial institutions,
etc., natural resource bankruptcy is an entirely different matter.  Once
natural resources are burned, used or consumed, there is no way,
thermodynamically, of extracting perennial interest from them.  You
cannot eat your cake and still have it.
<P>
The decline and fall of a civilization does not happen suddenly, but
it is the result of many factors over the years of those pursuits and
methods that can have a devastating effect on the resource base and the
operations of any social and technological mechanism.  Every day that
this entrenched institutionalized system continues with the magnitude of
damage it does to the ecoenvironmental systems, and the resource cost
just to maintain this infrastructural maze of a hodge-podge, the chances
for survival become remote.  We must face the fact that we have
mortgaged the natural heritage to maintain and perpetuate an economic
anachronism.
<P>
Unless America and the other nations throughout the world can
disengage and make a complete break from the present monetary and market
system, which is based on unlimited growth and development for its
existence, and implement a method of operation or system that is in
harmony or compatible with physical reality and the limitations of this
finite planet, then the decay and decline of modern civilization and our
own demise become inevitable.
