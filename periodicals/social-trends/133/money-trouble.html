VOLTAIRE:  <i>In general, the art of government consists in
taking as much money as possible from one class of citizens to give to the
other.</i>

<p>
There are two subjects that will arouse and sustain interest in almost
anyone:  money and sex, in that order.  Perhaps this is because most people do
not have a satisfactory amount of either one.
<p>
There is plenty of literature on both subjects but very little basic
understanding available on either, especially on the subject of money.  Since
concern for money is such a national mania, a framework of understanding of it
needs to be presented both as to its history and the problems it is losing
today.
<p>
Until only a few years ago, money either was made of or represented the
relatively scarce metals, gold and silver.  The toil and sweat involved in
growing food, the craftsmanship of making something or the travail of providing
service for someone else was reflected in the choice of so-called precious
metals to represent money.
<p>
The Sumerians of ancient Babylonia are thought first to have made silver
bars to replace the barter system.  This change made it possible for persons to
accumulate credits against their society.  The more silver bars they possessed,
the more their society was indebted to them.
<p>
The Lydians, another ancient Asia Minor culture, are accredited with
coining money essentially as it is today.  Subdivision of money from silver
bars into smaller increments modified the money system of that day to make
smaller purchases possible and to refine accounting.
<p>
For thousands of years money in coined form was the means of distributing
a scarcity of goods and services.  <i>It cannot be over-emphasized that human
muscles and animal power, through all of this time, were getting the work done,
and that money, a figment of human imagination, represented to individuals the
reward for their back-breaking effort.  Man-hours of work were represented in
the "value" of goods and services.  </i>Of course, the more shrewd and greedy
quickly learned how to manipulate the backs and muscles of others to their
personal advantage.  They became the usurers we now refer to as bankers and
financiers.
<p>
As time progressed, and as more numbers of people appeared on the social
scene, it became more and more impractical for each individual to have his own
little store of gold and silver.  So deposit systems developed to store any
surplus where, presumably,  it was safer than in one's own possession.  Of
course this gave the deposit, or bank, owners the opportunity to speculate with
the money of other individuals.
<p>
Paper money and checks began to make their appearance in some quantity as
the Industrial Revolution developed.  Precious metals tended to become further
removed from individual use.  By the time of the American Revolution, European
banking and money handling were well advanced toward present-day
procedures.
<p>
When early American settlers first saw this continent, money was a rarity
among them.  A temporary return to barter was the order of the day for most of
them.  As society took form, after the American Revolutionary War, American
money made its appearance.  The dollar, however, contrary to what we are
taught, did not appear first in America.  The first use of the word "dollar" on
a coin was by the Sierra Leone Company in 1791 on the west coast of Africa
(another bit of evidence that George Washington did not throw a dollar across
the Potomac because dollars did not exist in America then).
<p>
What has happened to the American dollar in the past few years is rather
interesting in that it no longer in any way represents precious metals, either
gold or silver.  American money is merely paper that is redeemable for goods
and services, the price of which is arbitrarily set by government and
business.
<p>
In 1934 the New Deal administration made it a crime to own gold in minted
form.  All gold was called into the U.S. Treasury and paper certificates were
issued in place of the gold to represent equivalent dollars of purchasing
power. In 1966 gold backing of the dollar was eliminated completely.  Likewise,
silver backing of the dollar has been eliminated.  The fundamental reason for
these actions is that the volume of goods and services the U.S. economy can
produce is far greater than the precious metals available to cover their
so-called dollar "value."  From the money system standpoint, debt had to be
expanded far beyond the availability of these metals to validate this debt in
order to stimulate the flow of goods and services in the economy.  No economy
in the history of  humankind had ever before had this problem--too much in
goods and services for the money available to move to the consumer.  So came
"easy" time payments and a host of other devices, including war, to keep the
money system functioning.
<p>
The decline of precious metals in American coinage is continuing as the
coin supply becomes shorter and shorter partly due to hoarding.  Now copper and
nickel are replacing silver in coins.  In other words, American coins and money
in no way represent "value" in the sense that they did in the Sumerian and
Lydian cultures, in cultures today around the world or in our own culture of
just a few years ago.  The credit card and its association with data processing
is a further departure from the age-old concept of money.  The principal fight
of the money system right now is to somehow maintain the differential advantage
of income among individuals.  This notion is based on the preconception that
some individuals are worth more than others and therefore ought to
have more.
<p>
A basic question is:  If money once represented man-hours of toil in
producing goods and services under conditions of scarcity, what does it
represent in this economy where the work is being done by machines that have
produced an abundance?  The answer is:  Money today represents nothing more
than an invidious distinction between individuals and is an inefficient means
of moving goods and services.  Hardly anyone is "earning" a living these
days.
<p>
Abundance, as Technocracy has always pointed out, would eliminate the
money system in spite of any effort made to preserve the system.  Technology is
doing the work, not human sweat.  This course of events has a profound meaning
to the people of this continent.  This is the only civilization in the records
of history that literally is running out of money, in the historic meaning of
money, to move its goods and services.  A new measure of the flow of goods and
services, fortunately, is ready and waiting to replace money.
<p>
Technocracy's Energy Accounting design, which is a vastly superior "credit
card" for personal use, is designed to eliminate completely the bottlenecks
that money creates by impeding the flow of goods and services with the cash
register and other devices to collect money.  The Energy Accounting design will
measure the flow of energy required by the individual from North America's
industrial machine to enable the technologist to see that the people of this
continent get what they need and want, when and where they want it.
