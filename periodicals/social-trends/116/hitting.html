<p>
We can sympathize with children and their parents who must strike
them to maintain discipline. All are perfectly adjusted to the
society that has created them. All come into the world as
virtual clean slates, upon which adults promptly scribble a
disjointed value system fragmented with paradoxes, hypocrisy,
and contradictions. If our children lie, cheat, steal and hit,
it is an indictment of what they see in the world.
<p>
We teach them to hold hands, then in our blind rush to create
competitive drones, we engineer them for a world in which they
will be pitted against each other for a decent living. For the
sake of the sale, we bury their analytic and creative abilities
in regimentation, mindless nonparticipatory video drivel, and
do-it-for-me gimmick toys. When they emerge into a society that
fails to do it for them, they react. We have robbed them of
their sensibility by subjecting them to thud-and-grunt
gladiatorial contents and blood-and-guts sensationalism.
<p>
Our children ask why people go hungry while we destroy food.
They long for a clean world as we sell permits to pollute the
air.
<p>
We have glutted ourselves on resources in wasteful excess and
walked out of the restaurant patting our bellies, leaving our
children to pick up the enormous biological and financial tab.
Then we tell them of all the wonderful opportunities they have
to pay it, while the job base dwindles and real purchasing power
declines.
<p>
We have foisted upon our children a topsy-turvy world in which
if they are good, they might have a chance at decent housing,
food, clothing and medical care. If they are bad, they go to
jail and have all those things provided. If they are bad and
rich, they get it all and go free.
<p>
Swat 'em. Stuff 'em in jail. Reaction is easy. Reflection and
self-analysis are tough, for they bring up unsettling questions
about our own legitimacy as individuals and as a society.
<p>
In our technological age, our children are becoming less our own
and more reflective of society. If we don't like what we're
turning out, we should take a look at the factory.
<p>
Rather than smacking our kids, we need to smack ourselves awake
to the seeds we are sowing for the demise of our civilization.
