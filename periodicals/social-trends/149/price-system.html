<h3>ALWAYS WITH YOU</h3>
<p>
I have existed since the beginning of social life, yet few recognize
my fundamental characteristics.  Except for some minor civilizations
here and there, I am the only type of social system that has ever
existed.  I was conceived in human toil and scarcity, dedicated to
profit and waste.  I am the Price System.
<p>
Before recorded history I laid my foundation in the early tribal life
of humankind.  In the ancient world they called me Chattel Slavery.
During that long night of the human mind called the Dark Ages I was
known as Feudalism and Serfdom.  In the modern world I am called
Capitalism.  They even entitle me Democracy in certain nations.  Of
all my names, the most misleading is Communism.  My name has been
changed many times, but I have remained essentially the same in all
countries and all times...except that my techniques have improved.
<p>
For uncounted generations I have held sway over the bodies and minds
of people in every nation.  Today I exist all over the world in
various stages of development, controlling the production and exchange
of goods and services, and all the means whereby people live.
<p>
I am the group expression of humankind's common urge to live and prosper at
the expense of fellow humans and the environment.  I am the system
wherein everyone is forced to give as little to society as possible,
and take back as much as they can get.
<p>
I am the law of the jungle (eat or be eaten; kill or be killed),
projected by mankind into institutional forms. I am the lowest common
denominator of the ability, intelligence and necessities of
humankind.
<p>
<h3>HISTORY SPEAKS HIGHLY OF ME </h3>
<ul>
  <li>I am the Neolithic human who bartered pretty sea shells and rare
      stones for food and drink and a place by the fire.
  <li>I am the tribal medicine man who charged a fee for exorcising
      the devils.
  <li>I am the slaves of Egypt who built the pyramids and the pharaohs
      who were buried in them.
  <li>I am the oligarchy of Athens who poisoned Socrates.
  <li>I am the Judas who betrayed Christ and the Pharisees who crucified Him.
  <li>I am the legions of Rome who conquered Greece and the fanatics
      of the Christian Church who burned the library at Alexandria.
  <li>I am the Inquisition that persecuted Galileo.
  <li>I am the radicals of Paris who beheaded Lovoisier; ``The
      revolution has no need of chemists.''  How true, from my
      point of view.
  <li>I am Cortes and the Spanish Conquistadores who slaughtered the
      poorly armed Aztecs in Montezuma's Mexico, and I am the
      pioneering white settlers who did the same to the tribes of
      Native Americans.
</ul>
<p>
<h3>MOOD OF CONFESSION</h3>
<p>
Early in social life, I discovered that values are determined by human
desire and scarcity.  <em>Value</em> and <em>Scarcity</em> are my
cornerstones.
<p>
I dressed them up so no one would recognize them, and
baptized them <em>Supply</em> and <em>Demand</em>.  In this guise they
have befuddled people for ages.  And now, economists proclaim
<em>Supply</em> and <em>Demand</em> to be natural laws that dictate
prices.  This takes the moral blame off me, the Price System, and
creates the impression that nothing can be done about it.
<p>
<em>Supply</em> and <em>Demand</em> has been a useful myth for me.
Behind its cover I have always restricted the <em>Supply</em> and
never allowed <em>Demand</em> a free avenue of expression.  Actually,
there is no ceiling to <em>Supply</em> except ability to produce, and
no limit to <em>Demand</em> except ability to consume.  But I can't
afford to let it become widely known that economic laws are
<strong>not</strong> physical laws, neither measurable nor verifiable.
<p>
After this initial discovery, I needed more tools.  So, I invented a
promise.  I call it <em>Promise To Pay</em>.  <em>Promise To Pay</em>
cannot be seen, tested, heard, felt, nor measured.  I conjured it
out of nothing and planted it into the minds of people where it took
root and grew.
<p>
<em>Promise To Pay</em> was the first of a long list of operating
devices that I invented to facilitate my way of functioning.  These
devices were all conjured out of nothing, with no basis in physical
laws; yet they have become the rules of the game under which I
operate.
<p>
Next, so that no one would recognize the insubstantial nature of my
promise, I fashioned real tokens to represent it.  These I call
<em>Money</em>.  <em>Money</em> is the token of a promise; it is a debt
token.  It has no reality in itself.  
<p>
It seemed necessary to camouflage the real nature of <em>Money</em>, so
I gave it another name:  <em>Medium of Exchange</em>.  This has a
respectable sound, and besides, that is actually how <em>Money</em>
functions.  It is not, however, a medium of distribution, as some
of my apologists assert. I, the Price System, am not interested in
distribution.  I function solely to exchange goods and services <em>for
a profit</em> on the basis of scarcity-determined values.  Any
distribution that results is just a by-product.
<p>
It became apparent at
once that <em>Money</em> functioning as <em>Medium of Exchange </em>has
certain useful characteristics.  Money is negotiable, transferable,
interest-bearing, and it can be saved.  All this allows it to be
traded, stolen, given or gambled away, and since it is not a measure
of anything real or fixed, it can be devalued, revalued, and
manipulated in countless ways.  This variability is necessary to my
existence.  In addition, there must be an ever-present scarcity, else
values will collapse and there will be no basis for exchange.
<p>
<h3>I HAVE MUCH TO CONFESS</h3>
<p>
I soon discovered that there must always be a free flow of <em>Medium
of Exchange</em>, else the arteries of commerce dry up.  The way I am
organized, it is compulsory for the individual to accumulate as many
debt tokens as possible or else become a public charge.  Because
<em>Money</em> constitutes a debt claim against society at large, it
can be exchanged for any goods and services available.  <em>Money</em>
also constitutes a potential ``principal'' which can be hired out at
stipulated rates of increment (stated in terms of itself), thus
increasing in size and effectiveness.  When used in this way,
<em>Money</em> is called <em>Capital</em>.  Once an accumulation of
debt tokens has reached the proportions of <em>Capital</em>, it
becomes compulsory to keep it invested all the time, or else inflation
shrinks it back into the nothing from which it came.  It must increase
or die.
<p>
The flow of <em>Medium of Exchange</em> must not stop.  Before the
invention of <em>Medium of Exchange</em>, my activities had been
restricted to direct barter and outright theft.  I never outgrew these
time-tested methods of lightening the suckers' burden; I merely
graduated to improved techniques.  However, in hard times when a
situation calls for these primitive methods, I always seize the
opportunity to keep in practice.  There's nothing like having
something to fall back on should a rainy day come.
<p>
<h3>I BEGIN TO FEEL MY OATS</h3>
<p>
During my checkered career I have performed a complexity of
manipulations with <em>Medium of Exchange</em>. Dozens of schools of
economics have arisen around my antics, each claiming to have the
correct theory of <em>Money</em>.
<p>
The device of <em>Capital</em> allowed me to put into effect
<em>Delayed Exchanges</em>.  This opened a whole new world for
expansion.  I brought <em>Capital</em> and <em>Delayed Exchanges</em>
together in wedlock and they begat <em>Debt, Interest, Profits,</em>
and <em>Waste</em>.
<p>
<em>Debt</em> got bigger all the time.  His little brother,
<em>Interest</em>, accompanied him wherever he went.  Every so often
<em>Profits</em> got lost among <em>Delayed Exchanges</em>, but
<em>Debt</em> and <em>Interest</em> always went out and brought him
back.  <em>Waste</em> operated everywhere in expediting the turnover
of <em>Delayed Exchanges</em>, thus helping to maintain scarcity.
<p>
When <em>Delayed Exchanges</em> seemed to be turning over too slowly,
I brought <em>Waste and Profits</em> together in illicit relations.
They begat cheap substitutes and shoddy goods.  <em>Delayed
Exchanges</em> turned over much faster after that and
<em>Scarcity</em> became more pronounced.  This also kept <em>Medium
of Exchange</em> flowing.
<p>
But alas!  <em>Debt</em> turned out to be allergic to a natural enemy
called <em>Paid in Full</em>.  Every once in a while this pest showed
up and I was forced to create <em>New Debt</em>.  After some
experimentation I devised an improved type of debt called
<em>Long-Term Debt</em>.  He resisted <em>Paid in
Full</em> much better.  So with <em>Scarcity, Values, Promise to Pay,
Medium of Exchange, Capital, Delayed Exchanges, Interest, Debt,
Profits</em> and <em>Waste</em>, I was almost all set for an endlessly
successful career.
<p>
There remained two things to do.  I had to have an institutionalized
social structure superimposed upon these characteristics in order to
consolidate my gains and maintain law and order.  Also, it was
necessary for me to assume a camouflage so that people would take me
for everything else but what I actually was.  Radicals, liberals,
moralists and humanitarians have tinkered with my superimposed social
structures for ages without altering or affecting my basic
operating characteristics one bit.
<p>
To tell the truth, I did
not design these social institutions as one job.  They grew up
naturally over a period of time as a normal corollary of the basic
system of trade and commerce underneath.
<p>
In the very beginning of social life people came together in groups
for the purpose of multiplying their strength against opposing forces
of their environment.  Thus they obtained individual security more
effectively.  The paramount concern of the social state is supposed to
be the general welfare.  How I subverted social life from that purpose
is a story in itself.  It runs concurrently with the gradual
development of my operating tools for production and exchange of goods
and services.
<p>
Briefly, those who learned how to chisel according to the
opportunities provided within my framework became the ruling
oligarchy.  Everyone, of course, could not do so.  Only a minority.
For where there are exploiters, there must be some one or something to
exploit.
<p>
Throughout history I have been operated and controlled by three
oligarchies: the oligarchy of organized government to maintain law and
order, the oligarchy of the priesthood medicine men who preach
submission to me and reward after death, and the oligarchy of the
entrepreneurs who operate trade and commerce.  These three have either
controlled separately or together in all countries.  I name them
<em>Political State, Ecclesiasticism, </em>and <em>Private
Enterprise</em>.  Their role today is the same as it has always been.
Since the first concern of any government is to maintain itself, it
protects its own.  <em>Private Enterprise </em>functions to exploit
the natural resources of the land and people for all the profit the
traffic will bear.  It is easy to see how the interests of the three
oligarchies tie together.
<p>
<h3>SUCH STUFF AS DREAMS ARE MADE OF</h3>
<p>
The last factor that adds to my strength and resistance to change is
the set of sugar-coated <em>Abstract Concepts</em> that has been woven
into it by philosophers, historians and clergy.  I conjured most of
these empty ideas out of nothing and gave them names.  The readiness
of people to become enamored by visionary conceptions is truly
amazing.
<p>
<em>Abstract  Concepts </em>are composed of words&#151;symbols in the
mind&#151;that are not reflections of real things in the physical
world.  The minds of humans, in addition to being able to contain real
concepts, can also entertain an apparently limitless number of empty
symbols that represent nothing in the physical world at all.
<p>
This fact is one of my main props.  Over a period of time,
philosophers have invented thousands of <em>Abstract Concepts </em>to
intrigue the minds of humans.  Among these are Liberty, Freedom,
Equality, Fraternity, Justice, Natural Rights, Survival of the
Fittest, Right, Wrong, Morals, Ethics, and Sin.  People keep busy ever
seeking to gain or avoid them, often ignoring the physical world.  Try
to perform an operation to prove the existence of any of these
concepts in the physical world and see how far you get.
<p>
I love these <em>Abstract Concepts</em> because, not being physical
entities, they can be and are clothed in ever-shifting definitions.
The intensity of their hold upon the mind is so great, however, that
people will face blazing machine guns in defense of them even though
they don't exist.  Whether people will go so far in the furtherance of
<em>REAL</em> concepts remains to be seen.
<p>
<em>Abstract Concepts</em>help to conceal my real nature.  You can see
that in physical operations to produce goods and services, I conform
to physical laws.  But in the distribution of this physical wealth for
debt tokens, I ignore physical laws.  The control is carried on by
<em>Abstract Concepts</em>.  No wonder it jams up so much.
<p>
As I look back now I can see that my worst troubles began in 1782 A.D.
The first practical double-acting steam engine was developed then.
That application of extraneous energy began an increase in the
time-rate of doing work, which was to become a threat to the very
scarcity on which I depend.  Oh!  If only I had known then what I know
now!  I would have been more ruthless in my persecution of science.
But once rekindled, scientific knowledge grew and flourished.
<p>
<h3>I AM OUTFLANKED</h3>
<p>
By the time the 18th Century rolled around, this growing body of
knowledge had spawned the ``witches' brew'' of science&#151;the
scientific method and the scientific attitude.  Inventions were made.
Machinery came into being, crude and cumbersome at first, but more
efficient than my age-old methods of human toil and hand tools.  Some
unknown enemy of mine discovered that any motion that is repetitive
can be performed better by machinery than by human hands.  Then the
factory system of production was born and my arch enemy, Technology,
entered the picture.
<p>
Coincident with these developments came a greatly increased use of
power derived from sources outside the human body, such as coal, oil,
gas, wind and falling water.  Without this development, technology
would not have attained its present state.  The use of non-muscular
energy was new and revolutionary.
<p>
Throughout history the only source
of power available had been the human body supplemented by crude wind
and water wheels and work animals.  The only way to produce more was
to employ more workers or to work longer hours.  Now, the steam engine
developed many times the power of one person.  The Industrial
Revolution began, and I, poor fool, welcomed all this. 
<p>
Humankind has become dependent upon the machine.  The best I can hope
for now is to revert to some intermediate stage of development and
freeze there.  In fact, I have been staging an attempt in that
direction lately.  I call it ``Small is Beautiful.'' It is my
only hope against extinction.
<p>
<h3>MY UPHOLDERS ARE LEGION:</h3> 
<ul>
  <li>I am the aesthetes who revel in the delicacies of life that
      are beyond the reach of the great majority. 
  <li>I am the privileged few who are free to enjoy the fresh air,
      sunshine, green meadows, streams and mountains of North
      America&#151;the ones that are left, that is.
  <li>I am the whalers and the poachers who kill rare, endangered
      species for profit.
  <li>I am the hunters who slaughter baby Harp Seals in the name of
      fashion and vanity&#151;and profit.
  <li>I am the developers who see condominiums where others see open
      meadows and oak trees.
  <li>I am the grand mansions on the Avenue where they will try
      anything once.
  <li>I am the bleak, filthy slums where minds and bodies are dulled
      by incessant poverty.
</ul>
<a name="part2"> </a>
<p>
I am the Park Avenue playboy and the procurer who hangs around
taverns.  Their methods differ in degree but not in kind.
<p>
I am all the ``nice'', kind people of North America who want
to hang homosexuals and legislate pseudo-Christian morality.  How
their hearts can bleed for the poverty-stricken of other countries but
not for their own children.
<p>
I am the wealthy landowners and multinational corporate minds who make
conditions in Mexico and Central America ripe for revolution.  I am
the revolutionaries who gain power and then continue the miseries of
my system.
<p>
I am the farmer who throws milk in the gutter or leaves crops to rot
in the fields when the price is too low.
<p>
I am the housewife in a constant dither to keep up with the Joneses,
who hums an advertising jingle when she passes a product in the
store.
<p>
I am the father and mother who enslave their beloved children to their
own narrow horizons in the sacred name of parenthood.  My voice is
heard plainly in schools and colleges throughout the land, and my
schools help the parents enslave children to my <em>Abstract
Concepts.</em>
<p>
<h3>ABSTRACT CONCEPTS</h3>
<p>
I am the administrator who resists innovations in curriculum, and the
educator who knocks the creativity of children.
<p>
I am the teacher who complains about low pay and poor classroom
conditions, but who does not understand how people learn.
<p>
I am the law at the end of the police officer's nightstick, the
politician who tells him how far to go in enforcing the law, the hired
gunman and thug, and the stool-pigeon who puts the finger on my
scapegoats.  I operate the court systems that inveigle
``Justice'' over to the side with the most money.
I am the cash-register concept of social values of the smart business
person.
<p>
I am all the commercial escapisms of modern society from the moronic
TV shows to the equally moronic advertising industry that support
them.
<p>
I am the carefully controlled and orchestrated news media and the
advertisers who pay for it and censor it.
<p>
I am the sap who believes everything on TV.
<p>
I am the millions of adults and children in this country who cannot
read and write.
<p>
I am the miseducated, smart fool who knows all the wrong answers.
<p>
I am the banker who never knew anything about my commodity except how
to take a dollar and lend it out at the highest possible interest
rate.
<p>
I am the white-collar snobs, the vice-presidents and honorable stooges
who snub those in more plebeian walks of life, and the peasant
psychology of the underdog who looks up to society instead of around
at it.
<p>
I am the myriad of non-producing personnel in all industries who
thrive on the institutionalized red tape of my system.
<p>
I am the class hatred of the ideologists of dialectic materialism.
<p>
I am the cold warriors who guarantee security with a policy of mutually assured destruction.
<p>
I am the Watergate burglars and the President who fostered and covered
up their activities.
<p>
I am all the minority pressure groups, rich and poor, seeking
preferential advantage at the expense of everyone else.
<p>
I am the people's representatives who cater to these groups.
<p>
<h3>I GO ON A LONG SPREE</h3>
<p>
In the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, I enjoyed expansion as
never before.  I spread to the farthest corners of the earth.  I
modernized my operating characteristics and added refinements unknown
in simpler agrarian, handicraft ages.  Any debt merchant or economist
can reel off the list.  They study the pathology of my operating
devices (which you will remember were conjured out of nothing) without
ever questioning their reality.
<p>
When industrial expansion began, I saw at once that <em>Private
Enterprise </em>needed a few more <em>Abstract Concepts </em>to assist
it.  So I conjured up:  Live and Let Live, Competition is the Life of
Trade, Rugged Individualism, Invisible Hand, Social Darwinism,
Niggardliness of Nature, Law of Diminishing Returns and Free
Enterprise.
<p>
They sound beautiful and have furthered the confusion on which I depend; but I can assure you, they are as hollow as puff balls.
<p>
As <em>Political State</em> saw <em>Private Enterprise</em> expanding
into corporate enterprise, it had to modernize too.  So I added a set
of <em>Abstract Concepts</em> to it also, such as:  Political
Democracy, Voice of the People is the Voice of God, Government of Laws
and not of Men, Equality Before the Law, Freedom of the Press, Freedom
from Want, and Freedom from Fear.  Any politician can reel off the
list.  They're always spouting these <em>Abstract Concepts.</em>
<p>
These latter-day <em>Abstract Concepts </em>came in with the
Industrial Revolution.  They are now part and parcel of my operating
tools.  You will see, however, that they cannot be worn as clothes to
keep out the cold nor can they be eaten to nourish the body.  They are
in all respects negotiable the same as <em>Money.  </em>They can be
and are bought, sold and traded on the open political market.
<p>
<h3>MALTHUSIANISM OUTWITTED</h3>
<p>
One of the first effects of the Industrial Revolution was an upsurge
in population.  It was possible with the new power and technology to
produce more.  So it was possible for more people to stay alive.  This
trend has continued.  For the first hundred years or so it didn't
matter.  Industry was expanding.  Jobs and incomes were available.
The birth rate of new jobs was greater than the rate at which old jobs
were eliminated by technology.  The general welfare has not kept up
with the exploding population.  The birth rate of new jobs has long
since dropped below the death rate of old jobs.  Widespread hunger and
suffering have resulted.
<p>
Most of the world is still in the first or second stages of the
Industrial Revolution.  So it shouldn't be too hard for me to retard
social change there.  I, the <em>Price System, </em>can still operate
according to the old formula in most countries.  <em>Political State
</em>in every country is armed with a useful <em>Abstract Concept
</em>called <em>Nationalism</em> to oppose any unification of nations
based on location of natural resources (a logical physical criteria.)
The juju of my <em>Abstract Concepts </em>is captivating, even if they
themselves are not real.
<p>	
<h3>LOOK DOWN THAT LONESOME ROAD</h3>
<p>
As I survey the world today, I find that in North America I am in
extreme danger of liquidating myself in the very near future.  There,
technology and energy have advanced further than anywhere else.  The
operating devices that worked so well for so long in North America
don't seem to work any more.  No political ideologies nor economic
utopian nostrums can alter my basic operating characteristics one
bit. Their proponents make good scapegoats, but my real enemy is the
fact that I, the Price System, can not adjust myself today in North
America to the impact of technology and energy.
<p>
In the past when things got tough for me, I could start a war and
channel social change into homicidal conflict.  Today, corporate
enterprise particularly benefits greatly in time of war.  Prices rise,
business booms and profits mount higher.  <em>Political State</em>,
too, has an opportunity to expand its sphere of influence and
prerogatives.  <em>Ecclesiasticism</em>, of course, functions
on both sides.  As a general rule, the same can be said for
<em>Corporate Enterprise</em> in these days of international bankers,
cartel agreements and multi-national corporations. 
<p>
Technology, however, has made war too expensive for me.  Not that I
mind the killing, but the financial problems are a headache.  Worst of
all, modern wars are waged with the tools of technology, and (woe is
me) the tools of technology are the tools of social change.  In
America today the more technology and energy that are introduced, the
more insoluble my problem becomes.  They defeat my cornerstone purpose
of maintaining <em>Scarcity</em> and <em>Values.</em>
<p>
The installation of ever more new and efficient technology in North
America also dries up the free flow of <em>Medium of Exchange</em>.
You see, as more efficient mechanisms are introduced, jobs become
automated.  This spells disemployment of labor and decline of total
purchasing power.  In other words, more people get laid off and thus
have less <em>Money </em>to spend.  This means <em>Private Enterprise
</em>produces less and sells less. As <em>Private Enterprise
</em>produces less, more people lose their jobs and their spending
money.  It's a vicious circle.
<p>
So it becomes necessary to create ever more <em>New Debt</em> to pay
for the installation of still more efficient mechanisms to cut the
costs of production and grab a share of the dwindling market.
<p>
<h3>I HAVE TO EXPAND OR CONTRACT</h3>
<p>
I have my economists tell people that growth of production is the only
way to cope with the situation.  However, new technology increases
<em>Profits</em>, but it makes it ever more difficult to reinvest
<em>Profits</em>.  This takes place despite my best efforts at Monopoly
Control, Restricted Production, High Prices, Shoddy Goods, Buried
Patents, Cartel Agreements, and Financial and Political Interference.
<em>Private Enterprise </em>very easily out-produces its ability to
sell the goods it makes.  Reinvestment in new industry becomes ever
more necessary and ever more difficult.
<p>
From 1860 to 1914 in North America my <em>Debt</em> was always
healthy.  Since 1914 the reverse has been the case.  Physical
production has been leveling off, but <em>Debt </em>is going straight
up into the high heavens.
<p>
About 1932, <em>Private Enterprise</em> gave up the struggle to create
<em>New Debt</em> and passed that responsibility over to <em>Political
State</em>.  This lieutenant of mine, strong as he is, now barely
staggers along under the growing load.  With all the people being
disemployed by technology, <em>Political State</em> has become the
largest single employer and dispenser of <em>Medium of Exchange</em>.
It had to employ people by providing jobs that do nothing productive,
so as not to compete with <em>Private Enterprise</em>.  Many jobs are
in the military arms race, or <em>Political State </em>simply hands
out <em>Money</em>.  To pay for all this, <em>Political State </em>has
to increase taxes and create <em>New Debt</em>.
<p>
Since <em>Private Enterprise </em>dumped its <em>Debt</em>-creating
prerogative onto <em>Political State</em>, the curve of industrial
production has been following the curve of government spending.  It's
not a problem of finance; it's a problem of how to maintain physical
production at a high level so as to create jobs and maintain
purchasing power and the free flow of <em>Medium of Exchange</em>.
If I allow physical production to be maintained at a high level, I
destroy <em>Scarcity,</em> I dry up the flow 
of <em>Medium of Exchange </em>and have to create more
<em>New Debt</em>. No matter which way I turn in North America there
is an impasse.  Oh, riddle of riddles!  What can I do? 
<p>
Perhaps I can solve that one particular problem at least.
<em>Debt</em>, if you remember, is created out of nothing.  It can
also be dissolved back into nothing.  It's called hyper-inflation.
<em>Political State </em>increased the amount of <em>Money </em>in
circulation until it became dirt cheap.  So the debtor takes this
legally inflated <em>Money </em>to his creditor and pays off his
<em>Debts </em>at a fraction of their former worth.  It's a legal
swindle, but so what!  I told you, <em>Debt </em>is conjured out of
nothing, didn't I?  Well, when inflation gets out of control,
<em>Private Enterprise </em>performs hari kari for the good of all
(it's called a depression), and then I start all over again with a
brand new <em>Private Enterprise</em>.
<p>
In North America the problem of production is solved.  The new
technology is already installed and can do the job of distributing
goods and services for everyone whenever my interference controls are
removed.  My problem is to stall this off as long as possible and to
devise ways and means to freeze social change on a low level.  I don't
care if it does involve killing off 50 percent to 75 percent of the
population of North America.  What is that compared to my beloved
oligarchies:  <em>Private Enterprise, Political State </em>and
<em>Ecclesiastics?</em> 
<p>
<h3>THE END JUSTIFIES THE MEANS </h3>
<p>
Since I was conceived in <em>Scarcity</em> and dedicated to
<em>Waste</em>, I am utterly without scruples.  I know very well that
the prosperity I have been enjoying now in North America is only
transitory.  I know that it has been bought at the terrific risk of
installing a greatly expanded technology.
<p>
I know that scientists and
engineers have been analyzing my operating characteristics and have
pointed out every flaw.  I know, too, that a more efficient social
system has been designed that <em>will </em>distribute a high standard
of living and security to <em>everyone</em>.  But even though I know
the handwriting is on the wall, I have not lost hope.  My collapse and
the victory of technology is not inevitable.
<p>
If I cannot rule, I can always ruin.  If I go down, I may be able to
arrange things so as to carry all civilization in North America with
me.  But even if chaos results, I will not disappear.  Out of the
chaos I will rise again like the Phoenix from its own ashes.  For I
have been with you a long time and have learned many tricks.  History
records the disappearance of eight different civilizations of the
past.  The causes are obscured in the mists of antiquity, but history
has never yet recorded one single collapse of trade and commerce,
Price System basics.
<p>
There is only one thing that can liquidate me permanently.  That is
the replacement of my Price System methods of control by a system of
technological controls devised out of the <em>Reality </em>of physical
laws.  But it has never been done before.  And due to the nature of
technology, it must be accomplished <em>peacefully</em>.  How
difficult this is going to be, a glance at my record will reveal.  I
loathe peace.  As I look into the immediate future I can gather
strength from the realization that I am not alone.  For I have many
able allies who work unceasingly in my interests.  Some of them have
been with me a long time.
<p>
<h3>YES. . . I AM THE PRICE SYSTEM</h3>
<p>
I am the social system and institutions designed to fit the agrarian,
handicraft cultures of other lands, imported from across the ocean and
superimposed upon the great advanced technology of North America.  I
am the folklore and the hoary traditions of over 7,000 years of human
toil, hand tools and <em>Scarcity</em>.
<p>
I am the seminar leader who helps people overcome their personal
inadequacies so they can deal with me more effectively, people who
never envision a society without my operating characteristics.
<p>
I am the avant-garde physicist who questions Newton's clockwork
mechanistic view of matter and energy, but who fails to question the
reality of my <em>Abstract Concepts</em>.
<p>
I am all the ``return-to-the-land'' folks who glorify human toil and
think the path to a new age can be paved without modern technology,
leaving me free to continue to diminish the quality of life.
<p>
I can't afford to let them know the difference between my methods and
the method of science.  As long as people confuse science and
technology with Price System methods, they will be able allies should
I need to destroy the technology.
<p>
I am the ``common sense'' of the ignorant crowd, and all the
superstitions of the unknown.
<p>
I am the incalculable inertia of the great mass of people who never do
anything about anything unless they are driven to it.
<p>
I am every chiseler looking for a sucker, and every sucker who would
like to be a chiseler.
<p>
I am everyone everywhere with a hamburger sandwich psychology of
living standards in the richest continent on earth.
<p>
I am all those who know better but who do nothing about it.
<p>
I am you reading this article.  What have you ever done that conflicts
with my interests?
<p>
With such able allies, it will not be easy for technology to effect my
collapse.
<p>
I am the Price System!
