<p>
Of all the built-in flaws of our economic system, the ramifications of
money and credit are the least comprehended.  Yet, without a basic
understanding of the whole private banking complex, there can be no
working grasp of the capitalistic structure.  The tentacles of the
banking octopus reach into every cranny and crossroads in this nation.
There is not a man, woman or child who escapes the direct effects of
its economic strangulation.
<p>
It is one of the paradoxes of civilization that money is the one thing
that is needed, and used, by more people than anything else, while it
is at the same time, the least understood by them.  There is no object
more desperately sought for every minute of a person's life.  Man will
labor until aching muscles prevent sleep, he will put his life at
stake, he will steal and commit murder in order to acquire it.  How
strange that he evinces such little interest in understanding <b>what
</b>money is, <b>how </b>it is created<b>, </b>and<b> who </b>controls
the amount in circulation!
<p>
The answer, of course, lies in the fact that the average citizen has
been conditioned to accept that the whole subject of money is too
complex for his feeble brain to comprehend.  He is unaware that the
complexities and mysteries enshrouding the money question, and banking
generally, have been promoted with premeditated design that the
economic and financial enslavement of all citizens might go
undetected.
<p>
This is not to say that all bankers, especially the employees of the
banking business, are themselves dishonest, or conscious destroyers of
the public will.  It is to say that a monetary system, now so
widespread as to be unquestioningly accepted, has been deliberately
fostered, promoted and put over through the years by persons obsessed
by the desire for personal power and profit, coupled with a complete
indifference to the well-being of the rest of mankind.  They have
capitalized on the ordinary man's innate honesty and credulity to the
point where the philosophy of the unscrupulous has become generally
accepted as the right one, the respectable one, the desirable one.
<p>
Belatedly, the people must awaken to the realization that there cannot
be any social reform, any ability for the citizenry as a whole to
purchase all that the nation can produce, without fundamental monetary
reform.  A sovereign people who want to enjoy the full fruits of their
hard work, who want to see their children free from needless
indebtedness, and who want to build a nation commensurate with its
technological potential must break the power of the nation's private
debt-merchants.
<p>
It is sheer folly and blindness to seek economic well-being and social
justice without confronting four-square the unyielding barrier of an
archaic money supply.
<p>
The first enlightenment that must come to the people is that the
private banking system of the present operates on the same fallacious
principle as that of its progenitor, the 17th century goldsmith
bankers.  These were the private bankers who did largely all the
banking of Western Europe.  It was they who accidentally discovered
the ruse of &quot;fractional reserve&quot; lending.  Up the centuries
it was to serve as the foundation for all private banking.
<p>
The goldsmiths were the custodians of gold.  Those who owned the
&quot;precious&quot; metal brought it to them for safe keeping.  For
each amount of gold deposited the goldsmiths gave the depositor a
receipt that could be presented at any time and the amount of gold
withdrawn.  However, owners of the gold found that it was easier to
exchange the receipts themselves in conducting their business than to
disturb the gold in the vaults of the goldsmiths.  In fact, only a
very small percentage ever came to actually redeem their receipts.
Consequently the receipts circulated as &quot;money&quot; with no
thought, or suspicion, by either buyer or seller, as to lack of any
gold backing.
<p>
It was this circumstance that led the goldsmith bankers to the cunning
and deceptive principle of &quot;fractional reserve&quot; banking.  If
the larger number of those who possessed the receipts for the
deposited gold did not come in and claim their actual gold, what
prevented the goldsmiths from loaning out the depositor's gold to
others?  In fact, what prevented the goldsmiths from writing out
receipts for which no gold even existed?  Who would be the wiser as
long as they, the goldsmiths, simply maintained in their vaults
sufficient gold to meet the claims of the small number who did present
their receipts for gold payment?
<p>
This is exactly what the goldsmiths proceeded to do.  They commenced
<b>to manufacture </b>money, issuing receipts that neither had any
gold backing nor were backed by either goods or services.  They simply
used the depositor's gold, not their own, as a fractional reserve
against which to create fictitious receipts to be loaned out in the
form of interest-bearing debt.  Thus was born the <b>fractional
reserve system </b>of private banking.
<p>
There is a long evolving history of private banking from the time of
the goldsmiths to the Federal Reserve System of this Twentieth
Century.  However, it is a consistent history of private bankers using
a deceptive form of &quot;reserves&quot; upon which they could
increase manifold the money supply by the simple expedient of
manufacturing &quot;money&quot; or &quot;credit.&quot;  More serious
is the fact that all such artificial purchasing power has been put
into circulation in the form of debt--obligating the people and their
government with perpetual interest-bearing liens against both property
and future labor.
<p>
The power to expand the money supply automatically carried with it the
power to contract the supply.  Thus, the power to inflate and deflate
the amount of money has consistently given the private bankers the
power to destroy the purchasing value of money, affect the price of
every product and service, concentrate the assets of the nation in the
hands of a minority, and arbitrarily cause depressions at will.
<p>
It was this power that Mayer Amschel Rothschild, the founder of the
notorious Rothschild International Bankers, referred to when he
boasted, &quot;Permit me to issue and control the money of a nation,
and I do not care who makes its laws.&quot;  He knew, as he and his
five sons so devastatingly proved, that no people, not even government
itself, can go contrary to the dictates of those who control a
nation's money supply.
<p>
History reveals a constant struggle by governments, and their
citizens, to limit the power wielded by private bankers.  So powerful
have the bankers been, and so beholden have governments been to the
bankers, that at no time has any major nation been successful in
setting up an honest and adequate money system that was solely under
the jurisdiction of the sovereign people.
<p>
Unfortunately, it has always been the ignorance of the people and the
supine indifference of their representatives and government that have
permitted a minority to usurp the issuance and control of money--a
function that belongs exclusively and absolutely to the people through
their government.
<p>
Space is far too short in one chapter, or for that matter in a book,
to delve into the chronological history of money and banking in this
nation.  However, we should first note that the framers of the
Constitution did specifically intend that the power to control the
nation's money should be retained in the hands of the people through
the Congress.  Article I, Section 8, Part 5 of the Constitution
states, &quot;<i>Congress shall have power to coin money, regulate the
value thereof, and of  foreign coin.</i>&quot;  While only the word
&quot;coin&quot; was used, because there were no banks of issue at the
time, the Supreme Court has upheld the proposition that &quot;whatever
power there is over the currency is vested in the Congress.&quot;
<p>
The extension of banking control over the economies of all nations has
been simply the process of bankers securely entrenched in one nation
extending credit, or making their hoarded wealth available, to other
nations.  Invariably, this process has been the most effective in the
case of undeveloped nations or in the time of governments caught in
the throes of war.  So it was with our own nation.  While the
colonists saw the wisdom of issuing their own sovereign money, they
were prohibited from doing so by the tyrannical government of George
III.  By the time they had won their independence, they were at the
mercy of both foreign credit and American speculators who owned the
main indebtedness of the new nation.
<p>
Within two years after the adoption of the Constitution in 1791, our
own nation was placed in the clutches of private banking.  It was
engineered by  Alexander Hamilton and the international financiers for
whom he was spokesman.  It was accomplished by the enactment of the
First National Bank Act that gave birth, with the very inception of
our Republic, to the deceitful philosophy that the only
&quot;sound&quot; money is debt-money.
<p>
Unsuspectingly, the nation had agreed to turn over to the private
bankers the nation's bonds, or credit of the whole citizenry, as a
&quot;funding&quot; of the existing debt, then allowing the bankers to
issue bank notes on the government bonds.  Not only was the power to
control the amount of money in circulation placed in private hands but
to them was extended the privilege of collecting interest on both the
government bonds and the new &quot;money&quot; that they created in
the form of loans.
<p>
Thus was born the gigantic piece of monetary chicanery that holds sway
to the present.  Stripped to stark nakedness, it stands exposed as a
monument to mankind's naivete in protecting both his hard work and the
products of his labor.  And what does such a major deceit encompass?
It encompasses the acceptance that while a nation's bonds--secured by
the whole nation--and the private citizen's assets and working
capacity, are sufficient for the private banks to issue money and make
loans, those same bonds, assets and working capacity are not
sufficient for a sovereign people themselves to put money directly
into circulation without incurring any debt or without paying any
vampiristic tribute called interest.
<p>
<h4><a name="part2">Founding Fathers Grapple with Private Banking</a></h4>
<p>
For over 175 years a developing nation was to be burdened with
needless debt and have both its industry and commerce servile to the
manipulations of debt-merchants.  However, our forefathers were by no
means unmindful of what was happening.  In vain they pitted their
opposition to the private banking interests that wielded too much
power even in the nation's infancy.
<p>
Consider the reaction of Thomas Jefferson who authored the Declaration
of Independence, was the Republic's third President, and was the
nation's staunchest pleader for a democratic society.  In a letter to
John Taylor, he had this to say:
<blockquote>
<i>&quot; I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to
our liberties than standing armies.  Already they have raised up a
money aristocracy that has set the Government at defiance.  The
issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the
Government to whom it properly belongs.&quot;</i>
</blockquote>
<p>
Equally vehement in underscoring the fallacies and dangers inherent in
private control of the nation's money supply was President John Adams.
His reactions, summed up in a letter to Thomas Jefferson, have been
echoed up the entire history of our nation by those who have
investigated the money question.  Terse and to the point, Adams wrote:
<blockquote>
<i>&quot;All the perplexities, confusion and distress in America
arise, not from defects in their Constitution, not from want of honor
or virtue, so much as from downright ignorance of the nature of coin,
credit and circulation.</i>&quot;
</blockquote>
<p>
An ironical twist of events found Jefferson President of the nation at
the outbreak of the War of 1812.  So dependent was the nation for its
money supply on the private bankers that he was compelled to acquiesce
to the chartering of the Second Bank of the United States.  Twenty
years later, President Andrew Jackson vetoed the billthat would have
renewed the charter, which expired in 1836.  It is well to note that
under President Jackson's tenure the nation was free of all debt.
Under no administration, before or after, was the nation to be free of
needless interest-bearing indebtedness.
<p>
President Jackson, along with Jefferson and Adams, recognized the
stupidity of a sovereign nation making itself beholden to private
bankers for its supply of money.  Why should a nation that had just
won its political freedom become subservient to financial despots and
thus make a mockery of economic freedom?  In his farewell address of
March 4, 1837, he minced no words in making this indictment of the
privately owned central bank of issue:
<blockquote>
<i>&quot;In the hands of this formidable power, thus organized, was
also placed unlimited dominion over the amount of circulating  medium,
giving it the power to regulate the value of property and the fruits
of labor in every quarter of the Union, and to bestow prosperity or
bring ruin upon any city or section of the country as might best
comport with its own interest or policy....Yet, if you had not
conquered, the government would have passed from the hands of the many
to the hands of the few, and this organized  money power from its
secret conclave would have dictated the choice of your highest
officers and compelled you to make peace or war, as best suited their
wishes.  The forms of your government might for a time</i> have
<i>remained, but its living spirit would have departed from
it.&quot;</i>
</blockquote>
<p>
President Andrew Jackson had made a heroic gesture in trying to
liberate the nation from the stultifying and exploitative power of
private bankers but history must record it only as a gesture.  He
provided no sound alternative.  Government deposits were placed in
State banks that in turn used the public credit in a splurge of
reckless lending that led to widespread indebtedness and bank
failures.  Thus ensued the panic of 1837 with its attendant
foreclosures and inflated prices.  It was the first of the major money
panics that were to afflict the nation.
<p>
<b><i>LINCOLN'S &quot;GREENBACKS&quot;</i></b>
<p>
Of all  the outstanding men who make up the best of American history,
Abraham Lincoln, perhaps more clearly than anyone, understood how
wrong it is for anyone except government to issue the nation's money.
He did more than indict the unscrupulous private bankers and challenge
their unchecked power to place a whole nation in bondage and famish
its people.  He courageously gave the nation the only honest money its
citizens have ever enjoyed.
<p>
It was Lincoln who stated:
<blockquote>
&quot;<i>Money is the creature of law, and the creation of the
original issue of money should be maintained as an exclusive monopoly
of the National Government....The privilege of creating and issuing
money is not only the supreme prerogative of the Government, it is</i>
the <i>Government's greatest opportunity.&quot;</i>
</blockquote>
<p>
He took positive steps to fulfill his conviction.
<p>
During the early years of the Civil War, Lincoln through the Congress
succeeded in issuing $450,000,000 of United States legal tender notes
without one cent either of indebtedness or of interest incurred by the
nation.  Such Constitutional money was called &quot;greenbacks&quot;
and was secured by the assets of the entire United States.  Why need a
great and sovereign nation turn its credit over to private bankers to
be rented back in the form of interest-bearing indebtedness?  Couldn't
all of the nation's money supply, geared to its economic need, be
brought into existence without saddling the nation, or its people,
with liabilities for the use of its own credit and assets?  The answer
is emphatically affirmative, but the private usurers and bondsmen had
no disposition to tolerate a circumvention of their merry game of
siphoning off the wealth of the nation.
<p>
There is ample evidence leading one to believe that Lincoln signed his
own death warrant when he took the first bold step to abolish
financial servitude.  Whereas his Emancipation Proclamation decreed
the abolition of physical slavery for a large segment of the
population, his issuance of &quot;greenbacks&quot; decreed the
abolition of economic slavery for every man, woman and child in the
nation.  But ruthless and avaricious financiers were not to be
thwarted in their systematic sacking of the virgin territory and
untapped resources of America.
<p>
Not able to stop the issuance of nearly half a billion dollars in
Constitutional and sound money, the banking syndicate was successful
in placing a limitation on the &quot;greenbacks&quot; themselves.
Thus these notes bore upon their face the following:  &quot;This note
is a legal tender at its face value for all debts, public and private,
<b>except duties on imports and interest on the public debt.&quot;
</b>It was this exception clause that forced government and importers
to kowtow to private bankers and ultimately depreciated the
&quot;greenbacks.&quot;  In 1879, after all the depreciated greenbacks
had been bought up by financial speculators, Congress was induced to
pass a law that all the notes issued during the Civil War were to be
redeemed at face value in gold.  It was another triumph for the
nation's debt-merchants.
<p>
Lincoln's efforts not only to unmask but to destroy the Gargantuan
deceit of private banking were to no avail.  Nevertheless he had made
a valorous attempt to erase both over-burdening debt and pyramiding
interest from the economic lives of all the generations to follow.  He
recognized that debt and interest are cancerous growths that devalue
human toil, stifle progress and have no place in an equitable and
unfettered economy.  If Lincoln had been successful in introducing the
nation to a sound and honest money supply, the other built-in evils of
predatory capitalism would have crumbled.  One hundred years of
wholesale foreclosures, hardships, anguish and periodic economic
breakdowns would have been precluded.  But such was not the pattern
slated for America.
<p>
In 1863 the financial barons and usurers moved with a vengeance.
Holding over $2,600,000,000 of interest-bearing government bonds,
which the government had been forced to sell to the banks to
underwrite the costs of the Civil War, the bankers compelled the
passage of the National Bank Act.  The Congress was helpless to offer
any opposition.  Under the newly enacted law, the national banks were
granted the privilege of depositing their purchased bonds with the
Treasurer of the United States and then to issue up to 90% of those
bonds in bank notes to private borrowers.  Thus on precisely the same
money they collected 6% interest on the bonds themselves and a similar
interest, usually more, on the private bank notes they
&quot;manufactured.&quot;
<p>
From the time of the Civil War up to the present there is a perpetual
history of how private bankers and their syndicates have inveigled out
of Congress privileged and unconstitutional legislation giving them
despotic control of the nation's money supply.  No small part of their
intrigue involved their garnering of the gold and getting
Congressional sanction that any money issued by the government must be
redeemed in the precious metal owned by the private banks.  Thus they
could prevent the United States government from interfering with the
bankers' exclusive monopoly.
<p>
<h4><a name="part3">``Mystic'' Quality of Gold</a></h4>
<p>
Throughout the monetary history of this nation, the private banks have
promoted the calculated deception that gold is the only sound basis
for a nation's money supply.  The fact that such basis permitted them
to control the money supply simply by cornering the gold supply was
carefully kept from the people.  What should have registered with the
people with shocking impact is this challenging question:  If the
whole purpose of a money supply is to facilitate the exchange of goods
and services, and to provide for productive expansion, why then
shouldn't all money be related directly to those goods, services and
production?
<p>
What twisted reasoning dictates that a nation's progress and
well-being should be dependent on some mystic quality of a metal
instead of being directly dependent on the natural resources, manpower
and ingenuity of the whole nation and its people?
<p>
Not having any understanding of how his money was created, or more
importantly, how the amount of money was arbitrarily determined, the
average citizen has unsuspectingly accepted the promoted fiction that
both his cash and checks were backed by gold.  While it is true that
prior to 1934 the legal promise existed to convert both currency and
bank deposits into gold, no such amount of gold has actually existed.
<p>
For example, when the Federal Reserve was organized in 1914, the total
deposits and currency in circulation amounted to 20 billion dollars,
but there was only 1.6 billion dollars of monetary gold in the
country.  In other words, the amount of money in circulation was 12
times the amount of gold.  According to figures from the House
Committee on Banking and Currency, a similar proportion held true 50
years later in 1963.  At that time the money supply, both cash and
checks, totaled 157.4  billion dollars and the Treasury's gold was
only 15.6 billion dollars.
<p>
However, citing these figures is begging the point.  In 1934, the
private banking institutions succeeded in pushing through a law that
not only made it illegal to possess gold but no American citizen could
demand gold in exchange for his dollars.  As usual, of course, there
was an exemption for the non-American.  Foreigners holding American
credit could, through their banks, demand and have their dollars
converted into gold bullion.
<p>
From a private banking system based on useless bags of gold, we have
come supinely to accept an entire money supply based on debt.  Not one
person in a thousand, more likely, not one in a hundred thousand,
recognizes the hoax that private bankers have perpetrated on the
nation, its citizens and its government.  Unsuspectingly, the people
and their government have turned over their property and their earning
capacity to the private banks to be monetized and lent back to them in
the form of interest-bearing indebtedness.
<p>
Slowly but surely more people are beginning to recognize the
fallacious gimmick of fractional-reserve lending that permits the
private banks to grant loans five times or more the assets or reserves
of the bank itself. (And bear in mind that it is the people's credit
that makes the loans good.) All such granting of loans, or
credit-dollars, is nothing but the <b>manufacture </b>of money.  Every
time a loan is made, this is money that had no existence prior to its
creation by the private bank.
<p>
The arbitrary power to expand and contract the money supply, by the
making of loans or calling them in, has placed in the hands of the
private bankers the unhallowed power not only to change the purchasing
worth of the dollar but has given them the power literally to control
the amount of work the nation can perform.
<p>
The nation's entire working capacity has been made beholden to the whim and greed of those who are <b>nonproducers</b>.  
<h4>INFLATION  AND DEFLATION</h4>
<p>
The average American has little or no understanding of the causes
either of inflation or deflation of his nation's money and credit.
The fundamental causes of the erosion of the dollar entirely escapes
him because he has been purposely kept ignorant of how his nation's
debt-money functions.
<p>
The purpose now is to cast some light on the twin mysteries of
inflation and deflation, and to demonstrate how the real culprit of
destroyed purchasing power is the whole privately owned and controlled
banking system.  For, if a person doesn't grasp the mechanics of how
and why our money supply is systematically manipulated, there can be
no understanding of how billions of dollars in interest, foreclosed
property and savings are ruthlessly or callously wrested from the
people by private debt-merchants.
<p>
The fact to be recognized is that coins and all currency constitute
less than ten percent of the money supply.  Over ninety percent of all
the nation's monetary needs are provided for by credit in the form of
loans that create demand deposits or checking accounts.  It comes as a
total surprise to most Americans to learn that private banks do not
loan to borrowers other people's savings or the assets of the bank
itself.  Every credit-dollar that a commercial bank puts into
circulation in the form of loans is <b>new </b>money that has been
created.
<p>
At any given moment, the purchasing power of the people is the amount
of cash and checking accounts in existence.  In short, the law of
supply and demand applies explicitly to the purchasing value of the
unit &quot;dollar.&quot;  Increase the number of dollars in
circulation and there exist low prices and a <b>high </b>dollar.
<p>
It is the manipulation by first creating a cheap dollar, with all its
attendant ramifications of easy borrowing and increased indebtedness,
and then creating a high dollar, with all its attendant ramifications
of foreclosures and destroyed purchasing power - coupled with
&quot;administered&quot; prices - that has resulted in every major
depression and panic the nation has known since its inception.  The
toll paid by the American people throughout their history in hardship,
suffering and heartache is immeasurable in the wake of such financial
intrigue.
<p>
Startling as it may seem to most Americans, it is impossible, under
our present private money system, to have prosperity, with full
employment and full production, without a commensurate increase in
indebtedness.  It is impossible to get a single dollar of the very
lifeblood of our economic system into circulation without an
individual, or a corporation, or the government going into debt.  And
for the privilege of going into debt, each must pay a tribute to the
private Shylocks in the form of exorbitant interest!
<p>
At this point, it should be easy to observe that when the private
banking system commences to expand the money supply, making loans easy
to get, we have the condition of <b>inflation</b>, a lot of new credit
dollars in circulation, against which there are no existing goods and
services.  Immediately, there is a resurgence of business.  Production
is increased and the unemployed go to work.  New businesses are
commenced to produce new items, and general prosperity and good times
are at hand.
<p>
Parenthetically, however, we should note that the expansion of the
money supply has not added one iota to the nation's resources, has not
added one additional human being to the work force, or added one
scintilla to the nation's technological know-how.  Momentarily,
private banking has performed no other gesture than to release its
stranglehold on the nation's ability to produce.  However, the
&quot;magnanimity&quot; of its gesture is but prelude to the big steal
in the making.
<p>
At the point when the nation and its people are saddled with as much
indebtedness as &quot;the traffic will bear,&quot; the private banks
reverse their whole monetary policy.  They commence to call in their
loans and to restrict all spending.  In other words, they bring about
a condition of <b>deflation</b>.  A circumstance has now been
deliberately created in which the cash and credit in circulation is
less than the goods and services that are available for purchase.
Inventories become stagnant, people are thrown out of work, and the
whole nation has landed in a disastrous depression.
<p>
Witness now what has really happened to the people and their
government.  It is only a small part of the tragic picture to point
out the slowdown of the economy, the hunger, the millions unemployed.
The real crime of private banking is that while the people and their
government incurred their indebtedness during a period of inflation
when a dollar was cheap, they have now to pay off their debts with a
dollar that is high.  <b>Human effort throughout the whole spectrum of
the economy has been devalued.</b>
<p>
This is the harvest time for the private banks and lending
institutions.  Not only is there unavoidable wholesale foreclosure on
homes, farms and small businesses, but every dollar of both public and
private indebtedness must be paid back by future earnings made up of a
dollar representing increased human effort.  Hundreds of billions of
dollars are added to the coffers of the unscrupulous financiers by
thus inflating and deflating the nation's money supply.  It is a high
price that the people must pay to enjoy only a temporary prosperity.
It is the inevitable consequence of a money system that is based on
debt.
<p>
<h4><a name="part4">Vampiristic Interest</a></h4>
<p>
The power to inflate and deflate the money supply by arbitrarily
creating debt-dollars is only half the picture.  Equally devastating
to the economy, and thus affecting the lives of all the people, is the
whole spectrum of ruinous interest.  Every credit-dollar that is put
into circulation by the private commercial banks is in the form of
interest-bearing indebtedness.
<p>
In a few paragraphs it would be impossible to cover adequately this
evil which has plagued mankind up the centuries, an evil that all
major religions in their earliest histories both denounced and
forbade.  However, we should have a minimal grasp of the pyramiding
effect of interest in order to understand the impact it has on our
fortunes, our lives, and the stranglehold it currently exerts in
suffocating the whole economy.
<p>
We can get some idea of the billions of dollars, the hundreds of
billions, paid in interest solely on the public debt by considering
President Lincoln's issuance of &quot;green backs&quot; which were the
only &quot;money&quot; this nation has ever had without incurring debt
or interest.  If that $450,000,000, less than one-half billion
dollars, had been put into circulation by turning over to the private
banks interest-bearing bonds, the accumulated interest today,
according to computations by the Treasury Department, would be over 40
billion dollars.
<p>
Now give thought to a whole monetary history of the Federal government
beholden to private usurers for use of the nation's own credit.  The
magnitude of the interest charges on the Federal debt should be
apparent.  From a Federal debt of less than one billion dollars in
1800, the debt has risen to the current over-burdening amount of over
360 billion dollars.  It is a whole history of indebtedness with a
sovereign people naively paying the private bankers hundreds of
billions of dollars for use of the people's own credit.
<p>
Today the interest on the Federal debt alone is 16 billion dollars,
second only to national defense as the largest item in the national
budget.  If during the next 24 years there is no increase in
indebtedness, the accumulated interest on the Federal debt will exceed
the total amount of the principal, with the 360 billion dollars in
debt still burdening the nation and the people.
<p>
To get a glimpse into the astronomical amounts that the private banks
extort out of the economy is to consider two very simple facts.  The
first is that any amount of money loaned at 6% compound-interest
doubles itself every 12 years.  The second fact is that of geometric
progression, where if one takes a mere penny and doubles it, and then
doubles each total for thirty times, one will come up with the
incredible grand total of over 5 million dollars.  It is the foregoing
two facts, plus the fact that the vast bulk of loans by the private
banks are simply book entries and are not made up of the deposits of
others or assets of the bank itself, that makes interest-taking so
insidious, so pernicious, and so astronomical.
<p>
Perhaps we can get a sufficient appreciation of unmitigated
exploitation that is reflected in exorbitant interest charges by
considering a statistical table placed in the Congressional Record by
Representative Wright Patman on July 27, 1967.  This table covers the
interest paid on both the public and private debt for each year from
1951 to 1966.  The significance of the 15-year table is that it
compares what the interest would have been if interest rates had been
kept at the 1951 level.
<p>
In 1951, the total indebtedness, private and public, was 524 billion
dollars.  In 1966, the total indebtedness, private and public, had
pyramided to 1,368.3 billion dollars--over one and a third trillion
dollars.  During this 15-year period, the American people and their
government have paid in interest the staggering sum of 680.2 billion
dollars.  If the interest rates had not been unnecessarily increased,
the total interest paid would have been 468.5 billion dollars.
<p>
The net result is that from 1951 to 1966 the private banking system,
through the interest manipulation of the banker-dominated Federal
Reserve, extorted $211,700,000,000 (211.7 <b>billion </b>dollars) from
the citizenry.
<p>
Representative Patman, in presenting these official statistics, stated,
<blockquote>
These figures plainly establish that high interest rates have been a
burdensome tax on the low and moderate income families.  High interest
rates have deprived these people of huge chunks of their wages and at
the same time have prevented the construction of needed housing and
other works.
</blockquote>
<p>
He further commented:
<p>
<blockquote>
The Federal Reserve has acted as destructively as the worst of the
rioters.  And the resulting damage to the economy has far exceeded the
damage from all the riots.  The Federal Reserve's December 6, 1965
defiance of the President wiped out the chance to build 500,000 new
housing units in 1966--far more than have been burned or destroyed in
all the riots combined.
</blockquote>
<p>
To appreciate the magnitude of the excessive interest paid only in the
year 1966 is to make a comparison with farm income.  In so doing we
should realize that there are approximately 3.4 million farms, and
that these millions of farms are responsible for supplying the food
that nourishes all our citizens.  In addition, these millions of farms
provide much of the fibre used in making the nation's clothing.  Now
consider the fact that the excessive interest paid only in the year
1966, which was 36 billion dollars, was the same amount as the total
gross farm receipts from marketings in 1963.  Incredible as it might
seem, the <b>excessive interest </b>of nonproducers in one year was
equal to the <b>total output </b>of the nation's producers who sustain
life for 200,000,000 citizens!
<p>
Let's give some thought to the total of 211.7 billion dollars that
represents the excessive interest for the past fifteen years.  A
hypothetical construction project of building houses priced at $20,000
per unit would seem to give us a good yardstick.  As we construct each
50-foot house, we butt each next to the other with no space between.
For 211 billion dollars, how long a line of houses would we have
constructed?  We would have constructed a line of houses, each butted
against the next, going around the world four times.
<p>
While interest charges are involved in everything that is purchased,
in no area is its evil more apparent than in home buying.  However, in
too few cases, particularly the young couple desperate to get a home
of their own, are the buyers aware that they are the victims of a
merciless game of paying double the amount in human effort for value
received.  Month in and month out, during the best years of their
lives, the nation's homeowners are paying for two houses but receiving
only one.  In fact, the average couple is unaware that, because of
exorbitant interest charges, their home is depreciating faster than
they are able to reduce the mortgage.
<p>
Certainly, it should dawn on the nation's homeowners, or
home-builders, that they not only give a first mortgage on their home
to the bank but that it is their earning capacity that makes the loan
substantive.  In short, the average home-builder must pay the
voracious money-lender in interest an amount equal to the price of the
home for the use of the home-builder's own credit while the
money-lender doesn't as much as replace one shingle or plant one seed
of grass during a 25-year period of receiving payments.
<p>
There are no economic crimes against humanity comparable to the
diabolical power to manufacture a nation's money and to charge
tributes called interest.  A halt must be called to the whole
business.  The same element that makes the citizen's mortgage and the
government's bond good for the private banker is the same element that
would allow a sovereign people the right to provide for their own
monetary needs without either the burden of debt or interest.
<p>
<h4><a name="part5">Federal  Reserve System</a></h4>
<p>
In 1913 the Federal Reserve Act was passed.  Under the guise of setting
up a flexible money system that would meet the commercial and individual credit
needs of an expanding economy, the private bankers pushed through Congress a
system of money control that gave them despotic power in determining the whole
money supply of the nation.  Consequently, up here in the 1960s , a mere
handful of men, occupying the highest positions in the private banking complex,
exercise a life-and-death influence over the lives of every man, woman and
child far exceeding the combined power of both the President and the entire
Congress.
<p>
The key to an understanding of how the Federal Reserve System is
a private-banker-oriented and dominated autocracy is the fact that of the nine
directors of each of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks, six are elected by the
private member banks .  A questionnaire sent out in 1964 by the House Banking
and Currency Committee revealed that even of the 36 directors elected by the
Federal Reserve Board , 19 were, or had been connected with the private banking
industry.  In short, 91 out of the total 108 directors of the Federal Reserve
Banks had connections or associations with the private banks that they were
supposed to regulate.
<p>
The arrogant statement of William McChesney Martin before the Joint
Economic Committee of the U.S. Congress on February 26, 1965, should leave
little doubt as to the fact that it is the wishes of the private bankers that
the Board serves and not the people whose earnings and savings should be
protected.  Testifying before the Committee, Chairman Martin brazenly stated
that "the Federal Reserve Board has the authority to act independently of the
President," even "despite the President."  Ten months later, the Federal
Reserve Board demonstrated its self-proclaimed autocracy by
arbitrarily raising the interest rate despite the pleadings of
President Johnson to the contrary.
<p>
<h4>Open Market Committee</h4>
<p>
However, not the <i>Federal Reserve Board</i>, nor the <i>Federal
Reserve Banks</i>, are the real power over the nation's money.  The fundamental
and dictatorial monetary powers of the nation are exercised by a committee that
most Americans do not know even exists.  This is the <i>Open Market Committee
</i>that is made up technically of five<i> Federal Reserve Bank</i> presidents
and the seven members of the <i>Federal Reserve Board.</i>  However, all twelve
presidents of the <i>Federal Reserve Banks </i>participate in its
deliberations.
<p>
The <i>Open Market Committee </i>is not only the most powerful single
group of men in this nation, but perhaps in the world.  Meeting in secret,
immune from public auditing or disclosure  of the minutes of its meetings, its
operations of buying and selling government securities give it absolute and
autocratic control over the nation's entire money supply.  In the hands of this
Committee exists the power to inflate or deflate arbitrarily the amount of
money to conduct the over-all economy.  Through its actions literally billions
of dollars in interest and foreclosures flow into the private bankers' coffers
while at the same time the nation needlessly suffers economic breakdown,
unemployment, business stagnation and spiraling indebtedness.
<p>
There was no provision for the <i>Open Market Committee </i>in the
<i>Federal Reserve Act</i> of 1913.  The intent of the <i>Act </i>was to set up
twelve semi-autonomous Federal Banks that would provide the necessary reserves
for its members by monetizing the "eligible" short-term commercial paper,
thereby responding to business conditions and requirements of each regional
area of the nation.  The <i>Federal Reserve Board </i>would determine the
discount rates and interest rates, thus serving as a check on the amount of
reserves the commercial banks would have against which to make loans.
<p>
In less than ten years after the enactment of the <i>Act</i>, the powerful
private banks in the East had succeeded in thwarting the specific intent of the
<i>Federal Reserve System</i> by converting it into a central banking system by
the setting up of an <b>ad hoc </b>committee to coordinate the buying and
selling of government bonds.  Later they succeeded in pressuring Congress to
give legality to the <i>Open</i> <i>Market Committee</i> that gave the private
banks absolute control over the nation's money supply.
<p>
Today it has a portfolio of over 40 billion dollars in government bonds
that have been paid for once by the taxpayers with <i>Federal Reserve </i>notes
and therefore should be retired.  Instead these billions of dollars in
government securities continue to collect interest and are the primary source
of "reserves" for the commercial banks for placing the nation further and
further in debt.
<p>
<h4><a name="part6">Bankers Testify Under Oath</a></h4>
<p>
To those who are unacquainted with the ramifications of money control,
it may be a surprise to learn that shelf upon shelf of books have been written
upon the subject.  The incredible circumstance is that so much knowledge could
exist without sufficient people rising in enlightened protest to demand
monetary reform.
<p>
While there has been no dearth of information available on either the
forces or personalities behind money control or the diabolical power that they
have exercised, and do exercise, the real difficulty has been in getting large
enough numbers of people to accept the truth of the allegations.
<p>
One of the chief obstacles has been that most of the writings on, and analyses
of, money and banking have embodied very little direct testimony by bankers
themselves.  Thus the accused could continue to promote the doubt in the
reader's mind that the accusers were presenting an erroneous case.  Like the
yokel who saw a giraffe for the first time, the reader was conditioned to
react, "There just ain't such an animal!"
<p>
Of very recent times, a most fortunate development came to pass.  It was to
mark the end of any deceptive counteraction that those who were endeavoring to
awaken the people to the iniquitous machinations of private banking were
subverters of the public trust and advocates of "funny-money" schemes.  Out of
the mouths of bankers themselves, under oath, was to come the whole story of
the workings of their own nefarious system.
<p>
For the whole year of 1964, spring, summer and fall, a committee of the United
States Congress conducted extensive hearings into the operations of the Federal
Reserve system.  No aspect or ramification of the 50-year existence of the
nation's banking system was left unscrutinized.  It was the first time in the
history of the nation that a duly constituted Committee of Congress had so
penetratingly and thoroughly investigated the issuance and control of our whole
money supply.
<p>
The man who spearheaded the investigation was Representative Wright Patman of
Texas who is the Chairman of the House Committee on Banking and Currency, and
was also chairman of the Subcommittee on House Finance which was responsible
for the hearings.  It should be noted that Rep. Patman has been for 40 years
one of the nation's most knowledgeable and forceful critics of the privately
controlled Federal Reserve System.  He has stressed consistently that under the
Constitution it is the right and duty of Congress to create and control the
money supply and that under the Federal Reserve Act passed on December 13,
1913, and subsequent Acts, the absolute power over the nation's money has been
exercised by private bankers.
<p>
The hearings are too voluminous for the average person to read en toto.
However, for the scholar there is now available
an historic and documented record of how private banking operates and how the
nation's whole economy is despotically influenced by its actions.  Not only
were all the executives of the Federal Reserve System itself, the 12 presidents
of the Federal Reserve Banks and the seven members of the Federal Reserve
Board, meticulously interrogated but included as well were the Secretary of the
Treasury, officials of the General Accounting Office, representatives of the
American Bankers Association, the Independent Bankers Association and
representatives of the commercial banks.
<p>
Included also were dozens of experts representing a wide range of testimony.
Among them were the President of the Cooperative League, the research director
of the AFL-CIO, past advisors to Presidents Truman and Kennedy, and a number of
outstanding authorities on law, political economy and public administration.
In addition, many statements and exhibits were all made part of the hearings.
The three volumes entitled "<i>The Federal Reserve System After</i> <i>Fifty
Years</i>", which cover the hearings, fill over 2200 pages alone.  Corollary
volumes make a stack of priceless documentation over a foot high.
<p>
At the conclusion of the hearings the majority of members of the Subcommittee
made specific recommendations, and later introduced bills, for the express
purpose of reversing high interest rates and tight money, and curbing the
exorbitant power of the private banks which control the Federal Reserve System.
At this writing all such effort has been smothered by the pressure and
intimidation of the financial lobbies spearheaded by the American Bankers
Association.  Under no circumstances do they intend to tolerate legislative
interference with their monopolistic control of the nation's credit and money
supply.
<p>
The extent to which the banking lobbies will go is graphically borne out by
the attempted bribe of Representative Gonzales, a member of the Sub-committee
from Texas.  Representative Gonzales testified that he had been offered a
position on the Board of Directors of a bank coupled with a stock gift
amounting to $14,000.  One can only speculate as to how many elected
representatives, over the years, have succumbed to similar overtures of
bare-faced bribery.
<p>
Viewing our history in retrospect, it taxes the imagination to realize that a
young and fertile land, filled with such an energetic and ingenious people,
should have been betrayed so long to the connivings of those who were
non-producers.  How utterly incredible that debt-merchants, with nothing but
their garnered bags of gold, and their usurped power to create interest-bearing
debt, could so long systematically bilk a nation without an outraged citizenry
making them disgorge their unearned wealth and unearned claims!
<p>
The answer lies of course in a number of circumstances which we have alluded
to earlier.  Overridingly, it has been the circumstance of the majority of the
people caught in the throes of eking out an existence being too preoccupied to
enlighten themselves about the subject of money.  Others recognized that to
protest was to jeopardize their economic livelihood, besides having the stigma
attached to their person that they were advocates of "funny money."  There has
always been a penalty for being too brash in indicting the pernicious power of
private banking.
