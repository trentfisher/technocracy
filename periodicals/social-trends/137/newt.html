If choice of heroes is any indication of one's character, Newt Gingrich has
left little  doubt -- if there was any to leave -- as to where his interests
lie.
<p>
During a session of his bought-and- paid-for video soapbox, <i>Renewing
American Civilization</i>, (mind Extension University, Feb. 4, 1995), Gingrich
chose to single out an American who, to him, represents the ultimate meld of
American innovation and entrepreneurship:  inventor, Thomas Edison.  According
to Newtonian history, Edison, upon whom Gingrich heaps such accolades as
"hardworking" and "generous", symbolizes the spirit of inventiveness and
opportunism that helped shape America's ascendency to greatness, and one we
sorely need to revive in order to survive.
<p>
Has Newt plunged blissfully into laudation, unknowing that inventive as he may
have been, Edison, the businessman, was just as ruthless and cutthroat as any
entrepreneur ever that tried to corner a market?  Or are these the qualities
Gingrich sees as the saving grace of America?
<p>
Certainly Edison worked hard.  His two-hour catnaps between bouts with the
ardor of tinkering are legendary.  But if he wasn't jumping through hoops for
J. Pierpont Morgan, he was working just as hard at protecting his turf,
disarming challenges to his vested interests, undermining competition through a
highly efficient propaganda machine, and reneging on agreements.
<p>
It was this man, for whom Gingrich expresses such admiration, who summed up
his working principle and issued an indictment of American business in general
when he boasted, "Everybody steals in commerce in industry.  I've stolen a lot
myself.  But I know <i>how </i>to steal."
<p>
It was also this captain of industry who for years stonewalled electrical
wizard Nikola Tesla and his sponsor George Westinghouse's efforts on the
introduction of alternating current, a far more efficient means of providing
affordable electricity to millions of Americans, because Edison was heavily
invested in direct current.  As Tesla biographer Mary Cheney notes in <i>Tesla:
Man out of Time</i>, Edison would scour his Menlo Park neighborhood for cats
and dogs, which he would then electrocute with alternating current in showy
displays, rejoining the demonstrations with the admonition, "Is this what you
want the little wife cooking with?"
<p>
Tesla might also have argued convincingly about Edison's generosity.  Promised
$50,000 to redesign Edison's primitive direct current dynamos, Tesla called
upon the inventor almost a year later to collect on the completed job.  Edison
gazed at him open mouthed and expostulated, "Tesla, you don't understand our
American humor."
<p>
At best, Gingrich's admiration of Edison is based on a superficial survey of
the man's accomplishments.  At worst, if Newt is in possession of the facts as
a university professor should be, his praise of Edison is an endorsement of the
lowest of American business practice.
<p>
To be fair, Edison's tactics bear no substantial difference to corporate
intrigue at large.  Measured by these standards, Gingrich's Hall of Fame of
American enterprise would have to number such luminaries as the Goulds, the
Fisks, and the Vanderbilts, whose heroic exploits at railroad building
shattered the lives and cultures of thousands of displaced native Americans and
low-paid immigrant laborers (and whose efforts have consigned many of the
Indians' descendants to the welfare rolls Newt would so dearly love to
abolish).  And let's not forget the Rockefellers and the Firestones, who did
for oil and rubber what Tom did for electricity.  Nor can we ignore the
depredations of many of these contributors to the fabric of American commercial
culture who, through their machinations, were able to command sufficient
capital to create financial panics to add to their booty, while bringing the
workings of the country to a screeching halt.
<p>
America loves its celebrities.  All too often the corporate media Kliegs
spotlight the Edisons and bypass the bit players, the behind-the-scenes
innovators who do the legwork but lack the jugular instinct to enter the
entrepreneurial fray.  At any rate, the day of the adventurous innovator is
over.  Government research funding is at a nadir; researchers now merely
chattel to corporate masters, hireling paranoiacs toiling away on products not
necessarily necessary but products that may be sold to a befuddled public.  And
the hard work of which Gingrich is so fond culminates in a pink slip for senior
employees when their paychecks become liabilities.  The hard world of
competitive enterprise, which Gingrich and his ilk see as the salvation of
America, comes as a cold douche to idealistic researchers reared in an
atmosphere of cooperation, who are now forced to work looking over their
shoulders.
