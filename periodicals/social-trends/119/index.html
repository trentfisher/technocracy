<h3>Famous Quotations On Money</h3>
<p>
John Adams wrote to Thomas Jefferson in 1778:
<p>
``All the perplexities, confusion and distress in America arise,
not from defects in their Constitution or Confederation, not
from want of honor or virtue, so much as from the downright
ignorance of the nature of coin, credit and circulation.''
<p>
Thomas Jefferson said:
<p>
``If the American people ever allow private banks to control the
issue of their currency first by inflation and then by
deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around
them will deprive the people of all propertyuntil their children
will wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered.''
<p>
``I hope we shall crush in its birth the aristocracy of the
moneyed corporations, which dare already to challenge our
Government to trial of strength and bid defiance to the laws of
our country.'' (From Jefferson's letter to George Logan, November
1816.)
<p>
President Andrew Jackson said the following words to the
money changers who approached him in the drawing room of the
White House:
<p>
``Gentlemen, I have had men watching you for a long time and I am
convinced that you have used the funds of the bank to speculate
in the breadstuffs of the country.  When you won, you divided
the profits amongst you, and when you lost, you charged it to
the bank.  You tell me that if  I take the deposits from the
bank and annul its charter I shall ruin ten thousand families.
That may be true, gentlemen, but thatis your sin!  Should I let
you go on you will ruin fifty thousand families, and that would
be my sin!  You are a den of vipers and thieves.  I have
determined to rout you out, and by the Eternal God, I will rout
you out!''
<p>
James A. Garfield is reported to have said:
<p>
``Whoever controls the volume of money in any country is absolute
master of all industry and commerce.''
