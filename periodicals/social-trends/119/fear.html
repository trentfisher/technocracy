What else but fear accounts for almost all negative actions
carried out by the human race?
<p>
We allow aliens to immigrate to this country on the alleged
excuse they are politically persecuted and therefore need
asylum, which allows them to be called refugees: "those refugees
are afraid because they have no security intheir own country, so
they seek asylum in America, or some other country, hoping to
find that elusive security guarantee.
<p>
Although America needs her fast-declining resources for her own
citizens, she takes in these refugees because she is afraid not
to; she must save face.  And what president would risk losing
votes because he refused to let oppressed people into this land
of once golden opportunity?  After all, hasn't America been
noted for taking in both aliens and refugees:
<p>
<blockquote>``Give me your tired, your  poor,<br>
Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,<br>
The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.<br>
Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,<br>
I lift my lamp beside the golden door!''<br>
</blockquote>
<p>
There was a time when these immigrants were needed in the work
force.  They provided cheap labor, but no longer are there
enough jobs to offer, not even to our own citizens.  Is our
vaunted Statue of Liberty at the entrance to New York Bay
becoming a travesty of all it once stood for?  How about taking
care of our own "homeless, tempest-tost"!
<p>
And how did the gunman who recently shot and killed a member of
the CIA in Washington, D.C. qualify as a political asylum
applicant?  And nobody knows how the World Trade Center suspect
and his spiritual leader slipped throughcustoms illegally.  Our
own brands of terrorism carried out in foreign lands because of
our fear of running out of oil seems to have brought foreign
terrorism home where we can see the devastation first hand.  Now
we really have something to be afraid of.
<p>
Overpopulation is one of the most touchy and serious problems
facing America today--in fact facing the world--, and an influx
of aliens and refugees only adds to this tense situation.
Putting welfare people to work at minimum wage instead of
providing them with income security is an insult to their
sensibilities.  How can most families live on minimum wage?  As
one fellow, who had been busted for dealing in drugs, so
succinctly put it: "Why should I work at McDonald's for minimum
wage when I can make $1000 or more a night dealing in drugs?"
Does this system deserve the criminals it creates?  And are
these criminals any more criminal than a social system that pays
its politicians well, partly with tax dollars from the working
poor, while most of its citizens live in fear of winding up with
no security at all?
<p>
Out of this fear, America has become an armed camp with more
homicides each year than any other industrialized country.
Years ago people were fortunate if they lived to a ripe old age
with their health intact.  Now they are lucky if they live to a
ripe old age without getting shot.
<p>
Schools are installing metal detectors,  not just high schools,
but elementary schools as well.  In some areas teachers take
their lives in their hands merely by practicing their
profession.  They are afraid they will be shot by a student who
is afraid he will fail, or for some other reason just as simple.
Or one student may shoot another student over a silly
misunderstanding or jealousy or fear of peer pressure.
<p>
Suicides strike all ages.  The elderly take their lives because
they are afraid to live to the end, afraid of being mugged,
afraid of losing their life's savings to insecure times or to
the insatiable financial appetite of themedical profession.
Joblessness often creates severe mental depression that some ex-
workers cannot cope with.  Many young people feel they can no
longer tolerate a society that does not provide a future for
them.    Fear controls the masses.  Fear of an unforgiving God.
Fear of losing property.  Fear of not enough to eat.  Fear of
increased taxes.  Fear of an invasion by foreign enemies, a
scare trumped up by politicians and the military to keep their
war games going because they fear losing their lucrative profit
or their control of foreign oil.
<p>
Crime is a byproduct of fear.  Supposedly decent persons will
lie to an insurance company over a car accident, or falsely
testify or even produce a false witness because they are afraid
their rates will go up.  And insurance companies are afraid that
pursuing cheaters over small sums will be more expensive that
just paying them off, which hurts the innocent.  Fear creates a
cycle of mistrust in which no one is immune from suspicion.
<p>
Thousands of American citizens have come to fear doctors and
hospitals which leaves medical and pharmaceutical companies
running scared.  Demand for their services has declined as
people seek relief with vitamins and natural healing
alternatives  So now there is a legislative bill waiting to be
signed to force citizens to purchase their vitamins from
pharmacies. The humanitarianreason?  It is feared these citizens
won't take the correct amount of vitamins and may injure their
health.
<p>
One of the biggest and most comprehensive investigations of
medical malpractice ever undertaken by a team of doctors,
lawyers and analysts (at Harvard University) concluded that
150,000 Americans are killed annually by medicaltreatment with
more than half of those deaths due to negligence.  "Medical
injury accounts for more than all other types of accidents
combined and dwarfs the mortality rates associated with motor
vehicle accidents (50,000 per year) and occupation-related
mishaps (6,000 per year)," the researchers said (Newhouse News
Service, May, 1993).  No wonder American citizens are beginning
to fear their doctors and their prescription-administered drugs.
<p>
Most news media sources, except radical and underground
publications, must dish out what their sponsors want or chance
losing their advertising, which helps keep them afloat.  So this
fear of the truth breeds more distrust as that rational part of
the public, those who take time out to think occasionally,
begins to realize they are being misled daily by their daily
news media.
<p>
Timber companies have clear-cut themselves and their workers out
of jobs in their fear of soon being cut off from taking too much
timber.  Everyone likes to eat; it is alleged that some forest
fires are started by arsonists tokeep fire fighters in business
and to give salvage jobs to timber companies, which in turn has
created a new surge in the "water wagon" enterprise.
<p>
"During the lightening-induced fires of 1987, there weren't
enough water trucks in Trinity County.  So all of a sudden 40 or
50 men took out big loans and got themselves water tenders
costing anywhere from $15,000 to $40,000.  The trucks sit idle
most of the time.  But during last summer's Barker and Fountain
fires, the state paid $1,375 a day per truck and two drivers.
The president of the Hayfork Chamber of Commerce, a millworker,
said that hegrossed $14,695 in eight days on the Barker Fire.
In all likelihood, a lot of truck owners paid off heavy loans
around that time.  The extensive research for cause by the
California Department of Forestry and Fires Prevention concluded
that not only was the Barker fire arson, but also it had been
set to create employment in recession-hit Hayfork, California."
(Mike Weiss, writing for Mother Jones magazine, Mar/Apr issue,
1993.)
<p>
Who starts these fires?  Of course no one will own up to them.
What is amazing is that seldom are these arsonists caught, which
makes one wonder just how far-reaching the jobs go that are
created by starting fires.
<p>
And not the least of our fears is the fear we must face while
living in our own homes or walking on the sidewalk, not just at
night but in broad daylight also.  There was a time when we
didn't  always lock our doors.  Not any more.  Some residents
whose houses are located in once respectable, safe neighborhoods
now bar both their windows and doors and install burglar alarms
as well.
<p>
We practice caution when we answer our phones so no one will
know we are home alone.  We make sure that our answering-service
message makes it appear that we are home but just can't come to
the phone right now.  Our children are in danger of being
kidnapped or violated, a fear that is on our minds the minute we
let them out the door and remains with us until they return.
<p>
The late newspaper columnist, Sydney Harris, once wrote: "Crime
starts at the top and filters on down through the masses."  The
Mafia is alleged to have got its start when the people reached
their limit of tolerance after being oppressed by a system that
treated them like serfs.
<p>
Entire civilizations have disappeared when the wealth became
concentrated in the hands of a few and the military grew too
powerful.  According to Dr. R. E. Search, less than two percent
of the people control ninety percent of the wealth of America
today.  (His views on the strength of our military are not
available, but we can judge that for ourselves.)
<p>
If we would scrap the price tag on all goods and services and
balance our production and distribution with energy accounting,
a system of measurement that would utilize our resources for the
benefit of all, a sense of security could replace most fears
practically overnight.  Why hasn't such a system been installed
before this when its design has been available for over 60
years?  Because those at thetop fear losing their power.  Others
fear that with a balanced work load to offset the new slaves
(machines), which such a system would require, some wouldn't
carry their fair share.  And what about our cars?  There
wouldn't be a problem with losing them to theft any more,  but
then we might not be able to drive the flashiest on the block,
never mind it would be the most energy efficient.  And would we
have as nice a house as our neighbor?  And what if we lost our
diversity in culture.  Oh the fear of it all.
<p>
According to Franklin Delanor Roosevelt, "We have nothing to
fear but fear itself."  Maybe so, but tunnel vision is a pretty
fearsome affliction and what is even more scary, it is catching.
