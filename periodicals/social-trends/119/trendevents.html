The downsizing and the lean and mean look is taking its toll
among the once permanent white-collar workers.  Drake Beam
Morin, who recently released a study of the trend, predicts that
3.1 million white-collar employees will get the pink slip this
year, more than the 3 million last year, the 2.6 million in 1991
or the 2.2 million in 1990.
<p>
According to studies by Harvard University professor, James L.
Medoff, those white-collar workers who are fortunate in finding
another job after being terminated will, for the most part, wind
up making less money than before.
<p>
Even the brightest in college will have a hard time being hired
during this economic transformation.  "More and more people are
realizing they are going to have to fend for themselves",
statedDavid Speights, editor of a Silver Springs, MD newsletter
called <strong>American Marketplace</strong>.
<p>
It has become a fact of life that there is no such thing as job
security or permanency under the present economic system;
boosting profits is the name of the game and the people have
always been pawns to be moved around in the process.  This
nation with its present resources and industrial capacity,
provided it eliminates its parasitic pursuits and super
financial structure, could substantially reduce the hours a
person has to work and at the same time provide a high quality
standard of living for every American. Basing purchasing power
on the man-hours a person works or a jobs per se in this
technological age has become an anachronism.
