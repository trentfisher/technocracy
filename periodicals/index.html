<h1>Technocracy Periodicals</h1>
<p>

This is a list of all the magazines published by Technocracy
throughout its history, and a list of the currently published
<a href="#newsletters">Newsletters</a>.
I don't have all of these magazines, so I
have had to infer many dates from other magazines of the
period. Please send me any corrections or updates.
<p>
I have a number of articles from (and many compleat issues of) various
magazines available by following the various links.
However, even the compleat issues I have are not quite the same as the
printed magazines:  reprinted articles, some illustrations, filler
bits, &amp;c. are not present.
Consider subscribing and buying the printed back-issues.
