The "School-Choice/Voucher" issue keeps appearing on ballots all over
the United States. In many places, it has been defeated more than
once, and still it reappears, gathering adherents to the point that it
may well pass where it failed before. In some instances, Black and
Hispanic parents provide growing support for what started as strictly
a right wing move to get more children out of the public educational
system. An article titled "School-Choice Allies," p. A-3, (December
27, 1997), San Francisco Chronicle  quotes Janie Perry, administrator
at Watch-Care Academy, an all black private school in Denver, as
saying, "Minority children are the ones doing the worst in public
schools." The article cited figures from a recent Denver study of
reading proficiency; the study showed whites to have a 58%, and black
and hispanics only a 24% proficiency rate. On the whole, the
environment of the Whites is "richer" and the environment of Blacks
and Hispanics is "Poorer."
<p>
I would argue that minority students are doing "the worst" in public
schools because many come from low income neighborhoods, homes with
lots of financial problems, and got a slow start on their educations.
And, yes, public schools compound this failure with cramped and
ill-supplied institutions staffed by overworked and demoralized
people.
Some are better than others. Some are worse. Still, one would be
pressed not to agree that by equalizing the environment of the two
groups, the disparity noted above would lessen.
<p>
The public schools, in general, set a base line for what is accepted
or tolerated as "education." Parents assuage their guilt and blur
their sense of reality by hustling to get their children into
"alternative public schools" and/or private schools. I contend that
even "good" private schools are only good relative to this base line.
They may have many more books, more computers, smaller classes,
teachers with higher degrees and more pluck. Then, again, they may
have very little more and, on the down side, segregate children from a
wide variety of people and experiences, thus stultifying the
children's educational development. Even the most elite private
school, where you can be sure these poor minority students will never
get in, shelter their students in peculiar and unhealthy ways. (Nature
opts for diversity, when possible. It is the route to a healthy
population).
<p>
Half of the children in California, to use one State as an example,
live in low income or poverty level households. ("State's Success
Failing to Reach Half of the Kids," San Francisco Chronicle, Nov. 5,
1997. Most of these underprivileged children are less prepared for
everything that happens to them than are the wealthier children. I can
understand why many in the wealthier half would shun these children.
They slow things down, a lot. Sending them to private schools with
vouchers in hand is a cruel hoax. (Granted children are in bad shape;
they've got whole other sets of problems, often connected to
over-privilege.) And what of the children who would be left behind in
the increasingly bereft public school system? Will we call it another arm
of the penal system, and just "keep them off the streets", for the
time being, anyway?
<p>
Our public schools ought to be, and could be, so good that no one
would even think of sending a child elsewhere. Rather than gutting our
public schools, we need to dramatically improve them. There are many
factions vying with one another to determine how to improve our
schools, or pointing out why we shouldn't bother. There already exist
many valid theories about how to teach, how to help students who start
out behind others, how to reach those with special problems, and on
and on. Money is thrown around here and there, but not over this way
or that. It doesn't really matter where the money is thrown. Students
need so much more care and attention than they are getting in any of
these systems, public or private. To say, as many who hope to profit
from the voucher system do, "We can do better than the Public
schools." isn't to say much.
<p>
If we want healthy, productive children -- tomorrow's citizens -- we
need much better means of making them that way. This includes an
enriched environment in and outside of school. Starting at birth,
wouldn't be too soon, either. Only a society very different from our
own can provide such an environment. Currently, we have a society in
which the rich are getting richer, and the poor are getting poorer.
Forget a wonderful environment for all children in this society; many
don't even get health care.
<p>
The voucher system is a tiny glitch one way or the other. With
vouchers, we would still have a dysfunctional, piecemeal educational
system. It would make a cosmetic change, but would compound the actual
failure of our public schools. That will solve nothing. We need an
entirely new environment.
<p>
Technocracy Inc., a scientific, educational research organization,
proposes a mammoth change that would bring society into a new
environment. In this new social structure, called "The Technological
Social Design," the educational system would be entirely revamped.
Those concerned and involved would be well advised to study
Technocracy's concepts and decide if the organization has a valid
solution to our perplexing education problems. Ample literature is
available. There are numerous articles outlining how the North
American Continent could be organized. I won't go into that aspect
here. First we have to admit just how bad things are; then, we can
focus on what to do about it. Once accomplished, we can benefit from
the skills and talents of all children because we will educate them as
the unique and valuable individuals they are.
