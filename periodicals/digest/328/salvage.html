<h3>Life Extension For A Bankrupt System</h3>
<p>
Whatever happened to that long-awaited crash, that new depression,
that widely-feared economic crisis? It was not just anticipated by
gloomsters and pessimists, or by reformers and futurists looking for a
new deal. It was accepted as the inevitable outcome of a period of
vigorous growth which could not continue. Indeed, it seemed to be
happening in the early eighties when inflation reached double digits
-- nearly 20% -- in the U.S. Instead, North American economies resumed
steady growth. The Price System had been salvaged.
<p>
<h3>How?</h3>
<p>
Call it innovative bookkeeping, creative financing, or what you will.
The rules were changed in unprecedented ways -- ways seldom defined,
little noticed, but drastic and fundamental, as we will discuss. Most
importantly, the changes were temporary measures which cannot be
repeated or sustained. The great crisis had been deferred, but not for
good. Here, now, we will discuss some of the novel devices being
invoked to salvage a moribund Price System. First, it is necessary to
understand the usual life cycle of a Price System.
<p>
<h3>The Rise And Fall Of Price Systems</h3>
<p>
Briefly, modern economies grow by the creation of debt -- corporate,
private, and governmental. And debt grows by the prevailing interest
rate. This accumulating debt rests upon physical growth of the
economy. As long as there is sound physical growth, interest can be
earned and paid on the growing debt structure. The interest
`validates' the integrity -- the value -- of debt. If growth lags, or
ends, new debt cannot be created, and old debt withers as interest
rates decline or default. It is an oft repeated recipe for an economic
crisis.
<p>
The process is described here in terms of debt. But a debt is the
lender's term, corresponding to a credit to the borrower. The process
can be described as readily in terms of credit. In either case, it is
the banks and other financial institutions that are the main players
and the best indicators of the total action.
<p>
History is littered with collapsed debt structures and with the
economic chaos that results. (Now, in late 1997, Asia is presenting a
cluster of examples; before that it was Mexico; and before that some
countries in South America, and now Russia, all of recent date.) Some
are worse than others. Sometimes foreign intervention modifies the
result. In the worst cases, resort to unlimited inflation ends in
worthless money, a new currency is substituted for the old currency,
and a new growth cycle begins. Somewhat less severe, the great
Depression of the 1930's was not countered with inflation, but rather
with deflation. Debt was massively defaulted, and the money supply
dried up. World War II started a new cycle of debt creation, ending
the Great Depression.
<p>
The period of reconstruction and new growth following WW II survived a
series of minor recessions until the late `70s and early `80s, when a
very serious threat of economic collapse threatened. But it did not
happen. The problems were overcome. How?
<p>
<h3>Innovative Banking</h3>
<p>
Possibly the most outstanding example of this manoeuvre can be found
in the deregulated Savings and Loans institutions of the United
States. Freed to speculate in real estate, this ended up in multi-
billion dollar bankruptcies of the S and L banks, which were then
partially settled with `sucker' (read: taxpayer) money.
<p>
Bankruptcy was traditionally a shameful end of unsuccessful or
fraudulent enterprises. Not anymore. In the desperate search for
places to invest surplus funds, banks and other money sources
recklessly underwrite ventures of all kinds. Generous write-off terms,
by law, indemnify the banks from the predictable harvest of tens of
thousands of bankruptcies, great and small. Who pays? However
indirectly, it is John Q. Public, suckered again.
<p>
<h3>Managed Inflation</h3>
<p>
In the past, inflation was the last resort of bankrupt economies.
Economies, that is, where the debt structure exceeded the productive
capacity of the economy and/or the purchasing power needed to sustain
it. A temporary solution was to support purchasing power by printing
money or expanding credit with no corresponding increase in productive
capacity. The result was inflation of prices, the printing of more
money, more inflation, higher prices, and so on until the currency
approached worthlessness and was replaced with a new currency at, say,
one new to ten old. In short, inflation was a case of too much money
chasing too few goods.
<p>
In America, the situation was different. Here the productive capacity
seemed almost without limit. Modest inflation was tolerable and
productive capacity quickly adapted. Monetary or credit expansion of
around two or three percent became the norm. So growth of the economy
and of the debt structure moved forward to salvage the Price System
once more. However inflation of any amount penalizes those on fixed
incomes. These include those on `un-indexed' wages, salaries, and
pensions, as well as holders of fixed income investments. So add these
to our list of `suckers' caught in the salvage procedures.
<p>
<h3>Globalism And Foreign Trade</h3>
<p>
The term and the concept of `globalism' have been sold to the public
on a massive scale and so successfully that the idea is now commonly
accepted as inevitable. It appears to be a new dimension of foreign
trade. Trade barriers are being dismantled as never before. The credit
which facilitates these transactions provides a new growth of the debt
structure -- a new, and for the time being, a profitable assignment of
surplus funds for investment. The Price System is salvaged again! This
exploitation of foreign trade is not new in kind, just in dimension.
Under the guise of `globalism', it is essentially an extension of
foreign investment. It is a temporary measure which can, and often
does, collapse in failure when markets cannot absorb the increase in
productivity.
<p>
<h3>Privatization</h3>
<p>
Many functions that were formerly government responsibilities have
been `privatized'; that is, handed over to the private sector. Major
airports are an example. This has provided an opportunity for private
investment and a further growth of that share of the debt structure.
The government, at the same time, has been relieved of incurring debt
or levying taxes to accomplish the same objectives. It was a
convenient arrangement for governments already overburdened by debt
and at the limit of the tax resource.
<p>
<h3>The Charity Game</h3>
<p>
Better evidence of the failure of the economy (the Price System) and
of governance could hardly be found than the proliferation of
charities and other fund raising schemes. There are tens of thousands
of them, preying on the gullibility and soft-heartedness of the middle
class. Such a massive con game could only be perpetrated by systematic
brain-washing of the public by all the institutions involved: the
government, the media, the churches, and supported by business,
industry, financial institutions, community organizations: in short,
it is intrinsic to the status quo. All this in an economy of potential
abundance!
<p>
Food banks have been around for over fifteen years, and are still
growing. A myriad of other relief organizations minister to a growing
sub-class of citizenry. The fund-raising drives in support of these
efforts have turned into a small industry, highly organized and
efficiently aggressive. Hospitals beg for funds to support new
equipment and treatments. Educational institutions beg for support for
libraries, equipment, tuition, and to stem the erosion of their
capabilities as educational institutions. Societies beg on behalf of
wild life, endangered species, anti-pollution, flood, fire and famine
victims -- the list goes on.
<p>
All this is testimony to the abject failure of the contemporary
economic system, and the governance that allows it to continue. It is
a massive cover-up, allowing business and government to avoid due
responsibility for the society that sustains them. It is an important
prop in sustaining and salvaging the Price System for a while longer.
<p>
<h3>Volunteerism</h3>
<p>
Complementing the legion of charity functions is an army of
volunteers, picking up the deficiencies of a derelict government and a
failing economy. There is nothing new in the nature of volunteerism;
just in its extent. It has been elevated to the status of a pillar of
society. Indeed, economist Jeremy Rifkin classifies it as an equal
partner with the government and private sectors. Equal in importance,
that is, but not equal in reward and status. So it is that the economy
depends on a sub-class of citizen workers to sustain the game of the
Price System. With moral suasion and meagre rewards, the volunteer
army carries on as a successful salvage operation for the Price
System. For how long?
<p>
<h3>Et Al.</h3>
<p>
"And others." There is a myriad of other schemes and promotions to
create new debt and to reward the debt holders. Some are large-scale
and obvious, such as the trend into crafts, and ventures into cottage
industries; others are small and obscure such as the market play on
"derivatives". Many fail and join the bankruptcy parade. But the game
goes on as long as majority debt-claim holders hold a winning hand.
The uncertainty of that position has led to the many manuvres to
salvage the Price System.
<p>
<h3>The Multilateral Agreement On Investment  (MAI)</h3>
<p>
Waiting in the wings, as of this date, is something of a trump card,
which may be played in a desperate and ultimate effort to salvage the
Price System. If enacted, this international treaty will give
unbridled scope to new debt creation without the hinderance of
national borders, sovereign rights, labor rights, environmental
considerations, resource utilization, or any other responsibility
toward an exploited nation. Undoubtedly, dimensions of personal
liberty would be sacrificed in the process. It is unbridled
corporatism, and might be better labelled global fascism. Although
conceived in secrecy, it is now coming into the open and may yet be
defeated, if a concerned and aroused public rally in time.
<p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
Howard Scott identified the issue: "In the passing of the old and the
institution of the new, human conflict will become the bitterest in
history. Science is hated and feared by ecclesiastical
institutionalism, by corporate enterprise, and political parties. The
fear and hatred that will be directed by these, against science and
technological application, will be far greater than those the
Inquisition hurled against all the accumulated heresies. Only science
and its technological application to the means whereby we live can
produce for mankind the control of his (her) social destiny here on
this earth."
<p>
Those same institutions are not above using the tools that technology
provides as means to further their agendas: that is, to sustain the
Price System; to maintain the rewards for debt claim holders; to
prevent the distribution of national wealth as a right of citizenship;
in short, to maintain the status quo.
<p>
The threatened imposition of the MAI would be the equivalent of a new
Dark Age, in which the bottom lines of global corporations would be
the only criteria for social decisions.
<p>
Resist! And join the action!
