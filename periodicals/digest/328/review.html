<p>
There has been a quiet depression developing since 1990. There is a
booming stock market in the midst of rocketing executive compensation,
while real wages continue to slide. The grinding poverty that co-
exists with unprecedented opulence in America, today, is creating a
climate of distrust and anger.
<p>
A brief study of most advanced economies -- G7, Spain, and Australia
-- reveals that the quiet depression of the 1990s has been a global
phenomenon.
<p>
Manufacturing employment peaked in 1979, at a little over 21 million
people. Ever since then, the new entrants in the job market have gone,
primarily, to service-producing industries. In 1995, manufacturing
employment stood at 18 million -- about 15 percent of the total
non-farm employment. Before the 1980s, most lay-offs were among blue
collar workers. During the '80s, with waves of downsizing, white
collar workers were the main victims. From 1990-1995, some three
million corporate lay-offs occurred. During this time period,
corporate after-tax profits rose 70 percent in the five years, from
$229 billion to $390 billion.
<p>
During the 1930s, real wages in the U.S. rose by 17 percent. From 1990
to 1995, real family income has dropped six percent.
<p>
U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics show that from 1972 to 1995, for the
lowest-paid 75 percent of the workforce, after-tax inflation-adjusted
income fell by 25 percent. Real wages have been tumbling for 80
percent of the workforce since 1972.
<p>
U.S. Top-Bracket Income Tax Rate:
<ul>
  <li>1960-1963 was 91 percent
  <li>1965-1980 was 70 percent
  <li>1985 was 50 percent
  <li>1988 was 28 percent
  <li>1990 was 31 percent
  <li>1993-1995 was and is 39.6 percent
</ul>
<p>
The culprit for growth stagnation in the 1980s, was the massive
transfer of the tax burden from the rich to the poor. Payroll taxes
soared, and the top-bracket income tax rate tumbled. The switch to
regressive taxation was accompanied by the lowest post-World War II
rate of investment.
<p>
There is absolutely no historical backing for the supply-side idea
that low income taxes stimulate personal savings. Further, low taxes
on the rich do not stimulate investment. The greatest tax impact on
investment, savings, and the economy, is the S.S., or Social Security
Tax. Drastically raising the S.S. tax has had a dramatic effect on
lower income workers. By 1993, the Social Security tax was 37 percent
of the total tax receipts. The American tax structure thus became
ultra-regressive.
<p>
Historically, the corporate income tax has had no visible effect on
the investment/GDP ratio. The long history of capital formation shows
that the business rate of investment has barely fluctuated since the
Second World War ended, 50 years ago. It is then clear that all the
tax breaks handed out to corporations since 1950 have been a colossal
waste. Multinational business did not return a penny in increased
investment as a percent of GDP, even as it extracted billions from the
U.S. Treasury in tax breaks. None of these discoveries has stopped
conservative economists and politicians from pleading for even more
corporate tax breaks. The corporate share of tax revenue exceeded 25
percent in the 1950s. By 1985, after the Reagan tax cuts, it was down
by two-thirds. In 1995, it barely exceeded 10 percent.
<p>
Conservative economists and politicians argue for big capital gains
tax cuts. The stock market has been soaring since August 1982, with
huge paper profits for major shareholders who have earned billions of
dollars. They would like to hang on to their windfalls as they cash
in.
<p>
The investment lesson of history is that investment is linked to
demand, not to tax breaks for millionaires, corporations, and venture
capitalists. Since the rich spend a much smaller proportion of their
income for consumption than do the poor, consumer spending and, hence,
demand, generally fail to grow as fast as output. Because of rising
inequality, demand lags supply. Output, then, has to fall to the level
of demand, and growth slows down.
<p>
History is full of irony. Republicans constantly rail against
deficits; yet their leaders have been most responsible for the
country's red ink. In Reagan's first term, alone, the federal debt
exceeded the combined debt of all previous 39 presidents. In 1980, the
federal debt was less than One Trillion Dollars. By the end of
Reagan's second term, in 1988, it stood at $2.6 Trillion. By the start
of 1996, it approximated $5 Trillion.
<p>
By 1995, the United States had the worst inequality among all advanced
economies, including Australia. The lowest 20 percent consumed only
3.6 percent of national income; the top fifth enjoyed nearly half of
the income pie.
<p>
The top one percent of the population now owns more than 40 percent of
assets, compared to owning 21 percent in 1949. The average pay of the
chief executives of the Fortune 500 companies jumped from 35 times to
157 times the salary of the average non-supervisory worker. In 1995,
less than 40 percent of employees enjoyed corporate pension benefits.
<p>
Germany, and other countries in Europe, are quite often described, in
a derogatory way, as welfare states which care for the poor, the
unemployed, the handicapped, and the retirees, among others. The
inference is that the rich are financing a huge pyramid of social
welfare that will eventually undermine the economy. This is completely
misleading. The corporate tax burden in Germany has been extremely low
-- always below 10 percent, and only four percent since 1992. The
welfare state is mostly financed by the middle class.
<p>
Conventional economics almost totally neglects the impact of wealth
disparity on the health of an economy. Despite their extensive
theories and vast computer models, economists have lately had a dismal
forecasting record. Queer ideas have been always present in economies,
but today, with its enormous emphasis on mathematical models, the
so-called "dismal science" has queer ideas in abundance. Economics,
now totally divorced from common sense, is causing untold suffering that
will continue until its obnoxious theories are exposed to the public
and put to shame.
<p>
Throughout history, intellectuals, as a class, have been the last to
adopt new ideas.
<p>
What has rising trade between the U.S.A. and Mexico done to Mexican
wages? From 1985 to 1988, real wages in Mexico fell six percent. They
fell another 25 percent by 1995. The gap between their wages went up
sharply. In just two years after the inauguration of NAFTA in January,
1994, the Mexican economy collapsed. The Mexicans went on a buying
spree, leading to a huge trade deficit of $30 billion. In December,
1994, the peso collapsed.
<p>
<p>
COMMENTARY:
<p>
In his introduction to his book, the author writes:
<p>
"America, What is Wrong? Americans have a nagging feeling, today, that
something is wrong with their economy and society. They have been
groping for answers since the beginning of the 1990s; but, in the
absence of rational explanations, they are very confused. They have
repeatedly thrown incumbents out of office, to express their anger and
frustration; but the pall of gloom continues to thicken. The new
leaders have no better answers than the old.
<p>
"....Our economy is very sick today. Its sickness is new; nothing of
this kind has been seen in the past. It needs a fresh diagnosis and
prescription. Old cures are not working and will not work, no matter
how often they are re-named and re-introduced. The purpose of this
book is to examine America's economic ills and offer new but effective
medicine. We need to overhaul the system, not just tinker with it and
indulge in wishful thinking that the economy will heal itself."
<p>
Batra cites four vicious self-perpetuating circles as the troubles
global economies face today. The first two are taxation: 1. Taxing the
poor. 2. Taxing the rich. 3. Lower tariffs. 4. Debt, corruption,
interest burden, and growing suffering among the masses in developing
economies that came into contact with the multi-national banks. 
<p>
He writes that he has devised his global economic plan with great
care, and is sure we will see nothing but common sense in it; "It is
designed to bring prosperity to the world while minimizing pollution."
<p>
From our scientific viewpoint, Technocracy points out that nothing is
going to change on our Continent, or globally, with this author's
plan. You will note what he writes about overhauling the system; he,
of course, means the monetary system. He thinks that his economic plan
will rectify the social system.
<p>
As our Technocrat reviewer points out, when you review history, you
can see that no economic plan is going to change anything. Nothing but
a plan based on science using Energy Accounting will work.
