<h2>WHAT IS TECHNOCRACY?</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>
Spread out before all three groups (laborers, white-collar workers,
professionals) is the spectacle of a gutted continent, its resources
wasted and flung away in the crazy race for the profit that strangled
the system.
</blockquote>
<p>
These prophetic words were written in 1933, by the founder of
Technocracy, the late Howard Scott.
<p>
<h3>Technocrats are asked this so often: "What is Technocracy?" And, by
the way, "What are Technocrats?"</h3>
<p>
Briefly, Technocracy is the method of science applied to the social
order. What that means is that this Technocratic method should have
been used to control the application of technology for the betterment
of society as a whole. What we have, now, in North America is a
political and monetary system (we labelled it a Price System) which
has destroyed the social order. That means that the social system
under which we now live is affected by money, strangled by money, and
deteriorated by money.
<p>
Technocracy discovered, through its scientific research, that money is
an interference in that social system. This was the conclusion reached
after 14 years of research by an organization known as the Technical
Alliance, the forerunner of the organization of Technocracy. The
primary aim of this research was to ascertain the possibility of
applying the achievements of science to social and industrial affairs
-- for the benefit of all citizens.
<p>
Howard Scott, a young engineer-scientist-technologist, had friends and
acquaintances in a very select group of people who, like himself, were
the top experts in one field or other; but Howard Scott's thinking
went further -- to a consideration of the workings of the entire
social system. His views were of interest to the people listed below
who formed the Technical Alliance in 1918, for the purpose of
undertaking an energy survey of North America. The work went on for 14
years under the leadership of Howard Scott, whom they elected to serve
as Chief Engineer of the Technical Alliance. These names are still
recognized as the top innovators who developed many of the
technological and scientific devices that we use today. Full details
of their accomplishments can be found in any good encyclopedia.

When it was incorporated as Technocracy Inc., its members became known
as Technocrats.
<p>
One of our magazine issues, February 1974, which Technocracy Digest
entitled Questions and Answers, answered questions most often asked
about Technocracy. Now, 24 years later, in this issue, we try to bring
to the reader answers to the problems brought to the forefront by this
more complicated technological era. The questions and answers will
point out why and how we have these problems, why they have become
complicated, when there was no need of them becoming so, and what can
be done to remedy them.
<p>
For instance, in this present Price System, if we go to build a
hospital with the very latest medical equipment, what is it that
determines its size, its equipment, its availability to the public?
Money is the determinant! If the community purse is not large, or
served by the wrong political party, that determines the type of
hospital it can afford. No matter if the community's population is
growing, or if they need specialized equipment to meet the new medical
research, they cannot build what is really needed because they don't
have the money. They have the building materials, the expertise to
build the hospital, the expertise to operate the hospital, the most
modern medical machines available, but they may be able to afford only
the bare minimum because they don't have the money. Isn't that
ridiculous? The only thing in the way is money -- those little bits of
paper.
<p>
And that about sums up what we would like the reader to keep in mind:
We don't need MONEY. The only thing keeping us from enjoying the
benefits of our wonderful technology is the interference of money.
<p>
Oh, and, also, the apathy of people who won't join us to demand that a
new social system be put in place of MONEY.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>GETTING PEOPLE TO THINK</h2>
<p>
<h3>Why haven't you been able to get people to think along the lines of
Technocracy?</h3>
<p>
For one thing, the only information about Technocracy getting out to
the public has come from the lectures and literature of this
organization. We were "buried" in the late '30s, when the financial
structure became worried that people were going to adopt the social
system that we outlined for them.
<p>
During the Depression of the '30s, we had the fastest growing
organization on this Continent. Nearly every little hamlet, town, and
city in North America had people who met in homes, groups, and
sections to learn about Technocracy. The newspapers all over the
country printed glowing reports about us. In our Technocracy Digest
No. 326, fourth quarter 1997, we re-reprinted one of those articles,
from Liberty, a popular magazine at the time.
<p>
Then, in the late '30s, we began to see disparaging articles about
Technocracy. Then they stopped printing anything about us. In 1939, of
course, World War II was forced on us. The penniless began to get jobs
and money jingling in their pockets, and all thought disappeared as
they prospered in their jobs or went off to war to be killed.
<p>
After that, the false prosperity, for awhile, lulled most people into
thinking that they "had it made" as they began to enjoy all the new
gadgets and technology. They were amused and misinformed by television
programs; so much so, that now, many of them don't know how to think
or what to think. They can see their troubles piling up, but they
don't know what to do about them.
<p>
In response to a Doug Todd column on spirituality, Vancouver Sun,
Saturday Review, Nov. 15/97, one letter-writer to its editor wrote,
"we need a deep thinker to help humanity "Grow up" and leave
superstition behind.
<p>
"Each generation has thinkers who try to make us less superstitious --
less primitive. For their efforts, some thinkers suffer the fate of
Socrates, Salman Rushdie, Ken Saro-Wiwa, and Madalyn O'Hair. Most
enter oblivion, unknown. Deep thinkers we have. What we need is a
brain that wants to listen to them rather than kill them."
<p>
He should have added to that list of thinkers, one more brilliant than
those he mentioned: the late Howard Scott, Director-in-Chief of this
organization of Technocracy, who, some time after saying these words
in 1933, suffered the fate of anonymity through a silenced press:
<p>
"Spread out before all three groups (laborers, white-collar workers,
professionals) is the spectacle of a gutted continent, its resources
wasted and flung away in the crazy race for the profit that strangled
the system."
<p>
The reason we extol Howard Scott is because he presented to the people
of North America a valid, scientific Design which would have prevented
the present `strangulation' of this social system. His words were not
just a prophesy. This was information gleaned from 14 years of
scientific research by the Technical Alliance, which proved that
unless the new technology was used for the betterment of everyone in
this society, we would inherit just what we are experiencing now: the
misuse of technology, which has brought down upon us: resources
wasted, poverty, environmental damage to air, soil and water. Since
Scott spoke those words in 1933, the "crazy race for profit" has dealt
us 63 more years of misuse, to gut and waste this Continent. It has
strangled our social system.
<p>
At this point, we wonder if anyone can breathe air into it to save it.
<p>
The only ones, that we know of, still manning the pumps are the
Technocrats.

<p>
<h2>HOW WOULD YOU VOTE IN A TECHNATE?</h2>
<p>
You have told us that our present political system would be
substituted by a Technate. Would you tell us how our leaders would be
selected?
<p>
Leaders would be selected in much the same way that industry now
selects its supervisory staff in the technical phases. (Note that we
stressed technical. Many industries now have CEOs who are financial
wizards but who would be lost if they were asked to perform any
physical technical task, or to give instructions to anyone else to do
the job. Accounting personnel would be needed, but only to record the
amount of energy needed for these particular functions. No one needed
to count money.)
<p>
This is called the vertical alignment method of promotion, and
involves recommendation from below on the basis of competence, and
appointment from above.
<p>
The basic unit of this organization is the Functional Sequence. A
Functional Sequence is one of the larger industrial or service units,
the various parts of which are related, one to the other, in a direct
functional sequence. Thus, among the major Industrial Sequences, for
instance, we have transportation, communication, agriculture, and the
major industrial units. Among the Service Sequences are education, and
health.
<p>
In the Technate, supervisory personnel would ascend through their
respective Functional Sequences on the basis of demonstrated
competence, reaching whatever plateaus of accomplishment their
abilities allowed.
<p>
The most competent would become Sequence Directors, and would
represent their Sequences on the Continental Control. There, they
would coordinate the work of all Sequences to achieve maximum
efficiency. Their chairperson would be the Continental Director,
elected by them to that position, because there would be no one higher
than the Director to appoint that person to the role.
<p>
These leaders would hold office, either until retirement at age 45, or
until replaced by someone else from within their Sequences, for
sufficient reason. People could be replaced, perhaps, for
incompetence, or illness, or because they wished to retire from this
position.
<p>
The Continental Director, elected by a two-thirds majority vote of the
Continental Control, would serve in that capacity until retirement,
unless earlier removed by the Board through a similar vote.

<h2>GOVERNMENT</h2>
<p>
What would become of political government under Technocracy?
<p>
It would cease to exist, having no vital relationship to the
fundamental processes of modern society; namely, the industrial
mechanism, and the rendering of necessary services.
<p>
Political government, however well-intentioned, is not competent to
administer the complexities of modern technology to best social
advantage; and moreover, its main reason for being is more to
perpetuate the interests of its financial (business) supporters than
to serve the needs of society as a whole. In other words, political
government is a tool for the maintenance of the Price System (monetary
system), and has no place in the functional governance of a
predominantly technological society.
<p>
Will Technocracy take political party action? Never!
<p>
If a majority of people can see that in order for their survival it is
mandatory there be a definite change to a new order, we suggest that
they demand it. This could be accomplished by giving approval for a
national, or even continental, referendum for the installation of a
Technate -- the Technocracy Technological Social System that has been
thoroughly researched, and that current events have proven, is still
correct.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>THE ENERGY CERTIFICATE</h2>
<p>
What does Technocracy propose to substitute for money?
<p>
An Energy Accounting System. Technocracy proposes to replace money, as
a medium of exchange, with the Energy card -- a non-fluctuating medium
of distribution.
<p>
Everything that is produced takes energy. It is an easy matter to
determine how much energy it takes to produce each product. This is
its true cost, and it would be expressed in a scientific term of
physical measurement as units of energy.
<p>
Money relationships are all based upon `value', which, in turn, is a
function of scarcity. You know: if it's scarce, the price goes up.
Hence, money is not a `measure' of anything. Also, money is negotiable
-- it can be traded, stolen, given or gambled away. Thirdly, money can
be saved. Fourthly, money circulates and is not destroyed or cancelled
out on being spent. It's absolutely not dependable.
<p>
The energy medium would eliminate these drawbacks and institute a
balanced system of production and distribution in an economy of
abundance.
<p>
Technocracy would use only ENERGY ACCOUNTING, which would provide a
continuous inventory of goods and services, so it would be known when
products needed to be replaced. It would give the widest latitude of
choice in consuming for everyone's individual share of the Continental
physical wealth.
<p>
After all, the purpose of a medium of distribution is to distribute.
This is all part of the Technocracy Technological Social Design: to
create a balance between production and distribution. Production
should not be more than the amount it distributes. Production should
be geared to the amount needed to distribute. Using this method would
do away with waste of vital natural resources. The Price System
method, of course, has wasted and pillaged our resources all across
the Continent, so that it is now not known how much we have left to
care for the constant growth of our population.
<p>
Technocracy proposes to substitute for the Price System:
<p>
First, a carefully planned production adjusted so as to maintain as
high a physical standard of living for the people of North America,
taking into account any limitation of non-replaceable natural
resources. Many of our resources have been wasted since this plan was
first devised, so every measure will be taken to conserve what we have
left.
<p>
Secondly, it proposes a carefully planned distribution, based upon the
total amount of energy consumed in production.
<p>
This plan for producing goods of optimal quality would give to each
individual a substantial income.
<p>
This would provide a balance between production and distribution so
that there would be no more waste.
<p>

<p>
<h2>WHO WOULD TAKE OUT THE GARBAGE?</h2>
<p>
Believe it or not, this is one of the most-asked questions we get.
<p>
The one asked the most is: What would you do with the people who
wouldn't work? But, that's another question -- we'll answer that
later.
<p>
This is a good question: Who would take out the garbage? And who would
do the jobs no one wants to do?  These questions came up one time at a
lecture given by one of our speakers, Ron Miller, of Portland,
speaking to a college class. Before he could answer the question, one
of the students, obviously a logical thinker, answered for him. She
said, "If it was a job nobody wanted to do, everybody would have to
take their turn."
<p>
Mr. Miller explained that "there will be problems in a society like
this, but there will be solutions for us."
<p>
Of course, there will. First of all, in our households, now, each of
us usually has some little chores which must be done, sometimes shared
by family members, as they have done for years. Each year, though, as
new refined technology is advanced, many mundane and distasteful jobs
will no longer exist. It will just be a matter of pushing the right
button -- for instance, to see all the garbage disappear.
<p>
And those jobs nobody wants to do, maybe somebody would love to do
them. Perhaps with the new tools available, those dirty jobs wouldn't
be too difficult. Here are a few examples: Some people like to work
outdoors and like mowing lawns and doing gardening. Or, another
example, without the cost to worry about, snow removal in colder areas
of the Continent would be done very quickly with fleets of machines --
that's "fleets" -- run by operators working in nice warm cabs.
<p>
Electrical and telephone lines would be all underground (as they
should be now) which would not entail workers to be in the freezing
cold trying to repair snapped lines. (As Canada witnessed what these
brave workers had to suffer with this winter's ice storms in Quebec
and Ontario, which left over one million of its citizens without heat,
water and lights for many weeks.)
<p>
Many new inventions would be there for those jobs no one likes to do,
and many of those new gadgets are there right now, if we could afford
them.
<p>
In a Technate, every able person would have to contribute four hours a
day, four days a week, for which they would be trained and competent
to do. In a Technate, schooling and training and being exposed to
types of jobs all over the Continent, would enable workers to pick out
a job for which they would be most suited, and would expose whether
they would have the ability for it. There would be no job market  --
only functions -- and you would not be doing a job because you had  to
in order to make a living.
<p>
At the time Technocracy's Technological Social Design was proposed, it
was stated that every individual's annual operating schedule would be
41 work periods, 4 days on, 3 days off -- 287 days (165 of which are
work days) plus 78 consecutive days of vacation. The first clean-up
stage might entail more hours; but, as time went on, adjustments would
be made as more technology released more workers.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
What is a Price System?
<p>
Any social system whatsoever that effects its distribution of goods
and services by means of a system of trade or commerce based on
commodity valuation and employing any form of debt tokens, or money,
constitutes a Price System.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>WELFARE</h2>
<p>
What would you do with the people who don't want to work?
<p>
And here is the most-asked question we get.
<p>
This surely seems to bother a lot of people. Many seem to begrudge
those who are getting welfare. They accuse them, without any evidence,
of not wanting to work.
<p>
People do not ordinarily refuse performing work they like doing, and
for the performance of which they have received specialized training;
unless, as so often happens in the Price System, artificial
obstructions have been introduced. As these would be totally absent in
a Technate, any refusal to perform functional service would initially
be treated as a medical problem. There would be a discussion about it
to find out if there was any logical reason for this refusal to do
their share to help their fellow-beings. If a medical examination
uncovered either a physical or mental reason for non-participation,
the subjects would be excused from function for as long as necessary,
without any loss of consuming power.
<p>
On the other hand, if no medical reason for non-participation in
performing some needed tasks were discovered, and these individuals
still did not understand why everyone should do their part to help
society, they would become the objects of rather severe social
disapprobation from their fellow citizens, until such time as they
decided to cease being public parasites. Actually, it is not expected
that enough such instances will occur to be of any social
significance.
<p>
In a Technate, there would be a great change in attitude when people
did not have to worry about their survival, or being stuck in jobs
leading nowhere.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>SECURITY</h2>
<p>
How "secure" would we be in a Technate?  Secure from what?
<p>
The social implications of Technocracy would be many. Take, for
instance, the attainment of leisure. For the first time in history,
man would be released from drudgery, and his creative energies set
free.
<p>
Technocracy would abolish all litigation, as at present understood in
the meaning of that term in our existing legal system. It would be
impossible in a Technate to sue for breach of promise, alimony, breach
of contract, damages, or to probate a will.
<p>
As practically all crime in the Price System results from the attempts
of individuals to acquire the property of others, illegally, to
alleviate their own insecurity, crime would practically cease to exist
in a Technocratic society. Technocracy defines a criminal to be a
human being with predatory instincts, living under a Price System,
without sufficient capital to start a corporation.
<p>
(Crimes where death results would, of course, be treated in a
different manner. Even these criminal acts are largely as a result of
Price System negligence, and if proper steps were taken before these
people reached this stage, these types of crime would also be non-
existent in a Technate.)
<p>
In a Technate, human beings would be treated, for the first time in
social history, not as willful entities, subject to legalistic
prohibitions, restraints and penalisations, but as energy-consuming
devices whose capacities as producers and consumers necessitate the
development of the highest state of both capacities in order that
human beings may be conditioned to living in a world of plenty where
one person's advantage over another person will no longer be socially
profitable.
<p>
<p>
All worthy social projects are implied in the one big objective of
Technocracy, which is to give to every human being adequate security.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>CHARITY</h2>
<p>
What would happen in a Technate to all the charitable organizations
which help the poor?
<p>
What charitable organizations? What poor? In a Technate there would be
no charitable organizations; nor poor, if you are thinking in the
context of doling out money to them.
<p>
There would be people who are poor in health. The organization that
would help them would be in the Health Sequence.
<p>
In a Technocracy  Digest, 2nd quarter 1992, we printed an article by
Dr. Thomas E. Carver, entitled CHARITY. Here are a few excerpts from
that article -- written in 1934.
<p>
"It is said that "Charity Begins At Home", and like many other old
saws founded in the "dark ages" and perfectly fitting and appropriate
a few hundred years ago, it should now be relegated to the age that
begat them, and forgotten.
<p>
Like the Production Age in which we are living today, and which is
universal in its application, charity to be Charity, must be universal
and not local.
<p>
The danger of localising Charity and the founding of an organization
for distribution purposes, is very much like setting up machinery to
irritate a condition to make it incurable, so that the machinery set
up for this specific purpose shall continue to be used for that
purpose and for that purpose only.
<p>
It must be admitted that Charity, by becoming organized, has
dissipated the purity of its original intentions in that they have
become lost in the organization. As the most casual observer will
inform us, the retention of this branch of social service, also
founded during the dark ages, instead of curing a disease, is actually
making it an incurable condition, for which they are largely
responsible, and actually foster.
<p>
In an era of rapid communication between districts, countries, and
continents, and in an era of magnificent abundance of all conceivable
things necessary for the happiness of humans, we have such a scarcity
that a great danger is existent of many people dying of actual
privations and want.
<p>
To maintain a relic necessary during the dark ages is not a sign of
Social Progress; and it is more significant even than that, in that,
again, here is shown that only  scientific  efforts have progressed, 
but Social Progress,  if  reflected in our charitable institutions, is
lamentably lagging behind, and has not made an inch of progress.
<p>
It also indicates that where Science takes control, progress
eventually follows. Charitable organizations which exist only for the
distribution of funds donated for that purpose, cannot be scientific,
nor are they operating under any specific natural law, but seem to
exist for two things: first, as an outlet for the emotions of those
who wish to glorify themselves to themselves or to others; second, to
maintain a condition necessary to the continuity of these emotions,
which necessitates organization.
<p>
What is the sense of distributing charity if the thing that causes the
necessity is not removed?"
<p>
This article was first written in 1934. For over one hundred years we
have been supporting "alms for the poor", obviously to no avail,
because, as Dr. Carver says, the need for charity just keeps growing.
A "guilt trip" is laid on us to support charities, not only at home,
but to send alms to foreign countries, although we have even been
informed that many times these monies and goods fall into the hands of
their wealthy scoundrels.
<p>
Technocracy recognizes the many kind and generous people who give of
themselves to help others in need. However, we would advise them to
use their generosity to join in a Technocratic movement that would
erase the problems that have sprung up in the first place, due to the
ruthless mismanagement brought on by the political and financial
system. The many problems people face, caused by famine or weather
conditions or economic circumstances, will never be solved unless the
basic reasons for them are resolved.
<p>
In a Technate, of course, the thing that causes the necessity for
charity -- the Price System (the money system) -- would be removed
totally.
<p>
Since there would be no money involved, hospitals would be built with
sections catering especially to the aged, to the infirm, and to the
mentally impaired people. Right now, most of these groups lead a very
precarious existence. Many of the elderly are threatened by cuts to
their already below-poverty pensions, and cuts to their health care.
Even in Canada they must pay a token amount for any prescribed
medicines, but a "token", to many of them, presents a real hardship.
In the U.S., their health care is almost non-existent, unless they
have some sort of medical insurance.
<p>
Making up the "street people" in the slums of every city across Canada
and the United States, are many of these same people, needing special
medical care, or just good lodgings and food. The well-to-do people
now live in cozy apartments where they can afford to have care-givers
to do their housework, their shopping, drive them to medical
appointments, or to entertainment. No reason why all the now poverty-
stricken people couldn't live in the same style. Without a money-
system, they could receive the best medical care and comfortable
lodgings so that their lives would not be in the misery they are now -
- in this Price System.
<p>
The basic reasons always filter down to one: the Price System. We are
capable of solving most physical and economic problems if there was no
money involved. It is as simple as that!
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>CRIME</h2>
<p>
Crime is on the increase. People are demanding that police be more
efficient, that the law courts give stronger sentences, and that the
death penalty be reinstated. The police say their forces are cut back
and they can't be everywhere, and when they do catch a criminal, the
high-priced lawyers get them off with a slap on the wrist. How could
crime be solved in a Technate?
<p>
You have to remember that crime is a major component of a monetary
exchange system. Crime is a very lucrative business for a lot of
people, and not just for the so-called "criminals." In fact, one
wonders why many more so-called "legal" practices should not be
categorized as crimes. How about this one? In the United States, the
government pays many private prisons to house inmates, making it
"America's newest growth industry," as one newspaper commented. Also,
the article stated, there is no assurance that it saves the country
money, or that inmates will be treated adequately, or that they will
not have their sentences lengthened so the money would continue to
roll in.
<p>
Poverty propels many young people into crime. They are well equipped
in the skills of violence to get what they want. Their schooling and
home life had not explained to them that most of the violent programs
they see on television are just make-believe. Many parents also don't
enforce the "off" switch. Even when behaviour experts point out that
many senseless violent and murderous acts are the result of acceptance
of this type of behaviour, no company producing these TV programs
would stop showing them when it meant losing the millions of dollars
they are making. And no laws are enacted to make them stop.
<p>
Approximately 98 percent of crime stems from economic causes. The rest
is probably of a medical nature. In a Technate both would be remedied
when money would be taken out of the social system.
<p>
Narcotics, for instance. A recent newspaper article was headlined: 
"New Focus On Addicts Needed In Battle Against Heroin."
<p>
"Heroin addiction is a cancerous growth that affects every major city
in the world. Fueled by the insatiable demand of its users, organized
crime flourishes because of the vast profits in supplying the product
to these users."
<p>
If a drug dealer wasn't getting those huge amounts of money for his
drugs, do you think he would be doling them out, free? The selling of
drugs would disappear, and the crime caused by the need for drugs
would cease, plus that "need" could be overcome through medical
treatment.
<p>
The health of children would also be a prime consideration. Some
children have mental problems which can begin at a very early age, can
continue on into adulthood, and cause some young people in this
category to do criminal acts, especially when they are put out on the
streets, making up a lot of the "street" population. Doctors and
teachers and parents can recognize the symptoms at an early age, but
very little medical care is administered. For some of them, their
mental instability could be resulting from cruelty at home, or from
disease, or from being exposed to viewing violence, or from an
inherited mental disability; or poverty, one of the biggest
disturbances for the healthy stability of children, where there is a
lack of good food, or lack of food of any kind. In a Technate, all
children would be given full medical comfort and care.
<p>
The many women who now suffer the indignities of prostitution would
now not have to depend upon anyone for their living, and help would be
given to them to overcome any health or drug problems.
<p>
With no money controlling our social system, a crime syndicate would
have nothing to syndicate. There would be no crime to organize.
<p>
Also, because of a brighter future offered to young people in a
Technate, their attitudes would change. They would be stimulated to
learn things that really motivated them -- things that had previously
been out of their reach because they couldn't possibly afford them, or
were not encouraged to do so.
<p>
In a Technate, imagine! NO CRIME! Because the cause of most crime
would automatically be eliminated by the design of the Technate!
<p>
It may reasonably be expected that the proportion of crime stemming
from economic causes would disappear along with the elimination of the
cause. The great reduction in crime would be matched by a
corresponding reduction in the number of police, lawyers, judges, and
prisons. There would no longer be any expensive law courts or
proceedings, although there would have to be some sort of judiciary to
settle minor disputes and crimes not related to economic causes.

<h2>WHITE COLLAR CRIME</h2>
<p>
Most of our troubles, today, seem to come from big business.  Many of
the things they do are outside the law and yet they get away with it.
Shouldn't they be charged for WHITE COLLAR CRIME?
<p>
As we have been trying to tell people for years: Take MONEY out of the
social system, and you pull the rug out from under the financial
system.
<p>
If there was no control by money, and a scientific viewpoint taken
before any technological actions were taken on the environment,
safety, education, health care, those sorts of things, neither big
business nor anyone else would be able to jeopardize our welfare by
thoughtlessly using any dangerous methods or actions.
<p>
As long as people think this present society is the only way of doing
things, then they can expect that worse is to come in the race for
money. The rights given to North American corporations with APEC and
MAI agreements point in that direction.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>DISASTERS AND CHAOS</h2>
<p>
In  your literature, you state that we would not survive if violence
damaged our technology. Do you think people would deliberately destroy
our technology? Do you think we wouldn't survive if things were
damaged?
<p>
Yes to both questions.
<p>
We had a small sample, this winter, of technology being damaged and
the chaos caused just by Nature. An ice storm knocked out the
electrical system in Eastern Canada, the worst part being in Montreal,
a city where one million people were suffering without heat, light,
and water for days, the downtown core was closed down, and it was
weeks before full utilities could be restored. 
<p>
And violence? It only takes a hockey game with the wrong outcome for
fans to become enraged enough to storm the streets, breaking
everything in sight. People have been injured in these fracases. All
this when the young people are having fun.
<p>
Just think what will happen when the Price System collapses. The panic
that would ensue would cause people to grasp whatever they could to
save themselves. Troops would be called in to try to quell people from
helping themselves, and this would add to the violence. In
retaliation, some people, in their fury, would be smashing valuable
technology without thinking of the consequences. This has all been
done before, but on a smaller scale, where it has just interrupted
equipment in some small communities.
<p>
Electrical plants, water plants, telephone plants, could be closed
down abruptly by the directors of the companies, because of lack of
money to keep them going. These mindless acts could happen because of
the mind-set that we must have MONEY to keep this technology going.
<p>
Unless people change that mind-set about money, and install the type
of social design that Technocracy has suggested, then there is not
going to be anyone there to keep all this technology going.
<p>
Using Technocracy's Technological Social Design, there would be
installed sequences with competent technical people who would
immediately determine what is to be done in case of any interruption.
Barring earthquakes, there probably would be no interruptions at all.
For instance, in the case of power lines, they would have all been put
underground in conduits. The present Price System farce is that, in
some districts, the telephone company puts its lines underground, and
the power lines could have been installed there, at the same time;
but, of course, Price System-wise, that is another company.
<p>
The present incompetent social system that is in place today would be
incapable of preventing chaos. They could only add to it.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>EDUCATION</h2>
<p>
How will education be handled in a Technate?
<p>
First of all, we'll give you a glimpse of any promise of education for
the poor children. In Maclean's, one of Canada's national weekly
magazines, one of their editors, Victor Dwyer, has suddenly discovered
"The Roots of Failure. Two new studies link poverty and illiteracy."
Now, where has this editor been all these years?
<p>
"They are both, broadly speaking, report cards on the state of public
education," he writes.
<p>
He mentions two surveys, one by Statistics Canada, and the other by
Economic Cooperation and Development, which two have also just
discovered this surprising link. So, it's an international study of
why kids fail at school.
<p>
He writes: "And both draw remarkably similar conclusions. Among them:
children from poor families have much higher illiteracy and failure
rates than their middle-class peers; parents play a critical role in
producing literate children; and governments, communities and teachers
need to take a stronger hand in promoting the goals of public
education," the surveyors conclude.
<p>
Of course, children from poor families have trouble getting a good
education. Pretty hard to concentrate on your studies when you're
hungry. Some schools try to provide some kind of meals for these
children, but it's a hit and miss proposition. Some school boards have
dropped the meal programs in order to cut costs. This program doesn't
have much priority in their minds. Many teachers provide food out of
their own pockets; but, there again, this is not adequate or
dependable.
<p>
One of the conclusions, mentioned above, is that parents should play a
critical role in producing literate children. This is also not
necessarily adequate. For one thing, many of these parents are having
to work at two or three jobs just to keep a roof over their heads, so
they can't spare the time. And possibly, they also do not have any of
the skills needed to help in the children's studies.
<p>
And another of the conclusions: "Communities need to take a stronger
hand in promoting the goals of public education."
<p>
Now we're in the political domain. Every political government has
countered that they must slash schooling costs. Schools in poorer and
middle-class neighborhoods feel these cuts the most. If nothing else,
their extra-curricular activities, like music, art, excursions to
museums etc. are curtailed. If the parents are prosperous, their
children will receive a well-rounded education because they can afford
to pay for it.
<p>
In poorer schools, their extra-curricular activities may include
hoodlumism, bullying, and fear for their lives, because these schools
no longer provide enough play-ground safety in the way of more
supervisory help by auxiliary staff.
<p>
What is the underlying cause of poor education? It's economic, isn't
it?
<p>
Technocracy's plan for education was this (after removing the present
political and monetary obstructions):
<p>
With these out of the way, the only barrier in any student's path
would be his or her own ability to proceed to higher levels of
academic attainment, or to further their interests in any subject they
wished.
<p>
While earlier stages of education would, undoubtedly, benefit from an
input of new teaching techniques and equipment, it would be at the
more advanced levels that students would experience the principal
advantages of the Technate's approach to education. Expert counseling
advice would be constantly available, and as soon as students showed
special aptitudes toward particular careers -- medical, engineering,
or otherwise -- they would be encouraged, henceforth, to specialize
their studies in those directions. Then, in the latter stages of their
educational periods, they would receive direct on-the-job training
from qualified instructors at the very location where they would
commence their functional service.
<p>
During their studies, one attractive idea that Technocracy presented,
was that students could travel throughout the Continent, on freighters
plying the waterways of the Continent, which, besides carrying
cargoes, could also provide quarters for schools so that education
could be done right on these water trains.
<p>
This is certainly not a far-fetched idea. An example of this
(certainly on a minor scale than what Technocracy suggests) was
started this year, here in the Fraser Valley. Classes are held on the
West Coast Express commuter train, which runs from Mission into
Vancouver, allowing commuters to learn subjects they needed or in
which they were interested, for the hour they are on the tracks.
<p>
Another example, for those who could afford it, was that whole classes
of students have been, and, perhaps still are, taken on ships to
different parts of the world to study the geography, arts, and music,
etc., of each country they were visiting.
<p>
The Technocracy version projected that, during their travels, students
would see how industries operated, and how arts were performed, etc.,
which would help them choose their future vocation. This would teach
them how to put back into the social system the functional arts they
had learned. This practical knowledge would enable them to use their
skills efficiently for whatever they had trained.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>ENVIRONMENT</h2>
<p>
What would Technocracy do to clean up the environment?
<p>
We've been doing our best, for over 60 years, to get people to help
us; but, talk about apathy! Only a few listened to our idea for caring
for the environment. If they had, there would be nothing to clean up.
<p>
"Shopping malls and subdivisions continue to roll, east, up the Fraser
Valley" (from Vancouver, British Columbia) wrote Russ Akins, in a
recent Abbotsford News article. "But is rampant population growth, and
the pollution that comes with it, paving a freeway toward
environmental disaster?" Ask Dr. Michael Healey, principal
investigator of the Fraser River Basin Ecosystem Study, and you'll get
this reply: "In many ways, present human activity in the lower Fraser
Basin is not sustainable. Basically, clean air in the Valley is a
thing of the past."
<p>
Further, Akins writes: "That air pollution, along with nitrate
contamination of the Abbotsford Aquifer, should be wake-up calls to
local residents."
<p>
We don't know what it takes to wake up these Valley folks, as they
have been seeing yellowing clouds of air wafting down through the
Fraser Valley for years. A few complain, but with a "guess that's the
way it is" attitude.
<p>
Professor Healey challenged the Fraser Valley University audience to
start fighting to save the environment. "If we do not change the ways
in which we manage population, land, and resources, consumption and
waste management in the Lower Mainland -- the rapidly growing urban
environment will overwhelm the region's natural resource base."
<p>
We hope this Professor `got through' to this audience. Many scientists
have been sounding alarms for years; but few people have listened. The
degradation of our environment surely should be visible to everyone,
by this time. But it obviously isn't, because we still hear the wails
of the financiers, quoted from the same newspaper today: "The Clean
Air Act will destroy our economy!" 'The Clean Water Act will destroy
our economy!" "Auto Emissions Controls will destroy our economy."
"Acid Rain Limits will destroy our economy!" "The Wilderness Act will
destroy our economy!" "The Global Warming Treaty will destroy our
Economy." The most frightful part of the above comments is that those
industries have convinced most of their workers into believing that
any environmental clean-up will affect their economy, too, by doing
away with their jobs; so they, also, join in the same wailing chorus.
<p>
But Professor Healey told his audience: "It's not business as usual in
terms of the ecology -- we simply can't afford to make bad decisions
any more. We can't carry on as we have in the past," he said.
<p>
It was well said. But, the professor's suggestions to remedy this, was
for people to become more involved; and remind their council members
of their responsibility to base their decisions on sustainability
principles. Final Report: Prospect for Sustainability makes 44
recommendations to federal, provincial and local governments.
<p>
The only trouble with those recommendations is that no political or
monetary action can ever put 44 recommendations into effect, or 10, or
even one. The three government agencies, each with its different
political party agendas, would be tumbling all over each other,
scrambling to please their voters, holding their party lines,
scrimping on the money they would have to dole out (which wouldn't
make a dent in even a dump site), and just getting in the way,
delaying any functional solution.
<p>
Furthermore, consider the amount of money it will take to clean up the
environment even in this small area, the Fraser Valley (which area we
are using here as an example. But you know this is happening in every
part of this Continent.)
<p>
First of all, just to get clean air, since most of the poisonous stuff
billowing down the Valley comes from the Vancouver region, that region
would have to clean up its act first, just to preserve this Valley
region.
<p>
Next, we would have to get automobiles off the road, the main cause of
nitrate contamination of the Abbotsford Aquifer. Since the Valley is
the bedroom of Vancouver, traffic now, all day long, is bumper to
bumper for 40 miles, going to and from work. Imagine the cost of
installing mass transportation! But this is certainly what should have
been done even 60 years ago. It still would make a difference if it
was done now -- which it could be.
<p>
We have used this small area in the Fraser Valley to describe what
pollution is doing to our part of the world, but there isn't a part of
this Continent that isn't having the same troubles, caused by
pollution.
<p>
Of course, you can't just clean up one small area of the country
without considering the whole Continental structure, as each place is
dependent upon the other. We couldn't clean the water in the Valley
when smog and garbage are spewed into the air or dumped in the rivers
and streams farther up-stream than the Valley.
<p>
Even one province cannot clean its streams when the source is in
another province, unless that province does the same thing. And,
still, there are contaminants coming through the air from the next
country and even from countries far away.
<p>
However, even while trying to do something about the environment,
continentally, there is no way of cleaning up the air, the soil, and
the water by pouring in billions and billions of dollars. For one
thing, there just isn't that amount of money in the world to begin
paying for all this cleaning.
<p>
No amount of money is going to make this Continent livable.
<p>
A new system has to be found. It should be obvious that Technocracy is
that system. There is the technology in place to clean up this
Continent. There is the expertise to do it. And the will to do it. We
cannot use this excuse any more: lack of money. Money is unable to
clean up the environment.
<p>
So the answer to that problem is that you can't depend on the present
political and monetary system to do it, because they can't. Even if
they had the best intentions in the world (although they have never
shown this side of themselves to us, yet) it is an impossibility
because there isn't enough money in the world to pay for such a clean-
up, using the present political and monetary system. Which means that
soon we will not be able to survive in the environment we are
presently building up.
<p>
Technocracy can't do anything more than it has for the environment --
we've tried to inform the public what they must do. And what the
public must do is demand a new social system; nothing else will
suffice.
<p>
At this stage, a new social system could still do a lot; but even we
don't know just how much damage has been done, and whether it can all
be repaired. However, there are so many known ways now to get toxins
out of the air, that a new approach would make a tremendous difference
almost immediately.
<p>
But you, the public, have to initiate the installation of a new social
system. Don't wait too long!
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>FOSSIL FUELS, COAL, OIL, GAS</h2>
<p>
How long will fuels, like oil and gas, last?
<p>
Fossil fuels, coal, oil, gas, were made by earth processes which
occurred millions of years ago. They lay unused by humans for perhaps
as much as a billion years. Now, in only 200 years, humans have
increased the use of, and dependence on, these fuels to such an extent
that oil is now used by the cubic mile, some 60 million barrels per
day. Coal is used by the millions of tons, and gas by the trillions of
cubic feet per day. At the above rate of consumption, how long will
these fuels last?
<p>
Any sudden halt to the use of these fuels would result in the greatest
state of chaos ever known by the human species. People would have
about as much chance of surviving a sudden stoppage as they would of
surviving a collision of Mars with earth, or a complete blackout of
the sun.
<p>
The U.S. now imports about one-half of the oil it consumes. As the oil
supply diminishes, the use of coal and gas will be increased, in an
attempt to prolong the use of all the energy-consuming devices now in
operation. As coal and gas production declines, other substitutes will
be desperately needed. How long will the  "change-over" require? Is it
possible to substitute solar, wind, and thermal energy in the
quantities required to support SIX billion world population?
<p>
<p>
The fossil fuel age has lasted 200 years, to date, and at the present
rate of consumption it is highly improbable that it can last another
century.
<p>
Our present "modern" civilization is built of non-replaceable natural
resources, not only the energy fuels, but also iron, lead, tin, zinc,
aluminum, and other important minerals. Glass and ceramics, wood,
straw, brick, masonry, made from re-occurring resources can, no doubt,
be substituted in many cases.
<p>
To date, very few plans to overcome these problems have been made. The
job will not be easy, if it can be done at all. Scientists now think
it is possible that the earth can support only about one-half the
present population, at best.
<p>
The growth in population would have to be curbed -- that is a problem
that would have to be solved, no matter if the idea is painful to some
people. If measures are not taken to do this, Nature will do it in a
most `painful' and cruel manner.
<p>
In a Technate, scientists would be given free rein to try to discover
and manufacture other materials that did not require the use of our
limited natural resources. By building things of optimum quality so
that they would last indefinitely would be another way of saving 
materials.
<p>
With the money system out of the way, all kinds of exploration can
take place, and even good ideas that have been buried because of fear
of competition, could now be put in place and enlarged upon. Electric
cars comes to mind;  this sort of thing. 
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>IMMIGRATION</h2>
<p>
What is Technocracy's attitude toward immigration?
<p>
Under the rules of the Price System game, an ever-increasing
population is demanded by those who have special interests and their
own private axes to grind. For instance, in 1991, a million-dollar
report says 100 million people are needed for Canada to operate at
peak economic efficiency. This was sponsored by The Economic Council
of Canada (a vested interest?) says increasing the country's
population nearly four times to 100 million people would create
economies of scale and domestic markets that would boost productivity.
Canada's population is gradually increasing as more people have been
allowed in; but, to date, 1998, the people already here have not
benefited. Unemployment is up, personal bankruptcies up, and the
country is being plundered in the name of productivity while our
natural resources are being sent out of the country.
<p>
Millions of dollars in Canada have been spent on a social scheme that
the government calls "Multiculturism." They want the people from other
countries to be accepted, as there has been resentment from
established Canadians that there are not enough jobs to go around. Of
course, they are all missing the point. This is not a racial problem:
it's an over-population problem.
<p>
But from the point of view of social well-being, it is obvious that if
the population is not stabilized it will expand until finally checked
by lack of the means of sustenance. This would mean a cruel fate for
millions of people.
<p>
Here, in North America, we face many crises, many of them being
brought on by the immigration of more people. Water, in many areas, is
both in short supply, and polluted. Soil is polluted and suffering
from erosion. Our infrastructure is in serious disrepair; educational
facilities are inadequate; access to health care is strained to the
breaking point. There is so much poverty; there is poor or non-
existent housing, and there are severely malnourished children. All of
these are a further indication of the present system's politicians to
adequately care for the population we now have, much less more, which
they are advocating.
<p>
Our population must be stabilized; our environment must be cleaned up;
our resources must be conserved, and we must do whatever is necessary
to preserve this planet for the benefit of all the species still left
on this earth we call home.
<p>
To do this, we must apply our technological expertise for the benefit
of humankind -- not to their detriment. This can be done if we
introduce functional government, as outlined in Technocracy's design
set out for this purpose.
<p>
Here in North America we have the resources, know-how, and trained
personnel to show the world how this concept can be applied. We then
can lead by example, and show the rest of the world how to make the
best use of the resources of the world, not only to save this planet
but also to build a worthwhile and secure future for all that live on
it. By improving the status of their own countries, there would be no
need for people to immigrate; to leave their homes for a foreign
country.
<p>
If you are concerned, as you should be, about our chances of survival,
then investigate Technocracy.
<p>
<hr>

that it delivers the goods. -- Carl Sagan
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>LABOUR UNIONS</h2>
<p>
What would Technocracy do about Labour Unions?
<p>
There would be no need of Labour Unions. Since there would be no money
being paid out for salaries, there would be no use for bargaining for
better wages. There could probably be some kind of grievance
committees within each industry to bring major or minor disputes
before some judicial persons knowledgeable about the handling of such
controversies, without a raucous discord disrupting the work of other
employees or other public services.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>POVERTY</h2>
<p>
Some people say: "The poor will always be with us." Yet, according to
Technocracy, there won't be any poor in a Technate.
<p>
By the word "poor", we mean people who are in a state of poverty,
where they suffer from lack of food and lodging and are deprived of a
comfortable life.
<p>
There will not be any people in poverty in a Technate. How could there
be? Once we were rid of the Price System?  People would be able to
live in decent dwellings; they would be able to have good food; good
clothing.
<p>
Some people say to us that these poor would squander all these things;
that they would be grabbing everything they could lay their hands on.
No, they wouldn't. As soon as they realized that these essentials were
available to them at any time they wanted, they would settle down to
enjoy their existence, and explore all the other things open to them
that had heretofore been beyond their reach.
<p>
Wouldn't you, if you were in their place?
<p>
And, it wouldn't just be the destitute people who would benefit from a
Technate social system. In our present Price System life, when you
think about it, we are all poor in one way or another. Without the
interference of money, this old world would be a nicer place to live.
The environment would be cleaner; there would be no crime; there would
be more opportunities for everyone to delve into pastimes they would
like to do, instead of the rush-rush-rush just to make a living.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>WAR</h2>
<p>
One of your magazines stated that probably there never would have been
World War II, or any other wars since then. Can you explain that?
<p>
Technocracy offered its Technological Social Design to the people of
this Continent in 1932. If the program had been put in place at that
time, and the political and Price System disarmed, then the citizens
here would have been living full and satisfying lives. They would all
have flourished both in prosperity and well-being. They would have
been an example for the world to follow.
<p>
Instead of that, the people in Europe, still in the throes of a
depression after the disastrous World War I, were enticed into
planning a planned World War II, and the people of this Continent,
also deprived in our depression, were conned into participating in it.
<p>
A Technate certainly would have been a model for European nations, and
if the citizens of this Continent had not been misled into denying
this new social system in 1932, and if we could have shown other
countries how to prosper without money, there doubtless would not have
been that war, nor all these other killing atrocities, since.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>APATHY</h2>
<p>
Considering the deteriorating trend of current events and the still
widespread public apathy, are not Technocracy's present efforts an
exercise in futility?
<p>
They well could be; but, if so, where do we go from here? No one has
yet come up with a factual refutation of Technocracy's social
analysis, which states that the impact of technologically-produced
abundance is steadily breaking down the scarcity-conceived structure
of the North American Price System, and it will eventually become
completely inoperable. To our knowledge, no one has yet come up with
an alternative program to Technocracy's social program to succeed the
Price System's demise.
<p>
Technocracy's social program is the natural synthesis of the
application of the scientific method to a particular social problem --
that of determining how to keep the physical equipment of North
America operating when the Price System control ceased to operate.
This was the prime consideration; for, roughly 90 percent of North
Americans are completely dependent upon the continuous operation of
their technological equipment for their very survival. Without the
uninterrupted operation of that equipment, we not only would not have
abundance; we would not have our lives.
<p>
We had a sample this winter, in Quebec and Ontario, of what can happen
when there is an interruption in the continuous operation of
technological equipment as Nature interrupted with ice storms so that
one million people in Montreal, alone, were without heat, light, and
water for days.
<p>
Whether Technocracy's continued efforts are an exercise in futility
still remains to be seen; but if they are, it will be because most
North Americans were not sufficiently interested in their future to
investigate the only social program which could have saved them from
oblivion.
<p>
But we are not discouraged. If we were, we wouldn't be here. The
apathy in general is tolerated; people go along with it and go about
their lives on a day-to-day basis. They think that some politicians 
will look after them, even though they are going to make a bigger mess
than when they first started. We all realize, in our minds, that
things are getting worse; things are not getting any better. In the
last 40 years, our lifestyle has deteriorated. Our environment has
deteriorated -- everything that we depend upon as a species. Our
lifestyle is deteriorating at a rapid rate. But people do nothing
about it. At least, Technocrats, if this whole society comes down
around our ears, can stand and say "We tried."
<p>
Technocracy is an educational research organization. It is not here
for any other purpose than to attempt to inform the people of North
America of the nature of the problems which now confront us, and what
can be done to alleviate these problems to bring about a society more
in keeping with the age in which we live. Technocracy is not
responsible for the problems we have, today. Technocracy can do little
or nothing about them, except talk to people to try to make them
understand what is happening. And these people will have to join
together to demand that the changes suggested by Technocracy be
instituted.
<p>
If Technocracy disappeared tomorrow, the problems that we talk about
will still exist, and they will still continue to degrade our society.
Nothing will change until people think in terms of function, and not
in terms of `the bottom line' -- money.
<p>
We can only hope that we reach enough people so that when social
dislocation becomes serious enough so that the majority of people
realize that we are not going to get through it; that we are not going
to survive it; that at some time they will remember they went to a
Technocracy lecture, or read some Technocracy literature, and the
light will come on, and they will realize that maybe what these
Technocrats had to say was worth listening to; that it will give them
a glimmer of hope that all is not hopeless; and that a new social
system must be installed.
<p>
Our hope is that when social dislocation occurs, violence will not
occur to damage the technology and equipment which is keeping us
alive. Because, if that happens, and the technology of today becomes
incapacitated and destroyed, then we have no hope of survival.
<p>
We can only hope people realize that when the monetary system
collapses all that is lost is only money. All the other functions can
continue -- your communication systems; your transportation systems;
your health sequence, and education, etc. They do not rely on money.
They only rely on the highly trained technological personnel who
understand that particular sequence and can keep it operating.
<p>
Only if we realize that the essential thing in North America, and
other parts of the world, is to keep all the modern technology
operating for the benefit of everybody, will we have any hope of
survival. If we resort to violence and chaos, then it's game over.
<p>
So, let's think about what keeps us alive. Let's think about what can
improve our living standards today, and let's be prepared for what

<h2>WE TECHNOCRATS HAVE QUESTIONS TOO</h2>
<p>
When you see these headlines in your newspapers or magazines, don't
they make you wonder what is wrong with our social system? Don't you
go on to read the whole article? These are all recent headlines. Seems
like we didn't make too much progress in 1997.
<p>
1. We are all on welfare; everyone gets welfare for a significant part
of their lives, and we're all on welfare right now. When they say
they're cutting welfare back, don't worry. Nobody is suggesting we cut
back on your welfare. It's only that welfare that provides shelter and
food that's to be cut back.
<p>
2. Dose of reality big chill for young seeking work. The number of
Canadians with jobs dropped, and tens of thousands of discouraged
young people fled the labor force.
<p>
3. Earth not able to support standard of living desired.
<p>
4. Money is mightier than the sword. CEOs will be the warlords of the
21st century.
<p>
5. More than a bandage is needed to cure these ills....We must start
by changing the way we view how we live together. The solution lies in
knowing that it takes a thousand people living in poverty to make one
rich person.
<p>
6. Being poor means being less healthy.
<p>
7. Limit the number of mouths to feed, Worldwatch tells UN forum.
<p>
8. San Francisco considers permanent campground for poor living in
cars.
<p>
9. Progress sought on child-poverty plans.
<p>
10. U.S. rich get richer and poor poorer as middle a bit better off,
data shows. In Canada, family incomes remain well below the levels of
the late 1980s, due to small pay hikes and higher taxes.
<p>
11. Care of the elderly borders on catastrophic.
<p>
12. Newest medicare figures aid doctors' privatization drive.
<p>
13. Wanted: Jobs. Unemployment is top issue, yet no party has an
answer.
<p>
14. Despair as bad as cigarettes in triggering ills, study says.
<p>
15. 1 in 5 workers does overtime, figures show.
<p>
16. UN says poor food kills 6 million children a year. Even in the
U.S., children are living in "horrible" conditions...
<p>
<p>
17. 29 Mayors (in U.S.) see hunger as growing problem.
<p>
18. APEC, Vancouver's biggest-ever international gathering, to cost
more than $64 million, with direct spending benefits estimated at $23
million.
<p>
19. Over 90 per cent of the transactions of the world economy now are
speculative and abstract -- currency trades, derivatives and the like.
Over 50 percent of all world trade is made up of internal transfers
within big transnational corporations.
<p>
20. Oh Canada! Land of Equal Opportunity?! One of the big Canadian
myths is that, unlike other Third World countries, the difference in
wealth between the rich and the poor is minimal. The truth is that the
wealthiest 20 percent of the population enjoy a massive 68 percent of
the national wealth. The top 10 percent own more than half of the
country's wealth. The bottom 20 percent own less than 1 percent.
<p>
Commentary:
<p>
These are just a few of the disturbing headlines which appeared in
local and national papers in 1997. We haven't even touched the ones
about the declining environment, the endangered species, and the
present political and monetary schemes that are dangerous to our
health. Very, very frightening! Especially after you read books like,
When Corporations Rule the World -- The ABCs of Finance Capitalism, by
David Korten -- an indication of what is to come.
<p>
None of it should have happened, nor needs to happen. Perhaps people
will awake in '98! Demand a Technate in '98!
