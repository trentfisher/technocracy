Editor, The Times, Nanaimo, B. C., May 11, 1996.
<p>
In the April 16 edition of your newspaper, there was a column, by
David J. Weston, titled: ``Driven to insanity. Ours is a culture
pervaded by competition and violence.''
<p>
He says (we suffer from) ``...violence perpetrated by the political
and economic system under which we struggle.'' Then, he adds
another quotation: ``We are driven to acts of collective and
personal insanity by the constraints of a system of our own
devising...time is holding a good seed for the future which it will
eventually reveal to us.''
<p>
I'm going to reveal that ``good seed'' in this letter to the
editor! Read on!
<p>
Mr. Weston says, ``The challenge for us as humans is: Are we
willing to question the political ideology that has been imposed on us
by an elite, which drives us to violently compete with each other to
their advantage.'' Hear! Hear!
<p>
It may relieve Mr. Weston, emotionally, to cite
things that are wrong -- kind of like a Hyde Park spout-off
-- but that doesn't present any solution.
<p>
What is urgently needed in these times of social disintegration is a
blueprint of social operations that is in intellectual and technical
accord with our new age of technology.
<p>
Technocracy has such a blueprint. It is time that every citizen make
it a point to find out what that blueprint has to offer -- then get
active; investigate this Organization's solution to get things moving
in a sane direction.
<p>
Science applied to the social order -- versus politics and
philosophy -- <EM>facts</EM>,  not
<EM>beliefs,</EM>'' is the power that will cause us to
move, <EM>together</EM>,..............Technocracy
represents the ``good seed.''
