<BLOCKQUOTE>Throughout recorded history, people have been taught to
be loyal to many things, including witchcraft, politics, governments,
cities, nations, to business enterprises, and wars. Even school
children are taught to be loyal to their individual schools. Well,
O.K., but much of this loyalty has been misplaced, especially when it
has been taught by those who have something to sell for their own
profit.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
<EM>LOYAL -- Faithful to one's oath, or
obligations; allegiance to a government; faithful to any person or
thing conceived as imposing obligations. --
Webster</EM>
<p>
Often people are loyal to things which no longer exist;
to things which have become useless. Many were loyal to the horse and
buggy long after the automobile had proved to be far more efficient as
a means of transportation. Presently, many are loyal to a political
and economic system which has become so obsolete that it allows 38
million Americans to live in poverty, including four million children,
even though technology can now produce plenty for all. This is the
type of loyalty which condemns so many people to unnecessary
hardships, wastes the earth's non-replaceable resources in the
production of inferior products, and allows the shipment of resources
abroad -- which assists the increase in population of nations
already over-populated -- in order to increase sales and
profits.

POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC METHODS OF SOCIAL CONTROL</BLOCKQUOTE>
ARE MAN-MADE
<HR>
<p>
Many have been taught to believe that loyalty to one's country, and to
a particular political, or economic, method is one and the same thing.
Nonsense! A country is a certain number of square miles of land area,
with a certain number of people on it. It includes the rivers,
mountains, forests, minerals, and cabbage plants. A country exists as
a physical entity. On the other hand, a political government, or an
economic system, are methods -- methods designed by man as a means
of social control -- which are an entirely different thing. They
are not physical entities. They exist only as methods, or plans, for
controlling human behaviour. Any method, or plan, of social control
which motivates mankind to waste his own natural resources is
sabotaging all present and future generations, and is proof that those
methods are, at best, obsolete. The belief that a country and its
social control techniques are one and the same, allows political
governments, or an economic system, to continue long after it becomes
a useless burden to the people of the area.
<p>
Political and economic methods of social control are man-made;
they can be modified, replaced, or trashed by mankind. Governments,
regardless of their position, from left to right or centre; economic
methods, based on any value system, are all man-made and are not
designed according to any natural law, so when they become obsolete
they should become museum pieces, and new designs effected which
better serve the civilizations they are expected to assist under the
new conditions.
<p>
Some form of social control is necessary to avoid anarchy and chaos,
but it doesn't follow that the method must be political, or that the
economic system must be based on human toil, scarcity, or debt. It
could be scientifically designed, using scientific methods rather than
the beliefs and opinions of some political party.
<p>
The present politico/economic system `grew' haphazardly since before
recorded history, and is continued today because it is profitable to a
very few who are able to control it for their own benefit. If social
operations were designed scientifically in accordance with modern
technological conditions, with distribution methods to allow the
distribution of the plenty this Continent's technology can already
produce, all North Americans could be lifted out of poverty, crime for
profit eliminated, and the wastage of natural resources reduced, by
building efficient housing, cities, transportation, etc. These things
can never be done by the use of a debt-ridden,
politically-inspired economic system of price, based on scarcity
values.
<p>
The future of the human species requires the loyalty of the people to
be the result of far more careful studies of factual information
concerning the requirements of human life in a modern technological
age, and of the environmental conditions for survival. After some 75
years of research, Technocracy Inc. has the only Technological Social
Design on earth. <EM>It deserves consideration by every North
American</EM> who is more loyal to his country than to its
man-made methods.
