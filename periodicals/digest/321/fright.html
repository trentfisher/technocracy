<EM>Frightening Future? It certainly is. We have been
warned about all these hazards for years and years -- over 60
years' warning from Technocracy alone -- plus all the warnings, in
later years, by the media, who finally tumbled to the fact that maybe
we do have something to worry about. Mind you, they still reject any
solution to the problem.
</EM>
<p>
<EM> And there is a solution!</EM>
<p>
<EM> It's a very simple one. Get rid of the system
that is causing all our problems, like poverty, environmental damage,
mass unemployment, stress, over-population.
</EM>
<p>
Some of the most respected men and women in science,
over 60 years ago, did fourteen years of research to find out why
technology was being misused and was not in synchronization with the
social field. They discovered an abominable interference by politics
and money, and they explained that, in order to provide the citizens
of this Continent with what they must have, in order for them to live
in comfort, that both politics and money must be abolished. This has
never been done! The problem and the solution were promulgated by
Technocracy's scientists, but the financial interests saw to it that
the social system they inspired, remained intact.
<p>
So, today, what do we have? We have millions of
people living in poverty, fearful of the future. And well they may,
because if the system keeps on the way it is going, it is doubtful if
there will be a future for much longer, maybe for this planet, but we
may not be included.
<p>
Even though we have been made aware of the problems
in nearly every sphere you can mention, nothing has ever been done to
correct them. Do you see any less traffic on the roads to lessen the
pollution? Do you see any waters cleaned up? Do you see any solutions
to unemployment, poverty, and sickness?
<P>Look at this list, and see if you can remember any
solution offered for any of them.
<P>
Professor David Suzuki recently reviewed a book,
<EM>``Our Stolen Future''</EM> about the toxins still
being used and the damage they have already done to the soil, plants,
insects, birds, animals, including us, where he points out that: ...
``Even when a problem is identified, there are tremendous obstacles
to obtaining the funding...'' Right there is the obstacle --
that need not be there -- to correct the mistakes being made with
the incorrect use of technology. Suzuki points out that a researcher
investigating toxic effects of chemicals on bird eggs, for example,
may be unaware of studies on fish tumors or behavioral anomalies in
children. With adequate funding, these studies could encompass the
whole complexity of toxicology, and the effects of technology on it.
<P>
And also on the list are these other examples of
problems that need never be, if we had made the necessary change to
our social system, away from politics and money, to one using energy
accounting. (Explained in the booklet, <EM> Technocracy,
Technological Social Design.</EM>
<p>
``Natural Born Killers'' -- a United Nations report that
humankind is extinguishing life on Earth faster than even the
alarmists had foretold.
<p>
``Stage is set for major upheaval in the U.S.'' --
``Unless the private sector finds a way to both make money and
re-establish trust in the workplace, look for social unrest
unrivaled in this century.'' This was a column written in the St.
Petersburg (Florida) Times in March 1996, by Warren Bennis, a
professor of business administration at the University of Southern
California. But, compassionate though he appears to be, he offers no
solution -- ``I have no pat answers to solve the problems and
assuage the anguish I see all around.''
<p>
``Outcasts Up Close -- At least 400 people are believed to be
living on the streets of Victoria. Up to two-thirds of them suffer
from serious mental disorders. Yet demand for housing far outstrips
supply.'' This is in a small city -- the capital city of British
Columbia -- but the numbers are magnified in larger cities all over
Canada and the United States.
<P>
``A Matter of Money'' -- At the end of her
rope, one woman wonders what the future holds.'' -- A story from
a Vancouver district, about a woman who has only the prospect of
sleeping on the street. She is a hairdresser by trade, with jobs
coming and going, so she had to take welfare. In order to get off
welfare she received a student loan for $4,000 but discovered that the
money quickly disappeared. To complicate matters, she has numerous
medical complications...Now, she is about to be cut off welfare, lost
in the reams of red tape, and she has nowhere else to go. And the
newspaper stated that this story could likely be retold in numerous
versions by numerous people with similar circumstances in a society
that tries to help, but falls short.
<P>
``Canadians uneasy over jobs.'' ``One in
three Canadians surveyed in a recent poll expected to lose their
current jobs within five years. And one-quarter of working
Canadians polled said they were ``underemployed'' -- working
in less-skilled jobs for lower pay than they're qualified
for.'' And that's a story that is echoed all over the Continent.
Included in this, of course, is the anguish suffered by the families
trying to make ends meet, the losses of their savings and homes in
many cases, and their hopes and dreams perhaps for education, travel,
a comfortable, happy lifestyle.
<p>
``Rapid Growth Puts Squeeze On Health'' -- A consultant
calling for radical changes to ``cut costs'' at local hospitals
predicts that rapid population growth (40 per cent) will pose a major
challenge -- another little problem that has never been addressed:
the Population Explosion. Too many people on a too-small
land-area impinging on too few resources. This particular study
was for the Fraser Valley area in British Columbia, but is indicative
of over-population problems foisted upon any Continental area by
monetary practices not taking into account the results of their
political actions.
<P>
And for any of you mowing your small expanse of a
lawn, where nary a buttercup dares show its head, how would you like
to be confined to just that little piece of land? Scariest of all are
the facts about population growth.  And here they are -- they tell
you just how much earth you will have left to stand on, unless
something is done to curb population growth. (Better hang on to those
buttercups, you may have to eat them.) Excluding the 5.1 million
square miles of Antarctica, the world has a total land area of
52,512,087 sq. mi. Of this total, only 11 percent -- 6,727,574 sq.
mi. -- is arable soil for the human race to grow the farm products
needed to support life. The total world population at mid-1995 was
5.7 billion people. (The increase for 1995 was 100 million.) When you
do your math., you find that the acreage per capita is 0.8 acres of
arable soil per capita. This amount, with an average quality of soil,
is barely enough to maintain a human at a sustenance level. Which
means: the world's present population is already greater than can be
supported at adequate levels. Any additional population can be
supported only by a declining standard for those presently here.
<p>
<HR><BLOCKQUOTE>
This is a new condition for humanity, and is not well
understood.
</BLOCKQUOTE><HR>
<p>
Everyone surely realizes by now that they themselves must take action
to make sure we continue to survive on this beautiful planet of ours.
It certainly is worth making the supreme effort to do so; but, really,
all it takes is to investigate exactly what can be done. So far, no
one has ever offered a logical solution, except for Technocracy. If
you thoroughly inspect any alternative mentioned you will conclude
that it could not possibly work under a political nor a Price System.
Technocracy proposes its Technological Social Design, as it is the
only one compatible with modern times.
<p>
We ask that you join us in demanding a change of social system so
that, instead of being fearful of our future, we can enjoy a safe and
plentiful one.
