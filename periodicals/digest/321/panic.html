<p>
<EM>A major threat to our industrial society lies in the
uncertainty of how North Americans will react to the growing problem
of unemployment within the Price System. Panic must be averted if
human life and civilization are to continue on this Continent.
</EM>
<P>
A prankster loosened a light bulb. To see what had
happened, someone lighted a match. Fire from the match ignited a palm
frond, then spread quickly to some highly inflammable decorations.
Thus started Boston's disastrous Cocoanut Grove dance hall fire which
in 1942 claimed 491 lives and injured scores more.
<p>
After the blaze had been brought under control and it
was possible to determine the reasons for the extremely high casualty
rate, firemen who entered the ruins found bodies piled four and five
deep in front of doorways. Not all had died from the flames. Some had
been trampled to death in the frenzied stampede to reach exits, while
others were simply smothered by those above them. Investigations
showed that most casualties were entirely unnecessary -- having
resulted from sheer panic.
<p>
<STRONG>Panic has been responsible</STRONG> for
countless deaths and injuries throughout human history. This
overpowering, often groundless, fear occurs in instances when some
incident so disturbs the established routine of life that temporary
mental blocks disrupt the thinking processes of those affected. Their
first response, then, is to the inborn instinct for survival rather
than to intelligence -- frequently with tragic results. The causes
of panic seem to have been endless.
<p>
On a Sunday evening in 1938, many radios in United
States and Canada were tuned to a certain network as a `newscaster'
was reporting the landing of mysterious spacecraft on a New Jersey
farm. Soon, as the report of the landing unfolded, more and more
listeners became convinced this planet had been invaded by superior
beings from outer space. Many fled their homes with such few
belongings as they could quickly muster, some committed suicide, while
still others indulged in a variety of irrational acts which clearly
showed the effects of panic. Had they simply taken the trouble to
check other stations they would have learned that what they had heard
was a play. It was, in fact, a radio dramatization of H. G. Wells'
book `The War of the Worlds.' Such behaviour, however, is a
characteristic manifestation of panic patterns.
<p>
The 1929 stock market crash produced numerous
examples of panicky behaviour. Only a few days before the bottom
dropped out of an exceptionally successful Price System era, a
prominent citizen proclaimed that the United States had `reached a
permanently high level of prosperity.' Since he confirmed the general
feelings of the day, most people were totally unprepared when stock
prices took their October nose-dive. Suddenly aware of the threat
to their security, they reverted to primeval instincts rather than to
intelligent appraisal of the situation. Panic overwhelmed them.
<p>
We are more interested here in the human reactions to
the market crash than in its economic causes. Bedlam reigned during
the week from October 23rd to 29th (Black Tuesday - described as
the biggest and blackest day in Wall Street history) as stockholders
tried desperately to dispose of their shares. In hundreds of brokerage
offices, men clustered around ticker tape machines watching their
fortunes being wiped out. Many jumped out of skyscraper windows;
others shot themselves. More significant, perhaps, than these personal
tragedies was the decision of millions of citizens across the
Continent to withdraw their cash holdings from bank accounts. The
resulting heavy run forced closure of numerous banks, doubtlessly thus
intensifying the immediate effects of the crash.
<p>
<STRONG>Panic has seldom affected</STRONG> large
areas or populations because stimuli are rarely severe enough to have
so general an effect. The cited cases, however, clearly show that they
can and do occur. This possibility holds a considerable danger for the
people of this land area. Should something happen to precipitate panic
on a major Continental basis, it could completely disrupt those
physical operations upon which depends the lives of most North
Americans. The social peril of widespread panic therefore has the most
serious implications.
<p>
<STRONG>Our Price System economy</STRONG> presents
the greatest threat of a major panic-arousing stimulus. Proving
progressively more incapable of distributing the abundance being
thrust upon it, this scarcity-control mechanism is showing
advanced signs of deterioration. What will happen as ever-growing
numbers of citizens can no longer sell their manhours in return for
the dollars which represent their sole present means of livelihood? As
layoffs steadily increase in industry, the question of possible public
reaction must be soberly considered.
<p>
North America's industrial mechanism is the most complex in the world,
and therefore also the most tenuous. All parts are so interrelated and
interdependent -- even within the Price System -- that damage
to, or shutdown of, any part has a chain reaction effect upon the
others. The physical equipment which produces, transports,
distributes, communicates and otherwise provides vital services is an
entity quite separate from the dispensable financial superstructure
overriding it. Much of the peril of panic rests in the possible
failure of those so stricken to recognize this important distinction.
<p>
<STRONG>It cannot be emphasized</STRONG> <EM>too strongly</EM> that
North Americans' welfare is inextricably linked to the continuous
operation of the installed technology. By chance more than by plan, a
vast array of technology has developed on this Continent --
especially north of the Rio Grande. Because it was devised primarily
to serve business rather than the needs of society, this technology,
which receives its energy usually from far distant sources, `growed
like Topsy' from innumerable starting points. Consequently, it is far
short of the possible and desirable; but inevitably, because of the
growing needs of business which were generously abetted by the land
area's resource riches, the separate entities grew together to become
welded into a unit. North Americans have become increasingly dependent
upon that technology in direct proportion to its growth.
<p>
We have described the North American industrial
mechanism as the world's most tenuous. In other words, it is the most
vulnerable to crippling damage because of the long flow-lines of
energy and supply between points of origin and use. Probably the most
familiar are the high-voltage transmission lines carrying the
electrical energy that activates most types of industrial technology,
performs countless other jobs, and provides virtually the only type of
illumination used on this continent today.
<p>
Electricity has become so much a part of our lives
that, even though many have lived in unserviced areas, it is difficult
to imagine being without it. We flick a light switch, shave, turn on a
radio or television set, toast bread, cook meals, refrigerate foods,
and use numerous other appliances with full confidence that the
necessary electrical power will be forthcoming. But sometimes the
service is unexpectedly interrupted. A high wind may uproot a tree and
throw it across the transmission lines causing one or more breaks. The
interruption is usually brief, but while it lasts our vaunted modern
conveniences are just so much junk causing varying degrees of human
frustration. Because the source of power is far removed from our
homes, we have no personal control over it. This all-important
energy supply is temporarily cancelled out by the chance falling of a
tree, thus exemplifying the essentially tenuous character of our
entire industrial mechanism.
<p>
<STRONG>Past experience indicates</STRONG> that where prior
training is given on how to meet specific emergencies, panic can be
prevented. Fire drill in schools, for instance, has often proved its
merit. This is strikingly shown in the contrasting behaviour of pupils
caught in a December, 1958, blaze in a Chicago parochial school. Of
the ninety children who perished, most were found jammed near windows
or doors in the familiar escape-attempt pattern of the
panic-stricken. Those who remembered their fire drill survived.
First of all, thanks to the cool-headed direction of a
12-year-old boy who remembered and applied his training, they
lay on the floor to avoid the enveloping smoke. When help arrived,
they were led to safety while forming a line by holding onto each
other's belts.
<p>
Was there ever an occasion when wide-spread panic
might have been expected, it was in 1940 when London and other British
cities were bombed interminably by the German Luftwaffe. There was,
however, no such general wave of fear. On the contrary, the air raids
almost reached the point of being considered routine by the civilian
populations, who proceeded to shelters as soon as the warning sirens
were sounded. Despite the heavy loss of life, panic never became a
major problem during the Battle of Britain because the people became
conditioned to the raids and knew how to meet them.
<p>
This is largely explained by psychiatrist Joost A. M.
Merloo in his book `Patterns of Panic.' In part, he observes: `The
tension of a mysterious danger is even more unbearable than danger
itself. People hate the vacuum of an unknown situation. They want
security. They even prefer war to the insecure expectation of a war
with its threat of enemy surprise. This vague fearful expectation acts
on their fantasies. They anticipate all kinds of mysterious dangers;
they begin to provoke them. It is the evocation of fear and danger in
order to escape the tension of insecurity.'
<p>
<HR><BLOCKQUOTE>
Fear of the unknown
prompts irrational behavior.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<p>
Here is contained the essence of the causes and
expressions of panic. Fear of the unknown prompts irrational behavior.
Thus defined, panic becomes a predictable trait subject to preventive
therapy involving the reduction or removal of the causal fears. The
most satisfactory means of achieving this end is through education
which explains the reasons of such fears.
<p>
<STRONG>It has been learned further</STRONG> that
frightened people respond to the direction of `emergent leaders.' The
boy who saved many of his classmates in the Chicago school fire was
such a person. Psychiatrist James Tyhurst describes the emergent
leader as a person who is not ordinarily interested in community
affairs, but during disaster is moved to action by the unusual events,
and takes over direction of resource or relief work coolly and
sensibly. It is during a disaster's initial impact, says Dr. Tyhurst,
that people are most influenced by others. In this comparatively brief
interval, if anyone exhibits fear, those around him are instantly
infected. Conversely, it is equally true that a strong leader can
exert a steadying influence on persons bewildered by events.
<p>
While the emergent leader undoubtedly has an
important role in any crisis, and while it has been observed that one
usually comes forward, no prior dependence should be placed upon such
occurrence. Personnel should be trained ahead of time to handle
emergencies. For this reason we have police forces, fire departments,
inhalator squads, ambulance operators, communications and
transportation trouble shooters, and other groups of specially trained
emergency personnel. They, however, are specialists in handling a
situation AFTER it occurs. Their training does not, for the most part,
equip them to anticipate and prevent a danger. Training of this type
requires a somewhat different approach.
<p>
<STRONG>The threat of panic</STRONG> resulting from growing
deterioration of the Price System is the most serious ever to confront
North Americans. Stemming from the uncompromising conflict between an
economy of scarcity and an environment of technology-produced
abundance, panic threatens to disrupt completely that installed
equipment which must operate constantly to sustain the citizens of
this land area. Were the equipment to grind to a halt it could not be
restarted because of the utter dependence of all parts upon the
continued operation of all others. This would automatically ring down
the curtain on the lives of most North Americans.
<p>
<STRONG>Should it be doubted</STRONG> that any such
large-scale disruption might occur,  one need only observe a few
things which have happened, in the absence of panic, that support the
threat warning.
<p>
<STRONG>In the fall of 1960,</STRONG> Canada's two major railroads
were almost stopped by an impending strike of certain personnel groups
who demanded pay increases which the railroad companies were not
prepared to meet. This typical Price System dispute failed at that
time to halt a major utility only because of last-minute political
legislation enacted to defer the stoppage to a later date. While such
a stoppage would have seriously impeded the flow of food and other
materials, this consideration alone would not have stopped the strike
which legal action stopped for the time being. Action of this type can
be effective only as long as existing or emergently-passed laws
continue to be recognized and obeyed -- a factor that is strongly
modified by the degree of existing economic stability.
<p>
Vancouver had an example in April 1995 of mass
behaviour which clearly illustrated how people under emotional stress
can exceed the possibility of being controlled. Each year some
Canadian city plays host to the winners of the hockey playoffs which
brings together the eastern and western pennant holders in the game
that decides the national winner. In vexation of the loss by the
Vancouver team, the crowd demonstrated, noisily and boisterously,
following the game. Windows were smashed, furniture was broken, people
were assaulted, and traffic was immobilized.  In a few square blocks
of downtown Vancouver, occurred far too many illegal incidents for the
police to handle. Fortunately, most participants were in a good mood,
and, however inane and stupid their actions, were not maliciously
inclined. But given the appropriate stimuli, their exuberance could
have turned toward any of several directions, including panic.
<p>
The potentially disastrous impact of wide-spread
panic upon North America's social mechanism has already been stressed.
Instances such as those cited above, which posed a threat even without
panic, serve as indicators of the considerable peril attending the
intrusion of panic. Should an advanced deterioration of the Price
System precipitate this peril, there would be no possibility of
restraining the wave of violence and destruction which would likely
ensue. It must therefore be stopped before it starts.
<p>

Knowledge is the best antidote to panic
</BLOCKQUOTE><HR>
<p>
Knowledge is the best antidote to panic in any form. When people know
what to expect and what action to take when the expected happens --
as during the Battle of Britain -- the inclination to panic is
reduced to a minimum. North Americans must accordingly learn what is
happening to their Price System society and why its inability to
distribute abundance makes it the greatest menace ever to confront the
citizens of this land area.
<p>
The study of this problem has been the specific
self-assumed task of Technocracy Inc. Immediately after World War
I, the originators of this organization realized that the Price System
had entered its final phase of operation on this Continent, its
post-dated death warrant having been written by the unprecedented
injection of labor-saving technology into industrial processes.
The Technical Alliance research group saw that, whether or not an
adequate social program was designed to meet North American's
production and distribution needs, the Price System would eventually
buckle under the load it was never equipped to carry. The first step,
then, was to design a mechanism which <STRONG>would</STRONG> meet
those needs. This was accomplished in Technocracy's social
blueprint which culminated years of intensive
research. (See the book
<cite>Technocracy -- Technological Social Design</cite>)
<P>
Having the program, and implementing it, are two
different things. Yet, it must be done if North Americans are to
survive the end of the Price System. Bridging the gap from the old to
the new could be the most hazardous and decisive period in our
history. Most of Technocracy's organizational effort is now directed
toward achieving a successful transition.
<p>
This requires the development of a corps of informed,
self-disciplined citizens to give direction to their fellow North
Americans confused by the developing economic crisis. The corp's
personnel must understand how a Price System operates before they can
further realize why it is incapable of distributing abundance; they
must realize the need of effecting a smooth transition void of
interruption of the physical operations which sustain the citizenry of
North America; and they must have some knowledge of human behavioral
patterns under varying circumstances.
<p>
<STRONG>Since most people lack the social awareness
to inform themselves</STRONG> along the foregoing lines prior to a
crisis, it falls directly on the shoulders of those citizens with the
necessary initiative to prepare themselves for leadership roles. While
emergent leaders may come forward to help prevent panic, the most
functional persons will be <EM>prepared </EM>leaders who know what to do
under panic-conducive circumstances to prevent it. The more
informed personnel there is at such a time, the less likely are the
chances of havoc-wreaking panic.
<p>
There are familiar echoes of the past in the pronouncements daily
being voiced to socially unconscious North Americans. Business
leaders, while feeling less confident of the future than at any time
since World War II, are trying to convince their prospective
customers, or themselves (or both) that the present difficulty is
merely a `period of readjustment' that will right itself in the near
future. Meanwhile, they are concentrating on the `gimmick market'
-- a grand selling binge of anything that will help prevent the
buying public from thinking seriously about what is happening. As a
result, North Americans are probably the least prepared for the major
change, coming inexorably their way, of any populace in history. The
potential for consuming panic is accordingly the greatest to occur.
<p>
<STRONG>Where the issue of survival is paramount
</STRONG>it is irrelevant to ask whether panic can be avoided in the
forthcoming Price System crisis. It <STRONG>MUST</STRONG> be avoided if
human life and civilization are to continue on this Continent.
