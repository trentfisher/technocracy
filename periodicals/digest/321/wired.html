<EM>If there is any lingering doubt in anyone's mind about
technology bringing about social change, he or she should peruse the
65th anniversary issue of the CANADIAN GEOGRAPHIC Magazine,
November-December, 1995 issue. It is a graphic pictorial and
written evidence of the changes brought about by just two
technological innovations: the telephone and the telegraph. The
editorial in itself is a revelation of how swiftly technological
innovations were accepted and incorporated into everyday life. As the
editorial stated, ``The railroad may have physically united Canada
but it was the telegraph that literally called the nation into
being.''
</EM>
<p>
The first transmission of a message by telegraph was made
in 1846 -- which triggered a mad scramble to ``wire'' the
whole nation. This was a message transmitted from Hamilton to Toronto
-- such a short distance compared to the transmission of
information via satellite today!!
<p>
Leafing through the pages of the magazine is like taking a walk
through history of the technological progression that has occurred on
this Continent. As stated above, the first telegraph message was sent
in 1846 between Hamilton and Toronto. In 1858 the first transatlantic
cable was laid from Valentia Bay, Ireland to Trinity Bay,
Newfoundland. Alexander Graham Bell designed the telephone at
Brantford, Ont., in 1874. In 1876 Bell made the world's first
long-distance calls between Ontario communities of Mount Pleasant,
Brantford and Paris.
<p>
The anniversary issue of the magazine is replete with pictures of the
early beginnings of the so-called ``information revolution''
that we are witnessing today: One photo shows a row of approximately
15 to 20 couriers on bicycles ready to take off carrying messages
outside a Montreal office (1920). Another picture shows a row of
telephone operators, ``centrals'' as they were called: ``In
1907 when 21 women operated the Vancouver central switchboard for a
population of 65,000, a private telephone line cost $1.00 a month.
Customers called ``central'' by turning a handle, operators then
connected them to their number.''
<p>
The telephone and telegraph were accepted with great
speed -- quoting one segment of the text, ``Telephones were all
the rage in Canada in the early 20th century, which meant much
employment for workers who erected the wires and poles needed to
accommodate an ever-burgeoning demand. In the one-year period
of 1912 alone, the number of Canadians with phones grew by about 19
percent by 1913. When the population was 7.5 million, one in 16
Canadians had the newfangled device.'' This text was accompanied by
a photograph of the method used at that time to erect a telephone pole
-- between twenty and thirty men were involved in raising the huge
pole.
<p>
Yes, in the beginning, the growth of technology did indeed create
employment. By contrast, how are poles erected today? Huge cranes
powered by extraneous energy do the work of a multitude of men, with
just one operating the controls in a comfortable cab. The text of two
photographs reveals the very essence of ``technological
progression'': ``Each strand of a fibre optic cable can transmit
from Toronto to Vancouver in one-tenth of a second -- the
equivalent of the information in a 32-volume encyclopedia. By
contrast, two intertwined threads of spaghetti-like copper wire,
held by a technician with the Saquenay-Quebec Telephone Company in
1948, could transmit a maximum of just 12 conversations
simultaneously.
<p>
A few words of explanation in regard to ``fibre optics.''
According to the text: ``Canada's first coast-to-coast
fibre optic cable -- the world's longest -- was completed on
March 13, 1990, by Stentor -- an alliance of the country's major
telephone companies. Last summer, Stentor finished a parallel
back-up line: every 400 kilometres, a cross-link-rung of
high-performance fibre cable joins the two lines so that if one
breaks, data is automatically rerouted to the other without any loss
of service. Thus continues a long tradition of cross-Canada
cabling that began with the telegraph.
<p>
``Fibre optic cable is made of fine strands of glass along which
information is transmitted, using pulses of light. A fibre the
thickness of a human hair can deliver 32,000 simultaneous
conversations, or 1,000 billion bits per second, of audio, video or
data signals.''
<p>
In 1880, the Niagara Falls telephone convention adopted
``hello'' as the standard salutation. The first telegraph line
across Canada was laid along-side the Canadian Pacific Railway in
1885. Samuel Morse had invented the electric telegraph in 1844 --
dots and dashes of this code became universal and it signaled a new
age in meteorology, among other things. And - in 1890, Sir Sanford
Fleming standardized time zones which were accepted around the world.
Up until that time, there had been no need for such notions. Prior to
the invention of the telegraph, news could only travel as fast as a
human on horseback could carry it. Before Samuel Morse invented his
message machine, transportation was only as fast as a human could
travel. Suddenly, with the Morse code, word could be transmitted
instantly! Distance was no longer a major problem.
<p>
But the social implications of the development of the telegraph was
not recognized for the dynamic influence it really was -- not any
more than any other technological invention before that, or since. But
the social fabric of the hand-tool, hand-toil age was doomed.
<p>
Interspersed with the text about the ``wiring'' of Canada, are
pictures of the workers stringing wires of the telephone and telegraph
-- even one of a park warden using his horse as a ladder to
``repair'' a broken telegraph wire attached to a tree. This was
part of the added duties of the park wardens out in the wilds of
Canada at that time -- not only looking out for fires, but keeping
an eye on the slender wire of communication.
<p>
The phrase ``history repeats itself'' can very well apply to the
feverish activity regarding the ``Internet.'' In the early days
of the telephone and telegraph, many companies were formed, each one
vying for customers. Time revealed this to be an inefficient way to
communicate. Eventually the small individual telephone and telegraph
companies were bought up and consolidated into trans-Canadian
enterprises. So too, did the ``Morse Code'' become obsolete in
the wake of ``wireless'' transmission of the radio, etc.
<p>
The computerization of the entire Continent is developing at a
breakneck speed. Just about every publication carries articles on the
``Internet'' with various opinions of observations by pundits
and others. A whole new language has evolved with the evolution of the
computers. Dictionaries are now available that are as thick as
Webster's, with words that Webster never heard of. All evolved from
the electronic revolution we are witnessing. Every business, be it
doctors' offices, groceries, gas stations, schools, restaurants,
retail shops, airlines, hospitals with a computer in every patient
room, and any other endeavor you want to name, is computerized --
because they have to be.
<p>
Howard Scott, the founder of Technocracy, stated, many years ago, that
the public would be dragged kicking and screaming into the new world
of technology. We are witnessing that today. Social change has taken
place, but the human animal, being a creature of habit, is still
clinging desperately to the same old concepts of yesterday. There is
no turning back, and how we survive in the next few years will depend
on how well we understand what is happening to our world.
<p>
The North American Continent is the logical leader of the coming age.
It is the only area that has the physical components to establish a
social system that will be in complete harmony with the new age of
technology.
