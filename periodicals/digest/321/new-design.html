<EM>The North American Continent needs every citizen
possible to study and understand the grave conditions -- social,
economic and environmental -- now present on this Continent, and
elsewhere.
</EM>
<p>
Most likely you will, if, and as, your study continues,
find that you increasingly will be able to answer many of the
questions you have asked yourself for years. Many Technocrats have
found this to be so in their own experience.
<p>
Solutions to North America's major social problems have been available
for more than 60 years, and all citizens who could read should have
been made aware of Technocracy's solutions long ago. The fact that
they haven't can only be due to the planned failure of the news media
and the educational system to present this knowledge. They have
certainly been supplied with this information.
<p>
To anticipate an often-asked question, the probable time of a
transition from this Price System to a Technate is unanswerable at
this time. Although Technocracy has been surprisingly accurate in its
predictions, this one is so riddled with variables that a prediction
can not even be attempted. The answer depends, for example, on the
intelligence available, how much the public is willing to suffer, how
long information can be withheld, and, of course, how successful
Technocrats are in overcoming the silence of the news media in
informing our fellow citizens concerning this subject.
<p>
We can point out, however, that the U.S. federal debt is now $5.0
trillion, and increasing at about a quarter of a trillion per year.
<p>
We can point out that more than 38 million Americans
are living in poverty, with at least another 38 million only slightly
better off.
<p>
We can point out that Canada's condition is quite
similar.
<P>
We can point out that more people, including
newspaper columnists, ecologists, and the general public are being
forced, by the march of events, to admit that, more than ever before,
something is not working properly since the great depression of the
1930s.
<p>
We can also point out that, with a population
increase of nearly 100 million per year, and with the resulting
decline in natural resources, plus the increasing pollution of the
environment, the human species have a limited time available to
reverse these trends. If it is not done soon, a point of no return
will be passed. Then, the best that can be done will be an effort to
postpone an ecological collapse, with no solution possible. Some
ecologists say this time limit will last only through the 1990s.
<p>
Another anticipated question: ``How well are we prepared to
initiate solutions?'' Not well. However, I must say that
Technocracy is not going to ``Take Charge.'' The solutions
required must be the result of pressure from the public, either as a
result of knowing what is necessary and how to do it, or as a demand
that solutions offered by the methods of science be effected. It could
be started in either the United States or Canada, but it will have to
be done, because there is no alternative for survival. We do not know
that a Technate will ever be installed, any more than we know that the
human species can survive the collapse of the present Price System
economy, or the collapse of the physical environment.
<p>
North American citizens are certainly not prepared to make any major
social change. Our ``leadership'' is not prepared, so how could
they prepare us? However all major new ideas have started from a very
few, and possibly only one human brain, and it must become widespread
from there. The time limits now being so short further limits the
possibilities. However, we think we have a chance, and since we know
that we haven't a choice, what can we do but try?
