<BLOCKQUOTE>Many people are concerned, or should be, with methods
of transition from today's antiquated Price System into an intelligent
society, in which all North Americans can share in the plentiful
production of a highly technological age.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
<EM>The physical transition is quite simple since we
already have the technology, the natural resources, and the trained
personnel to produce plenty for every North American citizen. All that
is necessary is to produce that plenty, then distribute it to all of
the Continent's citizens. What else is necessary? This is a physical
operation which can be done at any time we are willing to remove the
existing interference from the process. Any political or economic
system which can't allow this has become antiquated in today's
technological age.
</EM>
<p>
The only major problem we have yet to overcome is the
<EM>mental transition</EM> required to allow ourselves to use the
plenty we can already produce.  Once this is accomplished, it
shouldn't be difficult to work out such minor details as: reducing
working hours to less than one-half of that now considered normal,
so that everyone may have the pleasure of participating in the
operations of the first intelligent society on earth.
<p>
Unfortunately, this <EM>mental transition</EM> is
difficult, in view of all the misinformation and economic
superstitions which have been drilled into our heads since birth. We
have a social background, dating back an unknown number of centuries,
in which technology was not a factor to be considered, for the simple
reason that it didn't exist. The traditions developed slowly, and have
been taught to each new generation as they came on the scene. These
customs haven't evolved as rapidly as necessary to keep pace with our
scientifically developed technological mechanism, and, as a result,
the difference in this ever-widening gap is tearing our social
fabric into shreds. The increasing debt, crime, politics, poverty,
underemployment, etc. are rapidly proving the point.
<p>In the past, the idea of producing enough for
everyone was considered impossible. Now that technology HAS made it
possible, we find it quite difficult to believe it, or to understand
the social consequences. In the past, only a few could have plenty,
and then, only by taking more than a ``fair share'' from others
who then must do without. This created a long-standing custom of
socially un-cooperative behavior patterns which still interfere
with our understanding of the new conditions. Technology has made an
entirely new world for us to live in. As that physical world continues
to change, it exerts an ever-increasing pressure to update the
customs designed for the old conditions.
<p>
<HR><BLOCKQUOTE>
Technology has made an entirely new world for us to live in.
</BLOCKQUOTE><HR>
<p>
There may be any number of methods to encourage that mental
transition, depending on conditions that exist at the time the last
leg of the journey can no longer be delayed. Technology has already
made these major changes necessary, and it may also make them less
difficult to accomplish. We might consider some possibilities here:
<p>
<h3>First:  Consider  some  incentives  for  change:</h3>
<p>
We already have 35 million Americans trying to live
on Social Security; we have 38 million living in poverty; more than a
million in jails across the country; we have about a fifth of the
labor force who are underemployed; several million who have given up
trying to find income-producing jobs. As our technological
efficiency continues to increase, these numbers will also increase. We
have here an increasing number of millions who must be supported
financially by a decreasing percentage of the working labor force.
Note also that Canada and Mexico are in similar conditions.
<p>
<STRONG>Second:</STRONG> Consider what technology
is, even now, in process of achieving: A ``Smart Card'' with an
embedded ``chip'' which can not only supply the condition of
one's bank account, but, more importantly, can also provide much
information, such as that needed to determine what is purchased,
where, when, and in what quantities. The computer system involved here
can supply this information to the manufacturing computer which
controls the production process required to manufacture and ship to
the point of ``sale'' to replenish the stock. Further, all this
can be done without human hands. The significant point here is that
this equipment can work just as well whether one has a bank account or
not. This should be quite interesting to those who would like to live
in a free country.
<p>
<HR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<EM>An age of peace and plenty is now possible</em>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<p>
Now, add these two possibilities together -- the
incentive, and the physical means -- and one can see that an age of
peace and plenty is now possible. The age of controlling people by
financial pressure is being relegated to the museum of un-natural
history. The people now controlled by money can give all of it to
those who have been so successful in taking from others, and the
balance of us can use a better way.
<p>
The above would be an easy, and far less dangerous, method for getting
from here to there. Only human concepts of debt and tradition stand in
the way. Unfortunately, it is quite probable that many more
difficulties will be encountered, due to human cussedness and
stupidity in a non-cooperative world in which little knowledge
concerning the social effects of a technological age has been allowed
in educational institutions, or the news media. Rather than the easy
way, North Americans will quite likely do nothing, continuing to allow
themselves to be deceived, and defrauded, of the plenty our technology
has been able to produce for more than a half century. Their apathy
will cause them to wait for a major depression to jolt them from the
life-long rut they are in the habit of enduring. Then, in
desperation, they will jump on the first available bandwagon and chase
off in all directions at the same time. Does this sound cynical? Then
just take a look at the record.
<p>
<HR><BLOCKQUOTE>
Must it require a major depression to encourage serious
thought?
</BLOCKQUOTE><HR>
<p>
A majority of people, and probably much less than a
majority, can do anything they please, if it is physically possible,
if they cooperate, if they know what they are doing, and if all go in
the same direction at the same time. Further, they can do it without a
violent revolution. Must it require a major depression to encourage
serious thought?  Must it require a financial debacle worse than the
Savings and Loan collapse of a few years back? Must the present 38
million Americans now living in poverty be doubled in numbers? What
will it take to inspire a person to think?
<p>
We have enjoyed the benefits of the increasing
ability to produce, to this point, but the ability of past economic
and political methods are being strained to the breaking point in an
attempt to keep up with the rapidly-increasing ability of
technology to produce, with an ever-declining number of
man-hours per unit of production. Our present technology, running
full blast, can overflow the warehouses in a few weeks.
<p>It has become entirely too expensive for the
government to buy up the so-called surplus on such a large scale,
plus making unemployment and welfare payments.
<p>
The $5 trillion federal debt can't be paid off, and the interest
payments have become the second highest of all government expenses.
What is the highest? It just happens to be the total of all the
entitlement programs which are the result of the ``system''
being unable to distribute sufficient purchasing power to keep itself
in operation.
<p>
Cooperation and knowledge are the keys to success and it may be
expected from those who have the intelligence to understand
Technocracy's Technological Social Design. These are the people who
must accept the responsibility for what this ability requires of them.
Cooperation! This is our starting point right now. Regardless of the
particular method chosen for the last leg of the journey toward an
intelligent society, cooperation is essential, and the time to start
that phase is the day before yesterday.
