<EM>What does the word `education' mean to you?</EM>
<p>
A modern definition of education would include: `the development of
the human being to such an extent and in such a way that it can grasp
and cope with social change as it occurs, rather than rebel against
it' (as we are doing today). We will have to adopt this concept
because technology is forcing social change so fast that conventional
education is entirely inadequate for the coming generations.
<p>
<h3>People Resist Change</h3>
<p>
Education has had to surmount immense obstacles in
its growth through the centuries, the hardest one of all being humans'
resistance to change, good or bad; and only the force of circumstances
will make them adopt or discard it. About the only thing that has kept
resistance to change from winning out completely has been our
curiosity, and even that has been effectively stifled at times by
another all-too-efficient obstacle -- superstition.
<p>
Teachers and leaders of Galileo's day were teaching
Aristotle's theory of gravitation -- that a ten-pound weight
would fall ten times as fast as a one-pound weight. Galileo
refuted this statement and demonstrated his point successfully from
the top of the Leaning Tower of Pisa. Despite the physical proof of
his argument, he was scorned by the learned men of the time; they
continued to believe -- and teach -- what they wanted to
believe. But, you'll say, that was a long time ago; it could not
happen now. How wrong you would be! The enforced ignorance of the
actual law of gravity is in no way different from the enforced
ignorance of imminent social change that is perpetrated today.
<p>
Another obstacle in the path of education has been our economic
system. As demand for education grew, it attracted the attention of
big business, and the very nature of the business system is such that
any new process must show a profit; so, the school systems of the
U.S.A. and Canada became a `billion dollar' concern. Big business is
not concerned with the lack of facilities, accommodations and
educators that exist; it is concerned only with how much profit can be
squeezed out of the sequence of education.
<p>
Not only is our education inadequate; much of what we
do have is practically useless today. Of what functional use to
society are the time and the energy spent in the study of banking,
insurance, and stock manipulation?
<p>
One of the most gratifying trends observable today is
the thirst for knowledge, evidenced by the large attendance at evening
classes and night schools. Some students and adults realize their need
for increased education and welcome this opportunity to learn. Another
trend, not so gratifying, that is in growing evidence today, is that
toward commercialization in our public schools. For example, a Credit
Union is donating a large sum of money to a school district to teach
children about money. ``Students are given the opportunity to
dream,'' says their Career Development Coordinator. ``Then they
face reality.'' No mention is made of the `tough reality' students
face today because of the interference of money.
<p>
The press, radio, and TV are means that could be used
to great advantage in education, but are they so used? The whole
educational effort of these media is expended on boosting our present
way of life, presenting programs that attempt to blind our eyes to
what we could have. It is true that they do publish and show a few
controversial and informative ideas, but there is never any mention of
a solution to problems; the reader and viewer are just left with the
idea that ``this is the way it is, and nothing can be done about
it'', mostly because it is too costly.
<p>
Naturally, these avenues of education are closed to
any idea or program which is contrary to the status quo. Witness the
way the columns of the press were closed to Technocracy overnight, and
across the Continent simultaneously, as soon as it was discovered that
Technocracy was not going to allow itself to be exploited by the big
fellows in the business world. Of course, television, owned and
operated by the same propaganda machines, follow this trend today.
<p>
Despite the above, there is evidence galore of
widespread recognition of the fact that our children's future, and the
entire social structure, are threatened by the lack, not only of basic
schooling, but also of the advanced education which is essential to a
high-energy civilization.
<p>
<h3>A Positive Education</h3>
<p>
Technocracy's whole program is educational, but
because it does not follow the orthodox pattern, its Organization is
restricted to only those means of education that it can provide
through its own facilities for publication and other methods of
dissemination. But, though these are limited, yet it is presenting a
program of positive education that can be found nowhere else.
<p>
Technocracy is presenting to the people of North America a program
which will achieve not only a much higher standard of health and
general welfare, but also an educational standard that will allow
every child born on this Continent to have all the formal education
they can absorb, plus every conceivable opportunity to develop
themselves physically, artistically, and mentally, to their utmost
capacity. Furthermore, when the Technate is achieved, every citizen
will have full opportunity to make use of, and enjoy, the education
they have acquired, since they will not be obliged continually to keep
their `noses to the grindstone' just in order to live.
<p>
See the Difference Between the Occasional Bus Trips
In the Price System School Set-up, and What Technocracy Envisaged
Education Would Be Like In A Technate
<p>
In the Technate, schooling will not be a matter of
merely sitting in classrooms and acquiring knowledge, second-hand,
from textbooks. Students will be introduced to fine arts and music,
and their talents encouraged along this line. They will have sports
training, if this is their inclination.  It will be a vital, living
process of learning through seeing and experiencing, as well as
reading about the facts of life.
<p>
In their own local areas, they will become
acquainted, not only with the geography, but also with the various
fundamental processes of production and distribution of the products
they use in their everyday living.
<p>
As they grow older, they will go further afield,
until, by the time they are old enough to choose their line of work,
they will have first-hand knowledge of all the various elements
entering into the production and distribution of goods and services
throughout the entire Continent. From then on, their training will be
specialized to fit them for their chosen fields, and when they have
reached the age of twenty-five, they will be prepared to step into
the function for which they are trained. If they still want further
education it will be available, and there will be plenty of time for
it, and there will be an opportunity to live `the good life' which
such conditions will, for the first time, make available to the entire
population.
<p>
<h3>Travelling Classrooms</h3>
<p>
Perhaps you are thinking that the cost of this type
of `travelling education' would be prohibitive. In the Price System,
of course, it is out of the question, except for the small percentage
of the well-to-do, but in the Technate, with all the various
operational sequences coordinated and cooperating to that end, it will
be entirely feasible. Every individual will have ample consuming
privileges, no matter where they may be located; transportation
facilities will be arranged to accommodate shifting groups of
school-age people. Their transportation, and also travelling
classroom and dormitory facilities, will probably be tied in with the
movement of slow freight via marine trains on the inter-connected
waterways of the new Continental Hydrology system. Since speed would
not be important, the many thousands of marine trains could be
designed and constructed so as to carry classrooms and dormitories on
their top decks. Thus the various class units, with their own
teachers, could be carried all over the Continent on extended
schedules, going north, south, east and west, and taking time for
side-trips to interesting or important points. The intriguing
possibilities of such a system stagger the imagination, yet they are
entirely practicable. But it is a job for engineers, not politicians.
<p>
Under such an educational system the country stands
to gain immeasurably by making available the fully developed talents
of vast numbers of children who, under the self-vaunted free
enterprise system, would never have a chance, even to find out what
they are capable of doing, because of the interference of the
ever-present price tag. And it is safe to predict that, when that
time comes, the problem of `juvenile delinquency' will simply
disappear, to be recalled only as a disagreeable nightmare among the
other nightmares of the Price System days.
<p>
The installation of Technocracy's design of education
does not call for the importation of anything at all from any other
country. It requires merely a redesigning of factors and facilities
already at hand, on a scientific basis, and their extension, to
provide every boy and girl on the North American Continent a kind, and
degree, of education never before possible in the world -- an
education on which to build a life worth living.
