<h3>The Effect Of Downsizing On Society </h3>
<p>
Now that downsizing has become a household word, and now that everyone
knows that the word itself simply means ``you're fired'' what
are the results of such vast unemployment?
<p>
In times past, a layoff from a job was usually because of a slowdown
in business or a break-down of equipment, or any one of a number
of reasons which could change in time and the laid-off worker be
recalled to the job.
<P>
But not now. Downsizing means that the jobs no longer
exist. The workers have been replaced by machines, which do the work
and produce a saleable item much more efficiently than can human
workers. Therefore, the owners can sell the product at a much lower
price and, by so doing, increase the volume of sales and make a
greater profit for those owners.
<p>
But here we run into a problem which is unsolvable as
long as we operate under the archaic price system which has prevailed
for centuries, and which did work after a fashion as long as human and
animal labor formed the basis of our economy.
<p>
Boiled down, it simply meant that a few people in control of land and
other natural resources could build up fortunes while those who
labored for them could do little more than make a living.
<p>
But now -- now in the last years of the twentieth century -- we
are coming into a new age, an age which must deal with the fact that
there cannot be such a thing as gainful employment for many thousands
of workers who need paychecks in order to survive.
<p>
Downsizing is inescapable. Just as the McCormick
reaper replaced laborers swinging old fashioned scythes, or cradles as
they were then called, so modern technology has replaced
assembly-line workers in all types of industrial production.
<p>
Now we face another fact: even if the operators produce goods at a
very much lower manufacturing cost due to modern technology, to whom
will they sell these products? Certainly not to unemployed workers.
<p>
So what must these workers do in order to live -- to feed their
families, to make mortgage payments, keep up insurance, and pay the
costs of educating their children?
<p>
The above problems cannot -- repeat -- cannot be solved under
the price system.
<p>
Even in the best of times in the past we could never have full
employment, so how can we think of such a condition now?
<p>
In the past, and to a much greater extent now, there have been, and
are, people who state that each invention, each forward step into the
technological age, provides more jobs and adds to employment.
<p>
We have little to say to such people, and will bid them goodbye now
for they are not looking at our present dilemma with an unprejudiced
eye. Perhaps they can't; they may not have the intelligence to look
facts in the face.
<p>
The problems facing us, not just in the future, but
right now, are too great to be solved by politicians. We do not
hesitate to say that our present so-called democratic system must
be exchanged for one in which goods and services, all of them, are
produced and distributed in a scientific manner, a system in which
each human is entitled to the necessities of life regardless of the
amount in which he contributed to the system.
<p>
As we go further into the downsizing now in progress the problem
becomes more profound. So what happens if we continue as we are?
<p>
There comes a time when taxpayers cannot pay into the
system enough money to pay for social security, medicare, employment
insurance and the many other expenditures we make in our efforts to
keep the Price System going. What then must follow?

<h3>Are you ready? Then here it is:</h3>
<p>
Chaos follows, the breakdown of law and order, for
starving people will rob and even kill for food. There will be riots
in the streets of our cities. We have already seen what can happen
when small groups arm themselves and decide that they are preparing
for war with our federal government.
<p>
The best book available at this time concerning the downsizing problem
is one written by Jeremy Rifkin. The book is called
<cite>The End of Work.</cite>
The author spoke on television (Station C-SPAN April 2, 1996). He
highlighted some of the problems which exist as a result of modern
technology. However, he didn't seem to have any idea of how we can
solve unemployment problems.
<p>
He suggested that we might have to go to a
25-hour work week, thus sharing the work among more employees.
What follows then? Shall we go to a 20-hour week? -- a
10-hour week? It is obvious that this sharing the employment by
shortening the hours will not work. Rifkin quotes many people,
politicians, labor leaders and others who advocate this method. Even
that philosophical genius, England's Bertrand Russell, was quoted as
saying, ``There should not be eight hours per day for some and zero
for others but four hours per day for all.''
<p>
There will, of course, always be a need for human labor as far as
repairing the damage done by a hurricane or some other natural
disaster, but there will be little or no need for such employment as
assembly-line work in manufacturing, for today's technology has
created machines that do all this work. These machines appear to be
able to think, guided as they are by computers.
<p>
An article, ``No Help Wanted,'' was printed in the May 1993
issue of Playboy magazine. The article, by Charles A. Carami, said
that technology soon will have taken over practically all factory
work, and that the greatest status symbol of the 21st century will be
for anyone who has a job.
<p>
What happens to workers who have been fired, laid
off, or, if we want to use the modern term -- downsized?
<p>
Some of them send out resum&#233s to companies in the
line of work with which they had past experience. Probably some of
them find new jobs, but most do not. Some seek work of any nature just
so there is a paycheck with it.
<p>
After savings are used up, unemployment insurance has run out, and no
job has been found, what then? It is a problem that each downsized
person must face. Some go on welfare as the last means of providing
food and lodging.
<p>
It is a shame and worse than a disgrace that this situation exists in
America, the richest country in the world.
<p>
<HR><BLOCKQUOTE>
Living conditions can only get worse as we struggle with our
Price System.
</BLOCKQUOTE><HR>
<p>
Technology has smashed the Price System, and it is up to us to adopt a
new way of producing and distributing goods and services.
<p>
For over 60 years Technocracy Inc. has shown that it was only a matter
of time until the present critical situation arose. Now it is here.
<p>
Up to recently we have seen the industrial downsizing of workers. A
much greater impact will be felt with the automation of service
industries -- banking, supermarkets, gas stations, to mention only
three.
<p>
We cannot adapt to this new technological age if we
continue with the old wornout price system -- using money as a
means of exchange, expecting that there will be enough demand for
human labor to furnish employment for an ever--growing population.
<p>
We must change to the scientific method in the
production and distribution of goods and services, by which means each
human will be assured of the necessities of life from the cradle to
the grave.
<p>
We do not have a choice in this matter. We do have a chance for
survival. It is up to us to make the change that can guarantee that
survival.
