<BLOCKQUOTE>For Many Years Technocracy has warned the people of
North America that the arrogant disregard for basic social and
physical trends by the front men for the North American Price System,
would jeopardize the security and welfare of North America.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
<EM>We are in the midst of a great technological
revolution which is forcing a complete change of our social system.
Handled properly, this could be the emancipation of all the people on
this Continent, and could also influence the social structures of the
rest of the world. However, the mismanagement of this science and
technology -- which we have been witnessing as these scientific
achievements have advanced -- will end only in disaster. So --
we have to decide which course we want to follow. The only way we can
do that is to join together and install a completely different social
system. Technocracy suggests a Technological Social Design which is
synchronized to handle this new technology.
</EM>
<p>
About 75 years ago, Howard Scott, Director-in-Chief of
Technocracy Inc., was interviewed by Charles H. Wood, Associate Editor
of The New York World, on the subject of the social effects and
importance of technology on this Continent. During that interview, on
February 26, 1921, Mr. Scott outlined the key to the unique social
problem before North America. The Technical Alliance, of which Mr.
Scott was the Director, was composed of leading technical personnel of
North America, and had, by 1921, developed a clear technological
perspective of social and physical trends in this civilization. Mr.
Scott's technological views of social affairs astonished Mr. Wood; for
example, that North America's problem was really an engineering
problem, not a political or financial one. Such astonishment was not
justified by the facts that were available even 75 years ago; it was
the measure of how far ahead of social thought Technocracy has always
been in its view of social affairs. Time and events have vindicated
Technocracy's position and original statements.
<p>
Technocracy Inc., since its inception as a Field
Organization, formed to carry on the research-educational program
that was begun in the winter of 1918-19, has continued to convey
an accurate picture of developing trends affecting this Continent.
More than that, Technocracy Inc. has given the people of North America
the organizing vehicle to do something about their problem.
<p>
The central problem before North America is the conflict between
science (and the requirement of scientific social operation) and the
obsolete methods of the Price System. At an incalculable cost, which
is only now becoming apparent, politics and business and wars have
kept the Price System afloat for the past 60 years -- years in
which a new social system should have been born and flourishing. The
measures which have been taken, in the framework of the Price System,
to prevent the arrival of a technological social control in North
America, constitute the worst example in recorded history of
calculated sabotage against a social area. At no time in history has
so much been at stake for so many people.
<p>
A succession of arms programs and wars, which have
proved useless, and were declared so by Technocracy before we became
involved in them, gave temporary relief from the Depression. These
moves to preserve the Price System have kept people fat, dumb, and
happy for the past many years. And though many of them knew better,
today they are not above pleading ignorance. At any rate, all of us
now are reaping the fruits of Price System sabotage and the social
emergency that has been created.
<p>
<h3>Lack of Objective</h3>
<p>
Now that some of the arrogance has been knocked out
of us by current events on the international scene, some people are
giving pause to look at our social circumstances a little more
objectively than in recent years. Outstanding, is the total lack of a
national objective of any kind. There is no social unity, and little
national pride except in our bigness and in certain philosophic words,
phrases and ideas that no longer apply in this Age of Science. These
things aren't reason enough in a world that is moving as fast as this
one. The cult of individualism, which we think we believe in, but
which in fact we can't even practice, dominates the social attitude
required to survive and progress upward and forward in this scientific
era.
<p>
We are finding that it was most unfortunate to allow reactionary
minorities to intimidate and belittle those individuals who could
appreciate and work with science; and to make science almost a dirty
word to citizens of this Continent, especially to the youngsters. It
is too bad that the social consciousness of the average youth has been
influenced by a moronic level of education.
<p>
And among the older generations, it can't seem to be so smart any more
to have `sold out' to the Price System in an attempt to amass a few
pieces of shoddy goods and an inferior dwelling, most of which aren't
paid for now and probably won't ever be paid for in full. All of those
hours in a semi-stupor before the television set don't seem to
have been wisely spent, either. The past critical years have been
marked by a succession of mistakes -- individual and national. They
add up to an extremely high social price for this Continent. It's
pretty hard to pin the responsibility for the sabotage of this
civilization on any particular group of individuals. Too many people
have welcomed it, and participated in it.
<p>
<h3>A Scientific Interest</h3>
<p>
We, of North America, are about as disorganized for
any social objective as we can be and, furthermore, we are without any
evident desire to get organized. Technocracy, for years, has been
addressing, with telling effect, only a minority of the citizens of
this Continent. We are just beginning to emerge from a period of years
when it didn't make the slightest difference to more than
ninety-five percent of the population how correct an analysis one
might present; people weren't interested. Nevertheless, Technocracy
Inc. has built and maintained, under the most difficult conditions for
its type of thought, a nucleus of personnel to whom nothing that is
occurring on the North American scene is a surprise. What some people
are now becoming alarmed about is `old stuff' to Technocracy and
Technocrats.
<p>
<h3>Arrogant Disregard</h3>
<p>
Collectively, North Americans have looked upon their
great land area, which they have regarded as their birth-right,
only as a wonderful opportunity to exploit for their personal benefit.
This idea has been hammered into them by the educational system,
politics, business, and numberless other sources, from the time they
were first able to read and understand words. For a time this
Continent was able to tolerate such a social attitude, despite the
damage that it inflicted upon natural resources. A loose political
control favored and rewarded the most adept chiselers. Graced with a
great wealth of natural resources and an accommodating climate for the
white man, North America has fostered the growth of a mighty
industrial civilization, which grew at a tremendous rate with the
application of technology by technically trained personnel. <EM>The
rate of growth soon rendered obsolete, the social attitude and the
Price System of the Continent.</EM>
<p>
<EM>But that occurrence has not stopped us from continuing to use
the old system. Therein lies the crucial conflict.  </EM>It is a
battle to the death for one or the other. No one can say with absolute
certainty what the final outcome will be. We do know that we live by
science and technology: therefore, the decision of each North American
had better be in favor of these social forces. Our utter failure, as a
people, to recognize the problem, and to act, is pushing us into much
worse social consequences to come, unless there is a widespread
revival of social consciousness.
<p>
Since the North American Continent is without a
governing mechanism that is capable of supplying the leadership and
direction required to guide us out of the present mess, the question
arises:
<p>
<h3>What can anyone else do about it?</h3>
<p>
At some point in time in the future, probably all too
soon, the mass of people on this Continent is going to be jolted into
action by the pressure of events. When this mass movement begins, it
had better be directed by an organization that knows the score. As
conditions become more intolerable, a social ferment will develop,
producing the mass movement which will be largely devoid of
intelligent understanding.
<p>
While Technocracy Inc. is not designed to be a governing mechanism,
Technocracy, the method, is so designed. Many people do not understand
this distinction. Technocrats are willing to help in installing this
new system, but it must be done in an orderly fashion, and enough
people would have to understand this, otherwise there would be
absolute chaos. People would have to demand a complete social change.
Technocracy's Technological Social Design would be the blueprint
followed. Once this Design was installed, the organization of
Technocracy Inc. would dissolve; it's job done.
<p>
When we consider that 75 years of engineering and scientific research*
have gone into Technocracy, we begin to
understand why it is qualified to discuss comprehensively, and with
the correct insight, problems before North America. What we are
attempting to make clear is that we North Americans have a course of
action to take to solve our problems. Technocracy is born of science;
it is being presented in an organized way; and its Organization has
the leadership to see us through social change on this Continent. What
more do we want?
