``For a long period of time, people knew what the
problem was: they didn't have enough of anything. They were having a
hard time to gain as much as they possibly could out of the scarcity
that was available. They knew what their problem was.
<p>
<h3>``But what's our problem today?''</h3>
<p>
``We're in a mess. We have unemployment. In San
Francisco it's estimated that there are 10,000 people who don't have a
bed to sleep in at night. They say New York and Los Angeles are much
worse. In San Francisco, a church that first feeds the hungry, clears
away the tables, then allows people to sleep there, but must still
turn away hundreds.
<p>
<h3>``That's the situation we're in. Why? Are you
concerned? Are we concerned about it?</h3>
<p>
``Well, some of us are. We realize that something
fundamental has happened which has changed things. But most people
don't know why. Ask them on the street -- all they're interested in
is ``a job.'' They have been so conditioned that they think they
cannot have a place to sleep unless they work -- unless they have a
job. There isn't enough work to go around at the present time. Our
technology -- our new method of doing things -- has changed
things -- we no longer have a scarcity.
<p>
``Our businessmen are jockeying with each other trying to get
sales, to get rid of what they have. It's there, but they can't get
rid of it, because you have to have a monetary token to exchange for
what you need, and if you don't have a job and the money to pay for
the goods, the goods remain on the shelves.
<p>
``So we've become all confused. We've become conditioned to the
point where we have accepted the monetary exchange as the primary
objective of life.
<p>
``Everybody wants the almighty dollar. Wars are fought for it. It
has captivated us. Money is not wealth. But natural resources --
physical wealth -- that's the wealth that means something. Yet
money is acting as an interference at the present time to prevent us
from getting that which we are so capable of producing for our own
use. It's very pathetic, and it's reached a point where it's becoming
a very grave problem as far as our future is concerned.
<p>
What is happening to our land and economy?  We need
three trillion dollars to bring our cities up to date.
<p>
``Have you any conception of what a trillion
dollars is? When they first came out with billions, we didn't know
what a billion was, and we got some conception when somebody explained
that if you had saved a $1,000 a day from the birth of Christ until
the present time, you still wouldn't have a billion dollars.
<p>
``What's a trillion? The new budget brings the
national debt to something over a trillion dollars. For 100 million
taxpayers that's $10,000 per taxpayer on which we'll pay $1,000 per
year in interest. $1,000,000,000,000! If you started counting $100
bills at 100 per minute, 12 hours a day, you'd count only $26,000,280
in a year, so you'd have to keep it up for 4,000 years to reach a
trillion.
<p>
``Fantastic, isn't it? Here we are -- a people in the most
favorable spot that civilization has ever been in, as far as our
ability to produce and have those things that are necessary to make
life enjoyable, and yet we're so muddled, so confused. We want to
solve the problem, but we want to do so within the framework of what
we already have -- a Price System, and that's the interference with
which we're faced.
<p>
<h3>People want a change, but they don't want a change.</h3>
<p>
Oh yes, a lot of people out there want a change, but
they don't want a change. They want a change which will miraculously
make what we already have workable -- but it's not workable
anymore. It worked fine under conditions of scarcity, but today it
can't.
<p>
Economists have varied solutions. It is said that if
you got 100 economists in a room, they'd all agree that we're in
trouble, but every last one of them would have a different answer as a
solution. None of them can understand that the fundamental processes
of life have been changed -- changed by the introduction of
technology; changed by a new method of doing work.
<p>
That which works now is technology, and human beings
are being set aside, where they don't have to slave and toil as a
means of providing a livelihood. It's now being provided by
technology; we don't recognize that yet. We're still trying to wheedle
the human being into the scheme of things so that he continues to work
in order to provide a living.
<p>
<h3>You know, George Bernard Shaw said ``The Earth
is the lunatic asylum of the Universe!''</h3>
<p>
And these leaders of ours -- charlatans -- they don't know; they
don't understand; they're ignorant of the very processes that they're
trying to solve. They don't understand them, and as a result we have
the greatest hodge-podge of activities here, all of which conflict
with one another.
<p>
Who is it that's in trouble? The party that's on relief? The party
that's unemployed? Yes, they're in trouble. How about the old people,
who are on pensions?  They're afraid to do it now, with an election
looming, but these politicians got their hammer out to take some of
the pension plans apart and reduce them.
<p>
The country is in such bad shape, I mean, physically; the old cities
in the east -- the sewage systems are breaking up, the roads are in
bad condition; the bridges of the country -- a bridge collapses
every day somewhere in the United States. They're in bad shape. The
whole country is faced with a rebuilding, but they figure, what is it
going to cost? And they estimate it at $3 trillion; to bring it up to
standard. Now these things are happening. Where are we going to get
the money?
<p>
We have reached the point where our economy is faced with a shortage
of the materials that we need in the physical world. In other words,
we have squandered our inheritance. We have squandered it on wars; we
have produced war machines and equipment, in World War I and World War
II, and the Vietnam War. We squandered billions of tons of materials
in the destruction of war. Now we're short of some things. And so
they're beginning to talk about conservation. We've got to conserve
things -- we don't have them in abundance like we used to, so we've
got to be careful how we use them, and re-use them at all times.
And so they started out by asking people to save the materials --
save your newspapers.
<p>
We can't conserve under this set-up. The minute
you conserve, you hurt somebody. The minute you cut down on using
something, or using it over and over again, somebody gets unemployed.
Sales go down. That's what we're faced with.
<p>
I have something of interest here, just to show what I mean. We've got
a problem of over-population, not only here, but throughout the
world. In China, they want their people to have only one child; two at
the most -- to cut down on the production of humans, because
there's not enough space to provide for them, not enough material to
provide for them. Well, I have an index here on motherhood. Now, if
you were to have only one child, or two children, to cut down on the
over-population, it says here, here's what would happen. The
pregnancy tests by physicians would be reduced -- they'd have less
business. In home pregnancies, that test, E.P.T., would also suffer.
Obstetricians would suffer, they wouldn't have as much business as
they used to have. The people that make bassinets, they, too, would
suffer because people were not buying the number of bassinets that
they used to buy. Maternity clothes -- three outfits would be
eliminated for each baby that was not produced. Maternity stockings;
blankets, baby blankets; bottles, 8 bottles; crib; time off from work;
safety pins, two cards, four each; baby powder, baby clothes, pink or
blue outfit; caesarian procedure; cigars, one box. But this gives you
an idea. If you try to conserve, you ruin things.
<p>
We've got to continue to expand; we've got to buy
more; we've got to keep the wheels of industry going. Otherwise, it
gets in the reverse, and we're in trouble. And so, we can't face the
problem of conserving under our present mode of operation. Oh, I have
a few more things here -- the labor room, the baby sitter per hour,
baby formula, 8 bottles, disposable diapers, one case a month --
and so on it goes. I'm not taking time to read it all -- but it
gives you a general idea that you can't conserve -- this economy
that we live under is an economy of expansion and destruction. The
more you destroy, the shabbier the goods, the quicker the turnover,
the greater the profit. And that's what we're interested in --
we're interested in profits more than anything else.
<p>
Now, that's the condition of the country, so don't
feel too bad about your plight, because it's perhaps insignificant. At
least you can get on relief; at least you can get unemployment
insurance. But if these big fellows fail, you won't even be able to
get that, you see. They'll be in the same boat.
<p>
What did Shaw say? The earth is the lunatic asylum of the universe?
Intelligence? That's what we're supposed to have. And we're arming the
entire world -- the ``free world'' that is. We're sending off
our natural resources, and selling them, in the form of tanks,
airplanes and war materials.
<p>
<h3>Intelligence? That's our leaders? The Charlatans
and Fools that are guiding our destiny? Well, now, what about them?</h3>
<p>
Yes, charlatans and fools are shaping our destiny,
and we're allowing them to do so. What they hope to do, is to somehow,
miraculously, work this thing around so that we have an ``up''
as far as our economy is concerned. But we know, in a physical world,
that if anything goes up, pressure has to make it rise. It doesn't
rise by itself. It has to have the application of energy, to make it
rise.
<p>
Now, somebody said we've hit bottom. Yes, and we're going to lay on
the bottom until something comes along to make it rise. In the past to
bring it up they have used war and warfare, to bring about enough
demand to wholesale destruction of equipment, food, and so on.  We
don't have a war at the present time, but what are the prospects?
<p>
Those people who are guiding our destiny; those people who are
imperiling our very existence, are a very small minority. Now, what's
the matter with the majority, that allows their guidance of destiny to
go on? Let's think about it. We've got to inform people, and make them
aware of what is happening, because the entire population of the earth
can be wiped out; we have that ability in our own hands.
<p>
It's funny, isn't it. We have created robots that do the work, and
these robots have ``eyes.'' They can actually see; they know
just where to reach, and where to put their projected tool that they
want to accomplish a particular type of work -- they know exactly
where to put it. And so somebody got on the air, and he was talking
about robots, and he said, ``Robots make jobs;'' and somebody
said, ``Well, how?'' ``Well,'' he said, ``somebody has
to make the robots. People have to make the robots.'' And then when
you visit a factory where they make robots, who do you suppose is
making them? Other robots! So, you can't win, as far as the Price
System is concerned.
<p>
There is nothing wrong with our ability to produce, or with the
resources we have available. What we have is a mental problem.
Physically it doesn't exist but mentally, we members of the Earth
here, which is the lunatic asylum of the Universe -- we people are
creating our problem. We don't know what to do with the abundance that
we're capable of producing. We can't organize and work together.
<p>
In scarcity, you have to have competition, but where you have enough
of everything, you can't have competition. You have to have
co-operation. You have to work together, and provide for the
people as a whole -- not individually like you do in scarcity, but
people as a whole.
<p>
Now, we've reached that point, the point that people have been trying
to reach down through the ages, and at last we've arrived. Now, it's
going to get worse.
<p>
The thing that the politicians want to save more than anything else is
what they call the free world. And we can get a kick out of that --
if you believe there's any such thing as a free world, you'd better
have your head examined. What free world? The freedom of business
enterprise to take advantage of each other, and so on. They've got us
hoodwinked, and we just don't understand it.
<p>
The youth -- I'm surprised at the youth. Who was it, Bernard Shaw,
or who was it, said ``Youth is such a wonderful thing, it's too bad
to waste it on the young.'' It's too bad, because the youth --
in fact, everybody -- wants to go BACK to something.
If we could only get back to the days when things operated in a more
pleasant and a more profitable way.'' And they all want to go back;
nobody wants to go ahead. At last we have arrived, but now we want to
go back to the place that we struggled against in order to arrive. Oh,
it doesn't make any sense, believe me, it doesn't. And so that's the
way it is.
<p>
Technocracy offers a plan where people can join together and organize,
and outstrip the organization of our leaders at the present time, and
we could introduce a civilization that was never possible before in
all human history -- where we could synchronize our activity; where
we could work as one unit for the production and the distribution of
the things that people need; where  <EM>people</EM> would
become number one, not money; where the materials and the physical
wealth would be preserved for their benefit, not only for now, but for
future generations to come. If we use our intelligence we can do that.
<p>
It's never a great majority that leads; it's always been a small
minority that leads. But if we can organize the majority under proper
leadership, we can have perhaps the greatest production, the greatest
distribution, of all of the things that we have the ability to
produce.
<p>
Technocracy is an organization which has been for years studying this
outcome. We're not optimistic; we're realistic. We've been gathering
the facts, got our figures together; we know exactly what can be done
-- not through what we desire, that has nothing to do with it.
<p>
We take an objective view of the situation as we find it. An objective
view means, setting aside all of your prejudices, all of the things
that have influenced you -- setting them aside -- and looking at
the problem and accepting it as you find it.
<p>
Well, we've got a job cut out for us. And the thing that I'm
interested in right now, is finding those people that are within that
10% that are socially conscious, to get them interested in joining
with others that are socially conscious; so that we'll have a better
opportunity to get the job done of informing more and more people.
<p>
We're not trying to overthrow. We're not advocating it for people. We
know that if we arrive in the future in the state that we could arrive
in, it would have to be along the lines of intelligence.
<p>
Any disruption on any major scale will destroy the very thing that
gives us life -- that produces the things that we live on. And so
it's a case of facing reality.
<p>
I can't influence you. I can talk to you, but you're going to have to
make a decision yourself. I can't change you, but you can change
yourself. You can change your behaviour.
<p>
Now, if your country doesn't mean any more to you than you are
displaying today, then you are a detriment to your country and a
detriment to the future welfare of the people of this Continent. You
have a responsibility, but you're the one that's going to have to
exercise that responsibility. Nobody can do it for you. And if you
accept the challenge, we can have more excitement; we can get more joy
out of living, because we are working in a direction and accomplishing
something that was never possible before.
<p>
And what a challenge it is. Can you accept the challenge? If you can,
then let's band together, and get the job done. The possibilities were
never so great, and we are the ones that have to accept those
possibilities and take some part in organizing to get the job done
properly.
<hr>
-- <EM>The above contains excerpts from a
lecture in Vancouver given September 4, 1982, by a member of the
Technocracy Section in San Francisco. Now, it's fourteen years later,
and, as you can see, nothing much has changed  (except to get
worse.)  Are you convinced now that we need a social change? Our
solution is still as valid as it ever was. Why not join us in
insisting on this change?</EM>
