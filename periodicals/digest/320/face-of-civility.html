The interactions of the human animal are both complex and
diverse. We operate and interrelate on many different levels. The
persona that we present to others may vary greatly according to the
relationship we have with that particular individual. It may vary
according to sex, blood, or marital relationship. Age and education,
as well as social standing, may also play a significant role in our
conduct toward others, as may perceptions of identifying
characteristics such as race, religion, language, and nationality.
Physically identifying characteristics are strong motivators of
conduct. Physical disfigurement can evoke preconceived notions of
worth and competence, as can differences in both style and quality of
clothing. Preferences in food and drink, both in type and quantity, as
well as preparation, can bring out latent animosities and prejudices,
as well as feelings of comfort and security.
<p>
But even well conditioned responses to familiar stimuli can change
under pressure and stress. One's view of the world and all its glory
may be extremely positive under one set of conditions, but may quickly
become negative given another set of circumstances. While consistent
wild swings of mood may be accurately diagnosed as
manic-depressive and treated quite successfully, less obvious
milder swings may not only be difficult to treat, but just as
difficult to diagnose. This internal change in response to changes in
external conditions is often observed in our daily interaction with
our fellow citizens. Thus the civility and courtesy that is a
necessary part of social peace and harmony, is dependent upon the
circumstances that affect our quality of life. The complex
psychological makeup of each individual will be reflected in the
manner in which he or she reacts to the circumstances particular to
that moment.
<p>
Each day brings more understanding of the human
brain, and the inter-relationship of its intricate and complex
structure. Pre-set genetic conditions may cause certain types of
behaviour and patterns of thinking. This is more probable than
previously thought. However, the conditioning brought about by all
types of social interaction still seems to have the most significant
impact on how we relate to others, and in an evermore populated and
crowded world, this is of major importance.
<p>
From the first days following birth, each individual is subject to an
environment that is particular to them. How rich or poor, both in
terms of physical and emotional context, is of paramount importance.
It has been conclusively shown that an early environment rich in
language, colour, emotional support and, most importantly, proper
nourishment, is conducive to a more active and confident child, better
able to take advantage of the opportunities for learning that are
presented both at that time, and even during later intellectual
growth. It is therefore imperative that maximum effort be expended to
ensure that the correct conditions are provided.
<p>
That we are sadly lacking in providing this proper
environment to a large segment of both our pre-school and junior
school children, is evident to anyone dealing with the problem. The
losses to society that result from this deprivation can only be
speculated, both in the creativity that may be stunted, as well as in
the anti-social behaviour that can result in destructive
activities.
<p>
Recent studies have shown that it is quite possible
that we cannot make up for these early childhood deprivations. If this
is indeed the case, how long are we going to put up with this loss to
society? How much longer are we going to be wedded to a system that
cannot put into practice the solutions to problems that we continue to
identify? What good is knowledge, if it is not used to ensure that
problems that are readily apparent are resolved? How much longer are
we going to allow this debt-loaded social operation to continue to
dictate the psychology of scarcity in the midst of abundance.
<p>
The lack of sufficient nourishment is not caused by a
corresponding lack of food, but rather is the result of a lack of will
of the populace to ensure the proper distribution of our abundant food
supply. The varying social, intellectual, and emotional conditions are
the result of a social system riddled with inequities, and can be
minimized through the provision of optimum housing, and the removal of
stress caused by these uncertainties and discrepancies of our failing
monetary system.
<p>
Similarly, a redesign of our overworked and antiquated educational
system, to one more oriented to ensuring that the latent abilities of
every individual be allowed to come to full fruition, will bring about
a renaissance in human endeavour in all of its aspects. Science and
the arts will flourish as never before, as the potential in all
citizens will finally be tapped, not just those of a favored few.
<p>
We can move into the future today, if we utilize the
knowledge that is compounding daily. Technocracy has been the only
organization to accurately analyze the operating characteristics of
our social operation and to design the necessary functional control to
ensure that we can have both and maintain a high standard of living
for every North American citizen. If you truly wish to make sense of
the seemingly insurmountable problems that are becoming increasingly
evident even to those that would prefer to deny their existence,
