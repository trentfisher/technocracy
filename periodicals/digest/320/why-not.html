<p>
<h3>A NEW APPROACH</h3>
<p>
ALL THE HUFF and gruff of getting the Premier of this
Province to step down was an exercise in futility, one that attacks
only the surface symptoms and leaves the source of the infection
untouched.
<p>
While certain politicians may be social deficits
(even social cancers) in their own right, their eradication would not
alter the primary ills of society.
<p>
Furthermore, it is a matter of record that, when one social
deficit is eradicated, there is always another ready to take his/her
place.
<p>
Behind all these antisocial acts and attitudes is an ancient economic
system which penetrates and corrupts nearly everything within the
society. It is this system that must be indicted and banished forever
from this Continent.
<p>
The people of North America must take action, not
merely because it is desirable, or expedient, but also because it is a
matter of survival.
<p>
Technocracy, which advocates an entirely new approach
to today's problems, points out that: the monetary system causes the
individual to seek advantage for himself at the expense of others in
society, and in opposition to the general welfare.
<p>
The present money-based system generates
antisocial behavior and attitudes among individuals and groups; it
creates class distinction and class hatred; it supports social
tensions and internal strife.
<p>
In North America, the monetary system compels people
to live under conditions of poverty, although the goods and services
are available -- or could be produced to satisfy all their needs.
<p>
<h3>Money is the cause of 95% of crime.</h3>
<p>
Money is a world-wide carrier of communicable
diseases. Money encourages waste, creates excessive demands for raw
materials, and provides the motive for environmental pollution, as
well as aggressive wars off this Continent,
<p>
The use of money as a vehicle of distribution is ludicrous
as well as being extremely dangerous.
<p>
However, there is an alternative. Technocracy asks
why not ``measurement'' instead of ``money''?
<p>
Money is an expression of value, stated in terms of
price, (which is why our monetary structure is referred to as a
``price system'').
<p>
Price depends on scarcity. For thousands of years
past, mankind has lived under conditions of natural scarcity, and
still does in most parts of the world.
<p>
Only in North America has technology advanced to the
stage where scarcity has to be imposed artificially in order to
maintain the Price System.
<p>
The only alternative to the use of evaluation as a means of
distribution, is the utilization of the concept of measurement.
<p>
Technocracy's ``Energy Certificate'' is the
only instrument of distribution which can be used in this Continent's
emerging era of abundance -- the progress of which is being speeded
up by automation.
<p>
Technocracy's Energy Certificate provides the
accounting means whereby each individual North American can express
his individual preference as to what he/she wants of the products
which North America is capable of producing.
<p>
That's its function -- to record the demand for
goods and services, thereby determining the amount to be produced.
<p>
By applying one specific technological measuring
device, production and consumption can be balanced, and the first
specification for social harmony is immediately achievable.
<p>
The scientist, who pointed this out, proposed simple
measurement of the total amount of energy used by the North American
Continent in a given period -- a measurement of the energy cost of
physical production and services.
<p>
These measurements would then become the basis for
regulation of all Continental production and distribution as, what we
are faced with is a physical problem -- not a political one.
<p>
If science and engineering can put people on another
planet, it should be a small job to balance production with
distribution.
<p>
Technocracy asks you to study ``Energy
Accounting'' and free literature is available from
