<h1>The Mud Of The Last Ditch
</h1>
<p>
<EM>Howard Scott stated, in the Hotel Pierre address
(1932), that the time would come when ``the liberal'' (the last
resort of the incompetent and stupid), the debt merchant, and the
communist, fighting together in defense of a system of
advantage......will have little or no solace save the mud of the last
ditch wherein they now struggle so valiantly.''
</EM>
<p>
We are now witnessing this strange phenomenon -- exemplified by the
current (grotesque) ``presidential campaign.'' The line of
demarcation between the two parties has been blurred to near
extinction. It is also exemplified by the screaming headlines of the
``downsizing of business'' by layoffs of personnel to secure the
profits of corporations. Popular periodicals such as <EM>NEWSWEEK
</EM>and <EM>BUSINESS WEEK</EM> have used this as their
``cover stories.'' Thousands of white collar workers are no
longer catching the early commuter trains into the big cities, while
the salaries of CEOs climb into the millions, and the stock market is
climbing into the ``wild blue yonder.'' Even the staid
<EM>NEW</EM> <EM>YORK TIMES</EM>  has devoted a series of articles
to the ``Downsizing of America'' describing in detail the pain
and suffering of the victims of the ``downsizing.'' Why?
<p>
In 1933 Howard Scott wrote ``Technology Smashes the Price
System'' which was published in a 1933 issue of <EM>HARPER'S
MAGAZINE</EM>  The stockmarket crash of 1929 was the massive
``heart attack'' of the Price System. It has been kept alive
only by all manner of artificial means: By the order of President
Franklin Delano Roosevelt, millions of acres of cotton were plowed
under; millions of little pigs were killed; mounds of oranges were
sprayed with crude oil to make them inedible -- all to maintain
scarcity for the benefit of profits for business. World War II was a
made-to-order life-line -- production of war materiel
for all the Allies, and then some. Hundreds of thousand tons of war
material -- tanks, trucks, weapons, etc., etc., were dumped into
the Pacific Ocean just to get rid of them. This ordnance was made of
non-renewable resources -- then shipped out and dumped. Then
came the ``Korean Police Action,'' followed by the Vietnam War
-- both very lucrative actions for ``business.'' The wanton,
obscene waste of natural resources in all these actions has never been
headlined as is the current effects of the ``downsizing of
America.'' To keep the record straight, corporations are not the
only institutions that are ``downsizing:'' Government, in the
tug-of-war between the two political parties, are eliminating
whole departments in an effort to ``balance the budget'' and
``cut the Federal bureaucracy.''
<p>
What is really going on? At no time in history has
the human race faced such a dilemma as it is facing today! Not even
the wild animals of prehistoric times of man's beginnings ever posed
such a threat to human existence. Man's discovery of the use of fire
helped him in his fight for survival against creatures bigger and
stronger than he. It took many thousands of years from the discovery
of fire, to the use of extraneous energy (Watt's steam engine, 1775)
in his struggle against hunger, but it did happen. The development of
technology began slowly at first, but it has accelerated to the point
where man has become completely dependent on the continuous operation
of extraneous energy and technological operation for his survival as a
species.
<p>
It is a tragic irony of historical proportions that,
on this Continent particularly, we have developed our technology to
the point where we can provide for every citizen the wherewithal to
live comfortably without the age-old fear of starvation and
deprivation -- but we face extinction because we cannot let go of
old concepts and habits.
