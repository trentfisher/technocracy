<p>
A feeling is developing in many people that no matter what we do
politically, economically, or morally, nothing we can do will help.
For many of us, that fear becomes a reality when we are
``downsized'' or have used our life's savings for medical or
other costs. Many are feeling the fear of seeing the words on a slip
of paper indicating that they are next. Some of us are fortunate in
having resources, that, for now at least, insulate against the forces
of change, but we realize society is undergoing a rising tide of
change.
<p>
What is that ``major force'' that we are
experiencing? Are we again to be visited with a recurrence of the
great Depression in which millions of people lost everything and many
were near starvation? Businesses collapsed. People were near
rebellion, and other governing philosophies such as communism or
fascism were appealing.
<p>
Why did this happen? What caused such a sudden change
in what seemed secure such a short time before?
<p>
The one overriding factor that is not readily
admitted was the tremendous debt creation by the federal government.
Without the build-up of industries for the war effort, paid for
with debt, the economy would have remained stagnant. The only
alternative to preserve the system was to go to the extreme of putting
our Federal government in hock, despite the preaching of fiscal
conservatives and others. Debt has always been regarded as an
indication of moral decay in an individual, but here we have our
shining example of capitalism resorting to that behavior. Why? The
answer is that we were forced to. We had no choice in the matter --
if we were to save <EM>the money system. </EM>
<p>
And we still have no choice but to keep expanding the rate of debt
creation to off-set the forces that undermine the price system.
<p>
The facts are quite visible; men and women employees have become
obsolete. As more and more technical advances are applied to
production, more and more debt must be created to artificially expand
the economy. The operation of the Price System must somehow put
purchasing power in peoples' hands so that they can use up the excess
production. Thus, many unsavory devices are employed -- war,
preparation for war, welfare, subsidies such as paying farmers not to
grow crops, government purchases of dairy cattle to reduce milk
production, storage and destruction of commodities. Tremendous waste
has been necessary to preserve the Price System.
<p>
What have we accomplished with all this evasion of
responsibility? We, as a nation are now in debt more than $15
trillion, and that debt is increasing at the rate of more than $200
billion per year. Yet, we must continue to create more debt. It is the
only way that we can continue with this economy. And as Shakespeare
said, ``Ah, there's the rub.''
<p>
We are now witness to the strident cries from our
political leaders to, somehow, slash the budget. There is little
discussion of the debt, which is heading for the stratosphere.
<p>
The problem, though, is our political leadership, and its many
benefactors: the business and financial institutions, which have no
alternative to the process that has brought us to the brink of
disaster. Their attempts to ``fix'' the problem by cutting back
on the very devices that salvaged the financial system from a collapse
before, will aggravate the conditions of an already seriously ailing
social system.
<p>
There is no possible solution to our social problems
that can come from our present socio-economic structure.
<p>
Many aspects of our lives are based on beliefs and
emotion, and they, of course, are what make us human. But they can
also be an interference when trying to evaluate problems.
<p>
The events occurring in our country have never
previously happened -- and will not happen again. What this means
is that we have gone from the necessity of human toil in our struggle
for existence to the ability to produce goods and services with just a
small need for physical labor.
<p>
This phenomenon was scientifically studied in great
detail much earlier in this century. The learned men and women who
conducted this study were leaders in the fields of engineering,
physics, education and architecture, to name a few. They applied the
scientific method to the investigation of the effect of technology on
society, and with this method they were able to evaluate the
conditions and construct a design to help us in our transition from
the past. They called their organization the Technical Alliance, which
later became Technocracy Inc. The most significant factor that was
discovered was that technology has irrevocably changed our way of
living, and that we must adapt to those changes or suffer serious
consequences.
<p>
It is the misuse of technology that is our real
problem. So far, the only idea for the reorganization of society to
become compatible with our new situation is Technocracy's Design. Any
alternative, especially within the scope of politics, offers nothing
but a stumbling forward to catastrophe.
<p>
The vast resources and the ingenious energy with
which people approach problems, when not frustrated by obviously
stupid obstacles, can be counted on to become the components of a
better civilization.
<p>
An intelligent stewardship of North America is
possible with the social design Technocracy offers.
