<p>
The ductile strength of any link in a chain can be determined by the
limit of stress it can endure without breaking.
<p>
Think of the flow of goods from production to
consumption as a ``chain''. If, or when, a link in that chain
breaks down, there is no longer the possibility of a flow between the
two areas.
<p>
When so much is being produced, while at the same
time there are more and more people living in poverty, then we must
realize that a link in the chain is weakening and is threatening to
collapse at any time.
<p>
The weakening link in the chain connecting production
with consumption is: the monetary system!
<p>
Plenty for every citizen can be produced, but it
cannot be distributed because these impoverished people now haven't
the money that would give them access to that plenty. And that
condition is brought about by the stress that technology is putting on
the Price System chain. So much more can now be produced by machines,
but with less man-hours of time and labour required in the
process.
<p>
The ductibility of our present method of social
operations has just about reached its limit! That fact is evidenced by
all of the increasing monetary problems with which the politicians are
juggling. However, they are doing the only thing that can be done
under Price System rules: shift burdens from one area to another.
Those are palliative measures. They are not solving the problems,
because they are not dealing with <EM>CAUSES.</EM> So, politicians
are going around in circles -- which is a sure indication that they
are lost. They don't know how to get out of the Price System jungle in
which they are entangled.
<p>
A compass is essential right now -- and Technocracy provides it!
Investigate its potential. It is the only way out of the
``jungle'' we are in. People must get rid of these two concepts:
ownership, and earning a living. They belong to the age of scarcity
and human labor.
<p>
Our many failures are an indictment against the
attitude taken toward, not only our own species, but also to all other
of earth's life-forms.
<p>
Instead of being led by propaganda, it is time people started using
their brain-power to investigate the facts that immediate changes
to the social system must be made.
