``Economists say technology always created, and will
always create, more jobs than it destroys.'' -- <cite>USA TODAY</cite>,
July 28, 1995.
<p>
<h3>WHAT?</h3>
<p>
Technology has NEVER created more jobs than it
destroys, PERIOD...Technology has created many NEW and DIFFERENT jobs
-- but it always ends up adding to the total efficiency of the
social mechanism, which eliminates jobs. More jobs have been created
by an ever more rapidly expanding economy, resulting, in part, from an
increasing population, and, in part, from starting from a position of
extreme scarcity. And, of course, plus the planned obsolescence --
which has wasted natural resources and increased sales. If technology
created more jobs, on average, there would be no point in its use.
Every business man who buys technological equipment does so because he
knows it will save labor costs.
<p>
If technology created more jobs than it destroys, then how was it
possible to reduce average working hours to one half of the pre-
technological levels, while, at the same time, the ability to produce
has increased some 40 times per capita? How could people be so
gullible as to believe such a ridiculous myth when it's so obvious
that it isn't so? Could it be, that, if one accepts the fact that
technology reduces manhours of human labor, one must also admit that
an economic system based on human labor has been antiquated by
technology?
<p>
<h3>Increased Technology -- Increased Under-Employment</h3>
<p>
This country's economy is already in the process of
maturation, and the population increase, at least in the U.S. and
Canada, is leveling off. And further, anyone can see, by the loaded
shelves in all the stores, and all the automobiles on the streets, and
the big advertising campaigns in progress, that the
pre-technological scarcities no longer exist. As a result, any
further increase in technological efficiency will increase
under-employment. Therefore, it will become ever more difficult to
distribute sufficient purchasing power as a reward for human labor.
This indicates that it is increasingly necessary to design methods to
overcome this problem.
<p>
<h3>Population Explosion</h3>
<p>
Among the many OTHER myths handed down so recklessly
to the citizens of North America, and elsewhere, is that: nothing
should be done about the population explosion. While such growth has
slowed in some parts of the world, the overall increase is now 100
million per year, a growth of a billion people each 10 years. At the
same time the 6.7 square miles of arable soil of 1989 is decreasing
due to erosion, careless management, and over-grazing the
grasslands. Only 0.8 acres of arable soil per capita is not enough for
a decent living standard. If the present 5.7 billion people continue
to double each 40 years, by the end of 2400, there will be one person
for each square meter (a little over a square yard) of arable soil,
even without a further decline in the quality of the soil.
<EM>And, in the meantime, the two people per second who are now
starving will be on the increase. </EM>
<p>
<h3>More Myths</h3>
<p>
Another myth, is that the federal deficit can be
reduced simply by avoiding ``excessive'' expenditures. What a
sad joke! The fact is, in the U.S., the debt has tripled in the past
15 years, and is now increasing by a quarter of a trillion dollars per
year. With the present $4.9 trillion debt, the interest payments are
the second highest of all federal expenditures. This debt is being
used to supply an income for millions of people and corporations in an
attempt to create jobs that technology has already replaced.
<p>
<h3>The Unbalanced Budget Myth</h3>
<p>
This Unbalanced Budget was the method used to get us
out of the great depression of the 1930s, and an ever-increasing
deficit has been required ever since to keep us out. <EM>It must
be admitted that this debt can never be paid, and the sooner the money
system crashes the better.</EM> Lying to ourselves and to each
other, serves only to misrepresent the facts, and to postpone the
necessary action required to solve problems, and allowing them to
deteriorate even further, makes the condition become ever more serious
and dangerous.
<p>
<h3>The Voting Myth</h3>
<p>
How many times have this Continent's citizens been
told that voting for the `right' politician would solve our problems?
How many of us still believe in this myth? Slowly -- far too slowly
-- North Americans are becoming aware that there are no `right'
politicians, and about half of the `voters' no longer waste their time
at the polls.
<p>
<h3>The Political Myth</h3>
<p>
The political method itself is based on the
assumption that beliefs and opinions, traditions and superstitions,
can provide the `leadership' with the information required to operate
and control the most highly complex, computer-controlled
technological mechanism in the history of mankind. This is a mechanism
which requires an ever greater mass of factual information, more
extraneous energy, and less human labor as it produces an ever greater
volume of everything needed by North American citizens. History hasn't
prepared us to understand such conditions -- because they have
never occurred before.
<p>
As technological growth continues at its rapid pace, it continues to
outgrow any possible expansion of an economy designed for the dark
ages. And the political method becomes more and more irrelevant, and
less capable of solving the resulting problems. For example, what
important problem has been solved in the past decade by politicians
without the aid of science and technology?
<p>
<h3>Poverty In The Midst Of Plenty</h3>
<p>
The costs of maintaining an antiquated economic
system and its political control techniques is rapidly becoming
impossible to afford, as well as a hazard to human health. If this is
not correct, then why the debt, why so much misinformation, why an
increasing poverty in the midst of plenty? To expect North Americans
to believe such myths is to assume they are stupid enough to accept
them as facts. But, unfortunately, to date, they have generally done
so.
<p>
<h3>CRIME</h3>
<p>
And, we are told that more jails and more law
enforcement will reduce crime. What it will do is increase employment
in the construction industry and in police departments -- enough to
notice if one looks closely. However, the fact is, a failing economic
system will continue to provide the chief incentive for an increasing
crime rate, and until an efficient economy is in operation, crime will
not be reduced, regardless of the number of jails.
<p>
<h3>Legal Crimes.  Yes,  Legal Crimes</h3>
<p>
Unfortunately, the greatest crimes today are entirely
legal. For example, telling people that technology creates more jobs
than it destroys. This kind of myth reduces the chances that workable
solutions can be found, and understood, before we have reached a point
of no return --in both economic and environmental conditions. If
this is allowed to continue, we will be in deep, really deep, trouble.
<p>
<h3>Ancient Economic System</h3>
<p>
Now that a new world of technology has been achieved
as a result of the increasing knowledge of science, it has completely
antiquated the ancient politico-economic system -- a system
which is completely different from this new world of technology. It is
within this area that most of our problems lie. Debt is an economic
problem. Increasing crime is an economic problem. Poverty in the midst
of plenty is an economic problem. ``Political science'' is
``the plotting or scheming of those seeking personal power, glory,
position, or the like,'' and wrapped in the flag to make it look
patriotic -- and that is an economic problem.
<p>
Technology can produce plenty for all North American citizens with the
present natural resources and the trained operating personnel now
existing on this Continent. It is the economic system, and its
political control mechanism, which can't allow that plenty to be
distributed except to the few people who own most of the country.
<p>
<h3>An Alternative System Has Been Kept Secret</h3>
<p>
An alternative system, scientifically designed for
this Continent's special economic and technological needs, has been
the best kept secret since either before or after the Manhattan
Project in the U.S. during WWII. Keeping this information secret is
another major crime -- which is legal.
<p>
This antiquated economic system, and its political
`leadership,' with its pre-technological methods of buying cheap
and selling dear, cheating and stealing, lying and politicking, never
served mankind any too well, but since the advent of technology on a
large scale, it is rapidly becoming impossible to make it work at all.
<p>
Previously, attempts to improve society's condition were always made
by, first, determining what was thought to be desirable, then, trying
to make the physical world, and its inhabitants, conform to those
desires. Since the use of the scientific method was initiated, the
physical requirements having been determined, attempts were then made
to fit the desires to the physical realities. Except, of course, in
the social and economic fields, where the old methods continue to be
used, which has resulted in the mess we see around us today.
<p>
The very fact that this highly complex technological mechanism exists
today on this Continent should be sufficient proof that the scientific
method works, and that it should be used in designing the economic
system and its control technique.
<p>
Technocracy is the result of the application of scientific techniques
in an economic design with the control methods which fit. <EM>And
its going to have to be used.</EM> People may not like what is
new and so different, before they understand it, but when they find
that it will be far better than the chaos now developing with the
present system, they will like it just fine, and wish they had thought
of it long ago.
<p>
So -- Which Myth Can You Believe? Don't believe any! Learn to
recognize, for yourself, the difference between myths and facts. Learn
to understand, and overcome, the non-factual information being
distributed so recklessly today.
<p>
All the statistics and information to indicate the
direction of today's society are available in any good public library.
The Statistical Abstract of the U.S., publications by the
``Population Reference Bureau,'' ``The Worldwatch
Institute,'' ``The Club of Rome,'' books like Jeremy Rifkin's
``The End of Work,'' are samples, among many others, which
clearly indicate <EM>FACTUAL EVIDENCE </EM>of the road we
are traveling. Even the daily press is a good source of information
concerning current crime and political activities, which demonstrate
the need for a major social change. All these sources point out the
symptoms of our ailing society. Unfortunately, they do not give
solutions, or know the solutions -- which have been determined by
the physical requirements of the job to be done.
<p>
One must investigate Technocracy to obtain the only solution
available. Technocracy is the short-cut to the information
required. Technocracy Study Classes are presented by people who have
gone the long route; in fact, some 75 years have been devoted to this
project.
<p>
<h3>A CHANCE -- NOT A CHOICE</h3>
<p>
Of course, we realize that only a few have the will,
at this time, to study seriously -- in an attempt to replace their
myths with facts. However, we must point out that Technology is the
greatest instigator of social change in history. And social change is
in the process of occurring, and will continue to occur, whether we
like it or not. But, if we are ready for it, we may be able to direct
that change away from social chaos. Never before has a social change
been so complex, requiring as much human understanding, as a result of
that complexity. This is the change which will move us out of the
scarcity age of all past history, into an age of peace and plenty. And
if we fail to make the transition, social chaos will be the result.
That is our choice, and our chance.
<p>
<EM>May we have the intelligence to make the most of it. </EM>
