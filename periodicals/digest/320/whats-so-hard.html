<BLOCKQUOTE>Some people have said to us: ``We don't understand
Technocracy. It just won't work. We can't read through all that
stuff.'' Now, there's negativeness for you! They don't understand
it, won't make an effort to understand it, so how would they know it
won't work?.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Just consider this: A life without money! That's all
you have to know to understand Technocracy. Your imagination can tell
you the rest. It's as simple as that.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
Just think: what would <EM>Your</EM> life be like without
money? You wouldn't have to worry about how you were going to pay that
next month's rent. Your housing would be provided for you. So would
your heat and light. You could educate yourself to the best of your
ability; that would be provided. You wouldn't have to worry about
health care; that would be provided. In fact, you might not even have
any health problems, as you would have regular medical checks from
birth, and if any defects turned up, you would receive the best care
that science could provide.
<p>
In a Technate (that's the name WE have given this
social system, but regardless of what it is called) everyone would be
given an Energy accounting card. Everything that is produced takes
energy. The energy that it takes to provide goods and services to a
population would have been totalled, and after the amount needed for
essential services had been subtracted (essential services: your
housing, food, health care, education) the remainder, for your other
needs, would also be divided equally among the citizens. Your
purchases (needs) would be entered in your Energy accounting
card/Certificate as you required them. These Energy Certificates would
provide a running inventory to show what goods people liked, which
would then need to be manufactured.
<p>
This type of system could have been in effect 60
years ago. What has held it back? The financial and political houses
of this Continent. Incidentally, they have made you believe they're
your pals; they're not. They are your enemies. They have deceived you
with their propaganda all these years. For over 60 years we could have
had food and clothing for our children, instead of these statistics:
many thousands of children under the poverty level are underfed,
undereducated, and on the streets. Also, our parents and grandparents
suffered years of repression; they couldn't achieve the goals they
longed for. If something isn't rectified soon, the present generations
are going to suffer the same consequences, and indeed, may be already
in the throes of poverty.
<p>
How strange it is that we have the will to provide a
healthy, satisfying, comfortable life for every person on this
Continent, but these are being denied us by the interference of
politics and money -- and we are allowing it to happen. We have the
intelligence, the know-how and ingenuity, and the materials, to
build anything we like that is needed to provide all citizens with
what they should have -- as is their birthright. Scientists, like
engineers, teachers, medical practitioners, artists, artisans, could
have been happily improving our habitat all these years, but they have
had their work throttled politically and financially, so that they
have not been able to show the best that they can do. For example, a
proper road cannot be built because it would cost too much money. A
new school cannot be provided because it would cost too much money;
or, a hospital would be built but only half the size and quality it
should have been -- because it would cost too much money. Or,
perhaps there is enough money to do these things, but the political
party in the area won't release the money because they would get
static from another section also clamoring for money, thus putting
their political futures in jeopardy.
<p>
You see, with money out of the picture, you could
reach your potential. You would have to donate some of your time to
your country by working so many hours -- a fraction of what it is
today -- but the rest of the time would be yours -- with lots of
leisure hours and days to travel, educate yourself, indulge in sports,
paint, sculpt, write, and enjoy the wonderful world we had given to
us.
<p>
You wouldn't have to worry about your welfare because
this would all be taken care of by experts in their field, all chosen
by their peers -- the engineers, teachers, medical staff,
electricians. These people do their jobs quite well now, except for
the political and monetary interference. You can usually count on your
telephone working; your lights coming on when you push a button --
and you don't have to bother learning what makes them work. You can
drive a car, and yet not have to know what makes it run. You can punch
the keys of a computer and come up with all kinds of information, and
yet not know the function of any of the masses of wires inside the
frame. But, if you did want to know more about what makes these
mechanisms tick, then you would be free to study the intricacies of
them. The same thing with Technocracy: if you want to know more about
the subject, then be our guest. We have always asked people to
``investigate Technocracy.''
<p>
But, in any case, you would not have to worry about your welfare in a
Technate. The services would be provided for your comfort and
pleasure. This is all possible, and it would be a simple process to
install this new social system. All it needs is for you to join us in
our demand for a complete change of the social system. We must have
this action by a concerned public in order to overcome the apathy that
has brought us to the brink of devastation.
