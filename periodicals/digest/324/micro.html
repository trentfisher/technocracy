<p>
Specialization is being thrust upon us in almost every
realm of human endeavour. Magazines such as <EM>Scientific American</EM>,
as well as the multitude of trade, educational, and in-house publications
that swamp us every day, indicate that knowledge and understanding
is accelerating at a rate that can be overwhelming even to the trained
scientist and technologist. The message is clear. As the accumulation
of knowledge adds to an ever-greater understanding of the intricacies
of nature, this volume of information necessarily constricts the particular
area which can be investigated by any individual or group.
<p>
The subdivision of faculties, such as biology, has been going on for
years. However, the research in these sub-divisions, for example
molecular biology, has resulted in even further refinements, to the
point that whole groups can now spend years on a particular project
that is only an infinitesimal part of the work being done in that
field. That this is necessary, is self-evident. The volume of
knowledge makes it impossible for anyone to be a specialist in more
than one or two finite areas.
<p>
In the realm of science, particularly at the level of basic research,
peer publications, meetings, and conferences keep scientists generally
informed of the progress being made in their particular area. Even
then, some information is left in limbo, only to be rediscovered by
someone else, and used as a helpful starting point for a new avenue
of exploration in their field.
<p>
In the field of applied science, increasing specialization is evident.
Engineers trained in environmental sciences may specialize in fresh
water purification, sewage treatment, chemical decontamination, nuclear
waste, etc. As with basic science, the increasing complexities of
living in a modern technological world are forcing engineers and technicians
to focus more narrowly in their chosen field.
<p>
Given the increasing complexity of the problems, it is inevitable
that even peer review does not necessarily foster unanimity in the
search for either direction or solution. When the limitations of the
Price System debt operation are factored in, it is surprising that
there is any agreement on the options available.
<p>
This specialization can lead to such a narrowing of perspective, that
the overall problem is forgotten in the search for a local solution.
The decision whether to treat human effluent in one location, without
due consideration of the impact that it can have on other areas, is
now quite common. If you are up-river, the solution to your problem
may be quite different from, and not acceptable to, those down-river
from you.
<p>
In addition, the involvement of individuals or groups that have no
expertise in the area under discussion, can have serious consequences
on the final solution. The disgusting condition of the air, land,
cities, and waterways of this Continent, is testimony of the destructive
results of financial and political manipulation and interference in
purely physical matters, by groups having no expertise in science
or physical law.
<p>
What, then, is the answer to this conundrum? Is there a method that
can insure that the proper level of expertise is coupled with the
ability to integrate all the attendant problems, so that the solution
is indeed correct and total? Of course there is!
<p>
Howard Scott, the founder of Technocracy, understood that this facet
of human behavior was the bane of social organization, and that if
we were to overcome this blockage to the solution of North America's
unique problems, a fully integrated structure was necessary. This
concept is all the more remarkable, given that it was conceived many
years before the current explosion of scientific knowledge.
<p>
The structural sequence specified by Scott as necessary
for a smooth social operation, reflects the need for not only the
specialist, but also the need to understand the inter-relationship
of the whole. Whether the whole is just a sum of the individual parts,
or a more dynamic force having much greater potential, is entirely
dependent on its functional ability. The key to this is specialization,
tempered with the ability to envision the integration of the whole.
<p>
It was Scott, with the Technical Alliance, who first
saw the interrelationship of the physical and financial operation
as it pertained to North America. This pulling together of all of
the physical and financial trends was an undertaking of a scope never
applied before, or for that matter since, in the area of human social
interaction.
<p>
This integration of all the available information concluded that only
upon the replacement of the non-measurable debt structure that
is crippling this Continent, with one more attuned to the physical
realities of modern technology, could the future be assured.
<p>
Technocrats may be specialists in their own field, but they know that
the only way to understand the problem is to look at the whole picture.
Only by studying the trends as evidenced in all fields of human endeavor,
can we formulate the solutions necessary for an assured future. The
designing of residential housing; transportation systems; water, sewage
and electrical power generation and distribution; health and education;
food and consumer production and distribution, is the province of
the specialists in each field working in concert with every other
field. The design for human living is too important to be left to
any individual or small group. Because of this, Technocrats do not
discuss the intricacies of these specific areas of human endeavor.
<p>
It is Technocracy's analysis and design that we put forward for public
scrutiny. Only after acceptance of this analysis and design, and the
physical health of this Continent is known, can the proper controls
be put into place to ensure a high standard of living for all citizens.
Only Technocracy and Technocrats are working to this end. We will
settle for nothing short of success.
