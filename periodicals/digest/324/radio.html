<p>
Technocracy presents to the radio audience of WGAR the
dilemma of this country and of this Continent.
<p>
The United States and the Continent are endowed with natural resources
sufficient to meet the raw material needs of our citizens for centuries
to come. The United States and Canada possess more installed horsepower
and more machinery than all the rest of the world. The United States
and Canada have more trained men and women capable of efficient operation
of the technological equipment for the production and distribution
of the social needs of their people than any like area on earth.
<p>
Re-stated simply, this country has the men, the materials, and
the machines. It has the brains to devise greater technology for greater
social needs; and yet the United States and Canada today, while possessing
all the necessary elements for social well-being, are stymied
by our antiquated political and economic structures.
<p>
The social institutions that sufficed in the United States in the
days of the ox cart and the horse and buggy are today simply junk,
blocking the road to our progress.
<p>
The recession has deepened into a depression. Our government admits
that eighteen million Americans are on the various relief rolls of
the country. It admits further that the United States employment service
has over six million applications for employment in its files; and
at the same time it is generally admitted that unemployment is approaching
the precarious total of fourteen millions. Technocracy asks, `Where
is the prosperity of yesteryear, and what has happened to our promised
``abundant life''!' And, in answer to these questions comes
the magnanimous declaration of our federal government that it is going
to spend its way out of this depression with the slight sum of four
billion five hundred and twelve million dollars; merely a sweetening
of the national jack-pot!
<p>
The federal administration in Washington and the Dominion administration
in Ottawa both proclaim that the national policies which they have
formulated are the best and only possible methods of procuring national
well-being under the existing conditions. The national governments
of both the United States and Canada promise many things. They promise
higher prices for the farmer, more business for the business man,
higher wages for the worker, better banking for the banker, and a
higher national income for everyone. Their promises are so many that
they are all things to all people and nothing to any one.
<p>
Technocracy states frankly that in view of the technological factors
of this country today, such a policy on the part of our national administration
is the rankest hypocrisy that could possibly be perpetrated upon a
sorely suffering people. Technocracy points out that national business
supports our national administrations in this great hypocrisy; that
both are guilty of collusion and misrepresentation of the facts of
our national operations. Such hypocrisy in these times is as deadly
and dangerous and even despicable as that of distributing chocolate-covered
arsenic to high school students.
<p>
National business and national governments contend that they both,
singly or together, can rectify the national dilemma facing this country
and this Continent today. National business contends that it can solve
the dilemma of unemployment, insufficient purchasing power, and want
in the midst of plenty, if it is permitted to indulge in more business
with less government interference. National governments contend that
they could obtain the solution if they were permitted to have more
government and more business.
<p>
These claims on the part of both government and business are the rankest
of barefaced assertions. Neither government nor business, regardless
of what they do, can possibly rectify the critical situation in which
the United States and Canada find themselves today, for the United
States and Canada are engaged in the greatest social conflict in human
history, and a conflict which, at this time, does not exist anywhere
else. It is the conflict between two systems of producing physical
wealth. For seven thousand years of social history Man has produced
his physical wealth by human toil, and now in this country and on
this Continent the technological process of producing physical wealth
is shoving the old process onto the scrap heap. Business and government
are shrieking loudly for North Americans to obtain a higher standard
of living. We must increase our national production of living. We
must increase our national production of physical wealth, we are told.
<p>
This statement sounds fine to the uninformed public, but the facts
of the case are these: the technological production of physical wealth
in the United States and Canada requires an ever- smaller total
of man-hours per year to produce an ever greater volume of physical
goods and services. When greater physical wealth is produced, North
America will produce it, but the more physical wealth North America
produces the less human effort we will consume in its production.
<p>
These facts are obvious to any student of our national situation;
and yet our national leaders have the barefaced effrontery to claim
that more wages and salaries will be distributed when America produces
more physical wealth.
<p>
From now on, the United States and Canada will produce more and more
with less and less human effort. And why not? Toil is the morality
of slaves. Gears never tire, machines never sit down, and technological
machinery will do the work of America's tomorrow.
<p>
In the face of this, Technocracy states that it is physically impossible
to pay out sufficient purchasing power in salaries and wages to the
American public to buy back the increasing productivity of our national
machinery; and if an ever smaller number of Americans are going to
work fewer hours per year, can you possibly conceive how either government
or business can raise the purchasing power of our citizenry to where
relief and unemployment will be totally eliminated?!
<p>
Technocracy wishes to make quite clear that the national problems
of the United States and Canada are technological problems and that
they therefore cannot be solved by any process of political democracy
or chicanery of financial economics.
<p>
As relief lines lengthen, foreclosures increase,
and retail sales fall, business begins to scream at federal governments
for its own salvation. Business and government are sick; they are
sick from the obsolescence and antiquity of seven thousand years of
scarcity. But their cure would cost more than their demise, for in
this conflict there can be no compromise. Either the people of this
country and Continent must destroy their technological equipment and
expurgate their science, and return to the human toil of hand tools,
with its accompanying shibboleths of democracy, or they must face
the stark realization that there is more and greater technology to
come than America has ever known; and Technocracy asks again, why
not?!
<p>
Why should this country and the Continent be condemned by the political
machinations of democracy and the ineptitude of national business
to the national anarchy of more relief, more unemployment, and more
crime?! If national business and our political government cannot solve
the dilemma of America, then it is high time that they step aside
and make way for those who can.
<p>
As the millions of Americans who have been liquidated
by the oscillations of the Price System are increased by more millions
in the greater oscillations that will occur in the near future, there
will arise a mass demand, Continent-wide, for a new leadership
capable of directing America to her rendezvous with destiny. National
business is going to insist on its pound of flesh, and Technocracy
predicts that America will be compelled to liquidate national business,
once and for all. National politics is going to insist on the privilege
of continuing its national bungling, and it will join national business
in the coming liquidation. It is high time that the citizens of the
United States and Canada realize that politics and business stand
in the road, blocking the pathway to North America's future.
<p>
<p>
This country and the Continent have the men, the machines, and the
materials to provide every person on the Continent with the decency
of the highest standard of living in the world, from birth to death,
with the minimum of human effort and the maximum of leisure. It is
high time that we North Americans enroll in the Technological Army
which will make the U.S. and Canada safe for their citizens!
<p>
America has no war off the Continent. Americans have nothing to gain
and everything to lose by participating in any warfare abroad. North
America has only one war, a war to be fought here and now, on this
Continent, alone. It is the war of plenty versus poverty, of leisure
versus toil, of abundance versus scarcity. It is a cause not to die
for, but one to live for. Technocracy contends that it is high time
we enlisted in this greatest of all wars, for this war will have to
be fought and won if civilization on this Continent is going to avert
the chaos of national anarchy. Enlist now, before you are conscripted
by the march of events.
