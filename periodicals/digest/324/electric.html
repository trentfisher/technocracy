<p>
The recent electrical power collapse in the Western
States in the United States prompts us to ask: what is this massive
system supposed to do? Is its main purpose to supply electric power
to consumers and industry? If that is the reason, then certain requirements
would be incorporated into its design. These design criteria would
include such things as reliability. The designers would be instructed
that interruptions of the flow should be reduced to virtually zero.
One such interruption could be an attack by terrorists from without
or within the United States. A mere handful of people with readily
obtainable explosives strategically placed in unprotected and unprotectable
spots, could bring our whole society to a halt in minutes. Unlike
Vietnam, which received more bombs than all those dropped in World
War II, and survived, we could not. The system design we have today
has totally neglected this potentially fatal possibility.
<p>
On the other hand, here in California, the challenge of earthquake
damage has largely been met, so we know that when a challenge is identified
it can be successfully handled. However, even though everyone today
knows that we have a serious problem with finding a source of energy
to supply this electric system in the very near future, we do next
to nothing about it. This is in spite of the fact that almost all
of our literate population has at least heard the word, ``ecology,''
and millions of them have a working knowledge of how ecosystems work.
Have we, as a society, injected the requirement that this electric
system be, not only reliable, but sustainable into the future? To
be more direct, don't these millions who know about ecosystems plan
to have any children or grandchildren?
<p>
For many years, decades in fact, a system for the
transmission of electrical power over great distances has been available.
The surplus power available in the Northwest could be shipped via
one- to two-million volt underground cables to all points
in California with very little loss. The recent power outage, allegedly
caused by trees shorting out an inter-tie, would be a thing of
the past. It would be virtually immune to terrorist or nut-case
sabotage.
<p>
The source of power, hydro, is actually free and
is sustainable forever. The ugly ``wirescape'' we have created
in wilderness areas would be gone. This technology has already been
developed and is already in use in Sweden and other countries. With
all these advantages, just what is holding this development back?
The answer is that: it is not considered an engineering challenge
but a PRICE SYSTEM challenge. Consider, if this line were to run the
length of California through the Central Valley, it would disrupt
the private power companies' stranglehold on what we reverently call,
``the market''!
<p>
When this system was first proposed many years ago,
the reaction of these companies was as expected. They are, after all,
not in the business of distributing power. Any distribution of energy
that occurs is beside the point. Their main interest is the flow of
money, not power, so these companies successfully interfered with
the design. They managed to reduce the capacity of this new extra
high voltage direct current line to less than half, placed it above
ground, and routed it east of the Sierra Mountains, well out of the
way, eliminating any competition for their turf.
<p>
We know that we have the engineering knowledge and all the available
materials to do these jobs, or, for that matter, any job. So what
is the matter? The answer lies in the fact that these are not engineering
problems. These problems are system-design failures, not engineering
failures. Our technological society is controlled today by an ancient
system that evolved over several millennia to the present. In this
last century of human society on earth, we have seen the introduction
of a technological revolution, a revolution so great that it is affecting
every aspect of our lives more than all previous generations put together.
What we are seeing today is a gigantic collision between the old way
of doing things and its requirements to perpetuate itself, and the
brand new requirements of today's technological society.
<p>
In this old way of thinking, certain requirements pertaining to money,
more properly called ``Debt Tokens,'' such as profits, interest,
bonds, property rights, dividends etc., are given absolute and complete
priority. Technological, engineering, and ecological considerations
are always given short shrift. Why is this so? The answer is that
the people we have put in charge of our society are steeped in the
goals and needs of what we call the PRICE SYSTEM. This system is defined
as, ``...any social system that effects its distribution of goods
and services by means of a system of trade or commerce based on commodity
valuation and employing any form of debt tokens (money,) constitutes
a Price System.'' It is obvious why we have, today, what some describe
as: people putting the needs of the present antiquated system first
and dedicating themselves to preserving the system and themselves.
<p>
As an example: the director of the Los Angeles Department
of Water and Power resigned the other day because he was refused a
salary raise of $190,000. Previously, he was a legislative (not engineering)
analyst for the Mayor! Would anyone question where his priorities
lie? One can search far and wide to find a trained technologist in
charge of anything in our society. The federal Communication has never
had an electronic engineer in charge. They have all been lawyers!
The businessmen, and the politicians who work for them, know nothing
about the vast technology they are supposed to control. It should
be obvious why we have today, what some describe as, a run-away
technology. As the late President Nixon is said to have joked, ``Ladies
and gentlemen this is your pilot. We have some good news and some
bad news. The good news is that we are making record-breaking
progress. The bad news is that we don't know where we are going!''
<p>
The massive power outages that have occurred over
the past years were not technological failures. They were PRICE SYSTEM
failures. Let us examine, for instance, a simplified example of a
failure mode. If you start to consume power when you turn on your
toaster or whatever, the generator at a distant power plant must be
able to supply at least this amount of power. A second appliance turned
on would slow down, and overload the generator, causing safety devices
to cut the line, leaving your toast undone. If you should decide to
turn on all your loads at once, the power generators better be ready
with sufficient reserves of steam and capacity to handle all foreseeable
circumstances.
<p>
The huge power outage in the Northeast, a few years ago, was because
too many operators forgot about daylight-saving time, and the
load-surge arrived one hour earlier than they anticipated, shutting
down system after system until the capacity of the whole Northeast
grid was exceeded.
<p>
Surprisingly, few deaths occurred, and no one burned their toast for
a while, but nine months later the birth-rate took a large jump!
The really funny part of it was the President declaring that a little
black box in Canada caused the whole thing. Nonsense! The cause of
that, and the recent West Coast failure, was the Price System operators'
control over the technologists. They demanded that the extra capacity
to be kept on hand for emergencies should be kept to an absolute minimum
so as not to interfere with profit. What happens to reliability? In
our present society, operating under rules that date from ancient
times, we know what has priority!
<p>
The electrical system is but one of the technological systems that
we must rely on to enjoy life in North America. We have a food chain,
housing, transportation, communication, water, education, and many
other functions that must be maintained for us. We can look at any
of them and find near catastrophies in all.
<p>
Take a look at how we grow our food. Our agribusiness people have
decided, with their focus on profits and the ubiquitous bottom line,
that we must mine our food, not grow it. We pump oil out of the ground,
convert it into fertilizer, and grow huge crops. This is not sustainable.
Fifteen years ago we reached the peak of the total world supply of
oil and the end of this abundance of food produced by mining is in
sight. We also have immediate problems with herbicides, millions of
tons of which are obtained from mined oil. Formerly, a few noxious
weeds invading the fields were a small nuisance. But now, the same
type of resistance that Rachael Carson warned about decades ago has
happened, and they have become major threats, and call for more and
more herbicides to control.
<p>
Like heroin, these dealers rejoice at this addiction because, under
our present PRICE SYSTEM rules, this behavior is their only option.
These dealers are not bad people; they are simply doing the only thing
they are allowed to do. There are many alternative farming methods
available today, but they are not used because the Price System rules
will not allow them into the market.
<p>
What can we say that is correct about our transportation system? There
has recently been a dim recognition that there is something wrong
with forcing people to drive a two-ton vehicle twenty to forty
miles a day from their house to a job. We have made ourselves slaves
to the automobile. Since the control of housing is in the hands of
the real estate interests, there is no chance of rationalizing our
transportation planning. In addition, the automobile industry accounts
for one out of six jobs, so any shift to light rail would be a catastrophe.
May we build a high-speed rail system to replace the energy-guzzling
jet planes? Not a chance!
<p>
Communications are being played around with so much, lately, by huge
financial interests that it is almost a joke, except when you try
to figure out how to dial a long-distance call, or tune in a decent
TV show.
<p>
Education today is for the main purpose of training
people for a job. Every day, as everyone should know, more jobs disappear
forever. This obsolete goal must be changed. We should, and can, train
our children and adults how to live, not how to make a living. The
required courses should be: music, arts, crafts, and other vocations,
to prepare our citizens for the work-free world that science and
technology have made for us. Unfortunately, our minds have been so
filled up with the obsolete garbage, from the past, that we cannot,
or will not, see that the future is here today.
<p>
There are many more areas of our society that we
could examine, and we will find that all areas of our society are
afflicted with debilitating effects by obsolete Price System control.
The hard-working, dedicated, hand-wringing liberals of all
types, from the tree-huggers to the homeless advocates, have completely
missed the problem. The items that they are targeting for reforms
are not problems. They are merely symptoms of a much larger social
malaise. Chasing after, and even curing, these symptoms will not remove
the hold that the Price System way of management has on our society.
The tree-huggers' and environmentalists' clash with the Forest
Service and owners will be for naught until they examine the Price
System's men on Wall Street who are the real determiners of how fast
the trees will fall.
<p>
What they should be tracing doesn't stop there. The
Price System,...that system of trade based on commodity valuation
is the real boss in this tragic drama. If the reformers got as far
as examining the Price System, they might be getting somewhere. If
they asked what kind of morals or human values it had to allow and
even encourage ecoside, they would find none. Socialism (or capitalism)
with a human face? That is absurd. They should be asking the questions
and doing the analyses that we are doing here. What would they find
if they did these analyses? They would find that there are no problems
in North America that do not have readily available, practical and
easily implemented physical solutions. Instead of putting on ``band-aids,''
they could be part of the solution to North America's problem by identifying
the culprit: the Price System.
<p>
Technocracy Inc. has made this analysis -- starting
in the 1920s. Howard Scott started this educational organization in
1933 to try to teach North Americans about the failure of the Price
System and how the scientific method, applied to the social system,
uncovered the failure mode. Many books and papers have been published
by Technocracy explaining how anyone can do these analyses themselves.
<p>
Technocracy did not quit with this successful analysis. By using the
same method, namely the Scientific Method, Technocracy has come up
with a synthesis for a new society which is described in the book,
Technocracy's Technological Social Design. It is beyond the scope
of this piece to review here, but it is essential that all North Americans
avail themselves of this information.
