``Give us the truth'' was the title of an editorial in a South
Carolina newspaper where they were discussing U.S. politics. ``Secret
deals are the essence of American politics.'' (Read also, Canadian
politics.) ``The long-standing tradition of political deals
struck in smoke-filled rooms where king-makers rule and the
average voter is a mere statistic, is one that will never die.
<p>
``We like to think that we have matured. The key words in modern
political circles are phrases like `coalition building', `voter appeal'.
New power groups -- women, blacks and other minorities, especially,
-- have emerged, giving the political scene a different look. But
has the game really changed?
<p>
``The answer to that question -- if we believe a fraction of
what we are learning in the news these days -- is a resounding
no. In fact, if what we hear is even possible, then American (Ed.
and Canadian) politics may have reached so low that Richard Nixon
and his men will forevermore be considered amateurs.''
<p>
Oh, yes! Give us the truth -- What an interesting idea! But how
many would be willing to believe the truth if it disagreed with the
things they had been taught since childhood, or if it could result
in a loss of profit?
<p>
Wouldn't it be great if our educational system was allowed, and required,
to educate us concerning that most fundamental part of the educational
process: a simple method for determining the difference between that
which is so, and that which may very well not be so? Wouldn't we then
be able to recognize the futility of the political method, whether
it be of either the right or the left? Wouldn't we then be able to
see that the world's present economic system is based on a myth?
<p>
In science, we are already taught that the only information which
can be depended upon is that which is verifiable by some type of physical
measurement. If the information is not verifiable by measurement,
it may not be so. In science, a fact is a close agreement of a series
of careful observations of the same phenomenon that can be verified.
And, only facts are accepted as a criteria of truth.
<p>
The application of this scientific method, which has been so successful
in this technological age, should be just as successful in providing
an understanding of the politico-economic system. This should
also give us the ``truth'' in this field. In fact -- it is
a fact -- that the scientists who founded Technocracy Inc., have
already done so, and their resulting information is so different than
the political myths that we have been taught to believe, that many
refuse to acknowledge it could be so. Nevertheless, the predictions
and statements made by Technocracy during the past sixty years, have,
and are, occurring, as predicted. The deterioration of the financial
institutions in the U.S. and Canada, is only a part of the economic
collapse now in progress.
<p>
Economic trends, based on financial trends alone, are not enough to
determine the direction of a highly technological society. The physical
trends that shape America's growth, also shape the economic trends.
And, we must consider the fact that <EM>no physical growth can continue
increasing forever.</EM> Therefore, an economic system designed to operate
on the continuous growth of its physical operations, cannot continue
forever.
