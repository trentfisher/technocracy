<p>
People certainly are! It's because they don't know
which way to turn! The present social system is in such a mess; jobs
being downsized, people out of work and thus, no money with which
to buy even necessities; man-made disasters, crime, pollution,
stress; no good times in sight. People are swayed this way and that
by media information and mis-information; they don't know whom
to believe. But, there is a way to assess the truth; a means by which
you can find out what is actually happening now, and what is bound
to happen because of the bungling of both financiers and politicians.
<p>
To assess the truth, you use the scientific method. You use science
just the same as you do when you want a machine to work, or you are
building something you want to last.
<p>
That is how the research and educational organization, Technocracy,
came into being. It had its inception in 1919 in New York City in
an organization known as the Technical Alliance of North America,
formed by seventeen competent, educated people.
<p>
They were: Frederick L. Ackerman, Architect, Allen
Carpenter, M.D., Carl L. Alsberg, Biochemist; Louis K. Comstock, Electrical
Engineer, Stuart Chase, CPA, Alice Barrows Fernandez, Educator, Bassett
Jones, Mathematical Technologist, Sullivan W. Jones, Architect, Robert
D. Kohn, Architect, Benton Mackay, Forester-Naturalist, Leland
Olds, Statistician, Howard Scott, Engineering Scientist-Technologist,
Charles Proteus Steinmetz, Electrical Engineer, Richard C. Tolman,
Physical Chemist, John C. Vaughn, Surgeon, Thorstein Veblen, Educator
and Author, Charles H. Whitaker, Architect. They chose Howard Scott
to be their chairman; he later became Director-in-Chief of
Technocracy.
<p>
The primary aim of the Technical Alliance was to ascertain
the possibility of applying the achievements of science to social
and industrial affairs. With this in mind, they undertook a survey
of the energy and natural resources of the North American Continental
Area. In addition, they studied the industrial evolution that had
taken place therein. They showed graphically the operating characteristics
of the present industrial system with all its waste and leakage, and
worked out a tentative design of a completely coordinated system of
production and distribution. They kept in mind always, of course,
their aim, which was to provide a better standard of living in the
continental area with the least possible waste of non-renewable
resources.
<p>
These seventeen people did research, in their own
special fields, for 14 years, and concluded that machines would eventually
be able to take over many of the tasks then performed, thus releasing
people from drudgery and allowing them to have more freedom and leisure
time to take up pleasant pursuits that would broaden their minds,
entertain them, and make life here on earth a wonderful place for
them. And isn't that what it's all about? Isn't that what is supposed
to happen? Enjoy this beautiful world around us?
<p>
Instead of that, politicians and financiers have hoisted the Price
System flag and everyone is supposed to salute it. Different methods
have been devised for a few at the top to enjoy the fruits of the
labors of the 95 percent at the bottom. The lower layers are left
to scurry around, most of them forced into unsatisfying jobs, scratching
and scraping for money. When the produce of the machines in the crammed
warehouses started spilling over, as it was now a glut, or because
the majority couldn't afford to buy it, wars were pulled out of the
hat so the produce could be sold and used up, resulting in more money
getting into the hands of the already rich, regardless of the blood
being spilled by the many who fought because they were told they must
be loyal to the Price System flag (OOPS!) country. These wars --
I and II, Korean, Viet Nam, and Gulf -- have all been pulled off
for the same reasons.
<p>
Even though most people now have jaded views of politicians and the
whole social and financial process of no jobs, no money, they still
are running around in circles, trying to find ways out of the maze.
They still do not want to start thinking for themselves -- why
they are struggling to keep alive in a system which is catering to
a few.
<p>
We urge all of you in that category to just sit down a moment and
think. Even the media carries articles that could make you aware of
why you are in a poverty-stricken situation. In another article
in this magazine, is a list of some of these disasters chronicled
in the media -- calamities that need never have happened.  And,
if you want to know<EM> why</EM> they happened, then keep reading
our articles.
<p>
And, if you want to know  <EM>how</EM> you can
have that happy, leisure time we mentioned above, Technocracy does
have the solution. Over 60 years ago, the Technocracy, Technological
Social Design was offered to the citizens of this Continent. It still
is.
<p>
We urge you, for your own sakes, and for the sakes
of your children, to start looking at things from a scientific viewpoint,
and you can then come to the conclusion that the only thing that can
work to solve social problems caused by the present financial system,
is that Scientific Design. We hope you will, because then the work
of the Technocrats will be done, our research and education finally
heeded, and we, too, can enjoy that leisure time.
