The question of ebonics has been trashed all over the
electronic and printed media. This subject from a Technocratic perspective,
which the media avoids covering, addresses the subject in a different
light.
<p>
The author is an English teacher in an inner-city
school in San Francisco, writing to the Editor of the San Francisco
Chronicle.

``As an English teacher, I have followed the debate on Ebonics.
As a person attending Christmas parties, I have listened to several
heated conversations on the topic. To me the question seems beside
the point, except that in our social-economic system, all points
seem cash-driven; bilingual funds may, or may not, be forthcoming
to quell the waters. Meanwhile, why are so many Afro-American
students doing so poorly in school? It isn't because ``public forum
speaking'' is, or isn't, taught.
<p>
Most teachers acknowledge the realities of black
English, and would probably be even better off if they were more educated
on the topic. I teach ``standard'' English and I, myself, pick
up Ebonics. When I wish to, I say ``She be goin'.'' I love the
variety, rhythm, and expressiveness of Ebonics. Its use is not confined
to African Americans.
<p>
So why are large numbers of African American students
failing or barely scraping by? (And they aren't the only ones!) Here
is the answer: Because so many live in economically deprived homes
in economically deprived neighborhoods. Why is the infant mortality
rate of Afro-American babies so high in Oakland, California? Not
because ``I be pregnant'' goes linguistically dishonored or
misunderstood. It doesn't even get heard, or is heard in over-crowded,
under-staffed medical facilities. If we are going to talk about
schools and the ``education'' we rave on about, we had better
admit to the over-crowded and under-staffed conditions there
too.
<p>
Is this system willing to pay for real change? It
isn't and it can't. The only organization I've seen with a viable
alternative is Technocracy. Maybe it will be taken seriously, maybe
not. For now I will continue to teach English as quickly and accurately
and humanely as I am able, but I assure you it is not nearly enough.
