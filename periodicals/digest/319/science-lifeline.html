<BLOCKQUOTE>Because of the lack of understanding regarding the
importance of science and technology in keeping us alive, many people
fear and mistrust it.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The apologists for the status quo blame our ills on the
use of too much technology, and people tend to believe what they are
told, rather than evaluate it for themselves. Serious academics, and
self-styled intellectuals, foster this romantic ideal -- a
society with less technology.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
Some see disaster in every new technology. It has even been
stated that the laws of physics were constructed to maintain white
male dominance. More relate only to its more horrifying manifestations
-- environmental horrors, weapons of mass destruction, and other
examples of mis-applied technology.
<p>
Education down-plays the role of science and
technology in our history, like: electricity, radio, television, jet
travel, antibiotics, moon landings, eradication of disease, computers,
communication, and many of the technological innovations, which are
enriching our lives, and even keeping us alive. Many only see the
mis-use to which some of these discoveries have been put, again
ignoring the fact that this mis-use of technology has been for
individual or corporate gain, even though the discoverers have no
control over their eventual use, good or bad.
<p>
Science is, in a dynamic sense, essentially a method of prediction. It
has been defined as being the method of the determination of the most
probable. It is the most accurate method available to us. It is based
upon facts; when more facts are known, more accurate predictions can
be made. A fact is a close agreement of a series of observations of
the same phenomenon. They must be verifiable, in other words, able to
be repeated.
<p>
As can be seen from the foregoing, science, and its handmaiden,
technology, is just a method -- the best known -- for acquiring
knowledge for the benefit of humankind. How this knowledge is applied
is up to us. At present, it is used largely for profit of individual
or corporate gain. The end result is much of what we see today, and of
which so many people decry. It is used for short-term, monetary
expediency, with little thought to the long-term survival of the
human and other species on this planet.
<p>
If this knowledge was to be used on a functional
basis, applying these discoveries and innovations for the benefit of
humankind, and life in general, much different results would be
obtained. We could conserve our resources, recycle and re-use
them, where practical. We could use the discoveries of science to
improve our educational facilities, health facilities, and knowledge.
We could repair the damage to our environment, cut back on soil
erosion, build up the water table. Transportation could be improved;
we could cut back on the hideous waste and pollution caused by
automobiles. This would require a radical change in housing people,
and providing services.
<p>
So much could be accomplished by the proper application of the
scientific method, using science and technology for the benefit of
humankind, not for its detriment.
<p>
Why do scientists not voice more concern? Why do
scientists, who are forever complaining about scientific illiteracy,
not do more to condemn this foolish short-sightedness? Is it fear
of being labelled intolerant, or is it fear of placing their financial
security in jeopardy? Are they afraid that someone, or some group,
with a vested interest in the status quo, will discontinue paying them
a salary?
<p>
The public needs to understand that we live in a finite world,
governed by natural laws. These cannot be circumvented, and we try to
do so at our peril. We can understand that we can use these natural
laws, and that we can apply them for the benefit of humanity.
<p>
Nobody claims it will be easy. Each new scientific discovery, or
application, brings new problems. Scientists understand the problems,
and it is to scientists, and those trained in the scientific method,
to whom we must turn, to solve these problems.
<p>
As stated previously, science is a method -- the method of
determining the most probable. It is the method that has advanced
humankind down through the ages. This is not because scientists have
any monopoly on intellect or virtue. It is because science is the only
method we have to sort out the truth from ideology, or fraud, or
foolishness, or ignorance, or bigotry.
