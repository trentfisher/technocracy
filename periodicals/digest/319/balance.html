<p>
So! We are going to balance the budget by 2002? In the United States,
the efforts to balance State and federal budgets have only begun. As,
and if, their efforts continue, the numbers of homeless, the numbers
needing welfare, and the crime rate, will continue to increase far
beyond that indicated by an excellent letter to the editor of the New
York Times, December 18, 1995.
<p>
Shelly Nortz, Director of State Policy Coalition for
the Homeless, Albany, wrote, in part, ...``When it comes to welfare
grant levels, experts from the Clinton Administration and even some
governors have predicted that state welfare officials will compete in
a `race to the bottom' in a block-grant environment to avoid
`attracting' needy families from other states. ...Selectively quoting
Roosevelt, calling `unfettered welfare' a `narcotic' that destroyed
the human spirit, N.Y. Governor Pataki, (leading the pack) proposes to
eliminate the Home Relief program altogether and cut $153 a month from
a family of three so that the `narcotic' welfare benefit equals that
of New Jersey. Mr. Pataki also plans to eliminate more than $90
million in court-ordered rent subsidies paid to more than 23,000
New York City families facing evictions because of inadequate housing
allowances....The proposed grant cuts will force these families to the
edge, with eviction and homelessness soon to follow. ...Only 20,000
recipients would be able to get jobs, another 60,000 jobless
recipients would be disqualified from getting any state assistance,
and some 68,000 older and disabled individuals would require state
disability assistance.
<p>
``Should lawmakers approve the plan, only about
one in three New York City public-assistance households and less
than one in five in the rest of the state would even have a chance at
remaining housed by the time the next wave of cuts arrive.
<p>
``The taxpayers who will benefit the most from Mr.
Pataki's tax cuts -- those with an adjusted gross income of over
$200,000 a year -- will realize an average 1996 state
income-tax cut of more than $82 per month.'' A continuation of
these efforts prove that political ``leaders'' consider the
economic system more important than people.
<p>
The excuse for such budget cuts? It is necessary to
reduce the increasing chances of governmental bankruptcy. And that is
certainly correct. The federal debt is, or will be, within the next
several weeks, $5 trillion, and is increasing at about one-third
of a trillion per year. It adds up to being about $19,000 per capita.
To this, add another four to five thousand dollars for State and local
debts, plus all corporate debts which are added to the price of
products the consumers must buy, and it becomes obvious why consumer
debts are, by far, the highest in history.
<p>
Now, with all these debts on which the public must
pay interest; with prices higher than ever before; with
under-employment increasing rapidly; with all the
``downsizing'' now in progress, while the purchasing power of
the public has been on the decline for the past 20 years, it should be
quite understandable why so many people and businesses need government
subsidies of one kind or another.
<p>
With such conditions developing and showing no signs
of changing -- except to become worse -- there are only three
possible options available to the U.S. and Canada:
<ol>
  <li>Governmental bankruptcy.
  <li>Bankruptcy for all, including government.
  <li>The installation of an entirely new, and entirely
      different, economic system.
</ol>
<P>
Under present modern technological conditions, the
present economic system can no longer operate, so the
above-mentioned three are our only choices.
<p>
Being patriotic to a system, or to a method, is NOT
being patriotic to one's country, and neither is considering an
economic system more important than people.
<p>
It is time we became able to admit that important
changes must be made. We have only three choices and only one
solution. That one would be Number 3: Technocracy's Technological
Social Design -- the installation of an entirely new and different
economic system.
