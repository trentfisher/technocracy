<p>
The strike against the Boeing Co. is generating headlines these days.
It is a showcase of the futile attempts to somehow divvy up a fair
share of the rewards for work accomplished by people. The managers at
Boeing are under pressure from stockholders to maintain, or increase,
the value of their shares. Employees feel threatened that, not only
will they have reduced income, but that their jobs will be offloaded
elsewhere.
<p>
That scenario is being repeated throughout the country. What we fail
to grasp, is that we should have come 'way past this type of behavior
years ago. As this society advanced technologically, the need for
human labor decreased to the point that, at best, we have become just
machine tenders and office junkies. Technology should be for people,
rather than for profit.
<p>
For-profit-only, benefits a declining part of our society.
Someone once said, ``The poor are always with us.''
Technocracy's blueprint for the physical operation of our Continent
illustrates just how to use technology for the enhancement of the
human condition. If we continue much longer to ignore the pressing
social problems, caused by the inability of our present method of
governance to tend to the legitimate needs of its citizens, chaos will
govern. We are better than that.
<p>
I believe, given correct information, that the people of our country
can make intelligent decisions concerning what's best for them and for
our fellow creatures. Investigate Technocracy. See for yourself what
is possible. <EM>We might not have much time.</EM>
