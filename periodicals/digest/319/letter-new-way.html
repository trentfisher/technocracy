<h4>New Way Of Life</h4>
<p>
Before, during, and now, after the election of a new batch of
politicians, the media continues to flood us with ``cutting the
deficit'' and ``balancing the budget'' analyses. My comments
on these phenomena reflect a background in Technocracy, Inc., an
educational, research organization.
<p>
Deficit spending has been an important part of our way of life ever
since the '30s. The only change has been its astronomical growth. Our
memories are short. During the Great Depression, budget cuts were
enacted to reduce deficit spending. What happened? We had a depression
within the depression. Deficit spending had to be increased to solve
the problem.
<p>
Good times, or what were considered good times, and
deficit spending, go hand in hand. Without it, the economy would
crumble. Now, we are told that deficits will crumble the economy as
well. So, we are damned if we deficit and damned if we don't deficit!
In other words, no matter what manoeuvres politicians try, the system
just won't work.
<p>
What we know, for sure, is that we are in serious
trouble. Politicians -- collectively and singly -- offer no
solution, just promises tried before and found wanting then. Bluntly
put, politicians are useless. The security of our society depends on
doing something drastic, but it has nothing whatsoever to do with
deficit spending, balancing the budget, etc.
<p>
Our socioeconomic structure, our ``Price
System'', adequately handled the operation of society during the
slow-pace, hand-tool, stoop-labour days of the primitive,
agrarian age. Practically everyone had a job, or could get a job.
There was no welfare or mass-unemployment. Today, because
assembly-line production, computer robotic automation, downsizing,
reinventing government, etc., employing the entire workforce is a
physical impossibility. Deficit spending has been the linchpin that
has maintained the economy, as bad as it is, and has kept it from
terminal disaster.
<p>
In our high-tech, modern technological age, our Price System
manipulations are a tragedy, causing widespread, unnecessary
suffering. We must install a design of social operation that is in
sync. with our modern times, and take advantage of the technological
advances, not leave ourselves punished by them.
<p>
Technocracy proposes that we trash our Price System and install a
modern technological social design. We are talking about a whole new
way of life. Deficit spending, balancing the budget, welfare,
unemployment, poverty, taxes, etc. vanish.
<p>
Those who study Technocracy's proposal find its concepts exhilarating.
Yes, it's a whole new way of life. Check it out.
