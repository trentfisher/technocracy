<h3>Science should be applied to Canadian Social System</h3> 
<p>
``Science is the pursuit of knowledge -- the
systematic endeavor to understand and interpret the natural
world,'' says a writer (Bulletin, Sept. 18)
<p>
She says: ``Thomas Edison successfully blended
science with technology, when creating the light bulb.''
<p>
History shows that by applying science to energy
conversion we progressed from human muscle to the electric turbine.
<p>
Science and technology have given us a new lifestyle
-- a beautiful age.
<p>
Think of our homes as compared to the homes in the primitive past.
Then people died from the cold. Now we turn up the thermostat and wake
up to a warm home.
<p>
Applying science to communications we progressed from writing with a
``quill'' to instant world-wide computer messages via
satellite.
<p>
Applying science to transportation, we progressed
from walking, to the age of the airplane.
<p>
Technocracy was the first organization to apply
science to our social system.
<p>
This <EM>``technological social design''
is</EM> the only available plan, designed to distribute
North America's abundance of goods and services to all of its
citizens, and so set an example for the world. No more soup kitchens,
poverty, unemployment, crime or debt.
