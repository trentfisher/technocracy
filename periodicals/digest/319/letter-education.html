Dear Editor:
<p>
I am writing in response to Denise Helm's Oct. 2,
1995 article, ``Teacher Burnout.'' I am an inner-city high
school teacher from San Francisco, and I found much to identify with
in this article. Unfortunately, I can't readily supply comparable
statistics for California. I do, however, know that hundreds of
teachers in San Francisco apply for the much smaller allowable number
of sabbaticals. I have certainly seen statistics which state that over
half of all teachers leave the field of teaching within five years of
beginning to teach. I personally know many teachers on leave, on early
retirement, about to leave, and I myself took off one year without pay
immediately after becoming a tenured teacher.
<p>
I was impressed with your description of a survey
which concluded, `Teachers' chief concern and frustration was not
being able to meet students' social, emotional and physical needs
..... ``Altruistic as it may sound, I agree this is what burns out
teachers. We see a vast array of problems and barely make a conscious
acknowledgement of one before the next unmet need parades itself by
us. Often, there are several vying for our attention at one time. I
don't think teachers are unusually compassionate human beings, nor are
we particularly selfless. (Although romanticized stories which promise
unwarranted hope for our current system would have you believe we
should and could be). But we are there in the schools, witness to the
needs students have. Also, at any moment we can be held responsible
for one of these needs not being met: ``Why wasn't a mental health
referral done?'', ``Why was a mental health referral done?'',
``The parent tells us he wasn't even notified of ...'', etc. Too
much responsibility, too little help, too little power.
<p>
Another constant is that students must test the
limits of adult authority. It is a healthy and necessary part of
growing up, exploring the world; finding a place in it. However, when
students are painfully restricted in their access to adults (parents,
gone or working; relatives, distant, gone or working; community,
skimpy, if any) they will test those adults they do have access to
-- their teachers. It becomes tricky and even maddening for a
teacher to have to interrupt the lesson numerous times to display what
the limits of adult power are in that classroom. And students are best
comforted to find those limits are in place; that the teacher is
strong, confident, and won't permit the students to run riot over the
learning process. But give that teacher 150 students, too many
responsibilities, etc., and the students may soon find the teacher is
not that strong.
<p>
I have my own personal threshold which finds the
during-class phone calls unnerving, the bells annoying,
unnecessary paperwork insulting, and on. I love to teach, and a
serious reality is I need a paycheck.
<p>
With these givens, I have concluded I will make the
best of the situation until an alternative can replace it. The sooner
the better. There is an organization called ``Technocracy''
which has the best alternative I have seen to date. Over sixty years
ago members researched the problems and resources of the North
American Continent, including our educational system, and came to some
conclusions. The gist of those conclusions has not changed. We need a
new system to fit the day and age in which we live. We need our
students to be educated, protected, and encouraged, instead of
warehoused, threatened, and depressed.
<p>
I see so much classroom behavior that is either too
aggressive or too passive. Animal populations under too much stress
become both overly aggressive and overly passive. No individual
teacher, or group of teachers, can remediate an entire population
under increasing stress. We need to restructure society so that our
future is all that it could be.
<p>
There are many published articles by Technocracy
which describe proposals for organizing our future, and explain why we
must do so. Technocracy is an educational/research organization and
printed information is readily available.
