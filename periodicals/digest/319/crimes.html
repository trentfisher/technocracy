North America's culture is a culture of science -- which if taken
full advantage of -- will usher in a new way of life. Let's pause
and reflect on science, wars, and ``crimes against humanity.''
<p>
<STRONG>Science. </STRONG> On August 4th, a good portion of both the
electronic and printed media focused on a marvel of science. A
four-year old boy, through the wonders of science, has an ear
implant, and for the first time, is able to hear. What a magnificent
difference science has made in his life.
<p>
<STRONG>War.</STRONG> August 6th was the celebration (?)
of Hiroshima, 50 years after. That, of course, is both war and
science. Science, or better still, its misuse, makes science
two-faced -- it can drastically improve life and/or end life,
maybe all life.
<p>
<STRONG>Crimes Against Humanity. </STRONG>This is an
expression coined in 1946, but no attempt has been made to find the
origin of ``crimes against humanity.'' Consider this as a
realistic possible origin: before the era of science, when
civilization was in its infancy, a clan suffered a natural disaster
that destroyed its food supply. This clan invaded a neighbor's
territory, killed all that clan's people and, as a spoil of war, took
their entire food supply. This could very well be the origin of
``crimes against humanity.''
<p>
Mr. and Mrs. Will Durant, in their book, The
<EM>Lesson in History</EM> tell us that, of the 3,421 years
of record history, 3,153 (98 percent) were war years. With no stretch
of imagination, one realizes that during 98 percent of human history
``crimes against humanity'' were an accepted part of life.
<p>
North America has the possibility of reversing this aspect of history
because its applied science -- technology -- is so huge. If we
adjust properly to our ability to produce an abundance, utilizing
science's best, we can bring future wars to their lowest possibility.
It follows that ``crimes against humanity'' will take the same
course.
<p>
For an explanation of a society built around science's best, one would
be well advised to read Technocracy literature which is readily
available.
