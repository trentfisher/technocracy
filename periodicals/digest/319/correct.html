<EM>Since the technological age became a significant
progression on this Continent, the financial system -- designed in
the dark ages -- has become increasingly antiquated. With almost
every phase of its operations in the U.S., the financial system is
indicating ever greater signs of stress. In the past, when a problem
developed, it could be corrected, at least, temporarily, by taking
money from other areas to fix it. However, in recent years, the
problems have developed in so many different areas at the same time
that the ability to correct them is becoming almost impossible. Not
only do we see declining profits per investment expended, but also
increasing bankruptcies, debt, public, private and corporate, all
together, adding up to about four times the federal debt alone. We see
increasing underemployment; far more production than can be sold; a
decline in the value of the dollar; and increasing poverty.
</EM>
<p>
Consumer debt has increased from $296.2 billion in 1980 to $741.1
billion in 1992. Consumers are being squeezed between higher prices
and increasing underemployment (decreasing purchasing power.) The
federal budget has increased from $45.2 billion in 1945 to $1.09
trillion -- an increase of 18.8 times in the past 50 years.
<p>
Never before have such staggering changes occurred in the financial
operations of any country on earth. This increasing stress on so many
types of fundamental financial operations has no precedent, and
clearly indicates financial problems of unusual proportions. To top it
off, our money is losing its value: the 1995 dollar is worth less than
one- quarter of the 1945 dollar. And the Canadian dollar is worth
even less. Since these financial trends are increasing in rapidity
toward ever greater heights, one may expect one's present savings, if
any, to become worthless in the near future.
<p>
It is the people who work -- who have an income of
some sort -- who must pay all these debts, plus interest, in
addition to supporting their families. In 1992, the federal debt alone
was $31,143.97 per employee, and the interest paid on it was another
$1,543.09. But this is not all, by any means. The employee's share of
the state and local debts is $7,227, plus interest on it. Here, we
have only added government debts and the interest thereon. Employees
must also pay higher prices to pay corporate debts, and also pay taxes
to pay farmers to produce less so prices can be kept up. They must
also buy insurance to help pay for medical bills which have gone so
high that they can't afford to be without insurance. Can there be any
doubt concerning the reasons why poverty is increasing so fast in the
land of plenty?
<p>
In 1929, these same trends existed but on a far smaller scale. The
depression of the 1930s lasted a decade, and was about 30 percent
worse than any previous depression. This was a financial depression,
and it could be kept from deteriorating into complete chaos only by
the application of federal credit on an unprecedented scale.
<p>
World War II presented the excuse to increase the debt even faster,
which allowed sufficient purchasing power to be distributed to achieve
the appearance of economic normalcy. At the same time, with 27 million
people withdrawn from normal activities, far more was produced than
ever before. So much for technology making more jobs for people! Some
might think we had Hitler to thank for stabilizing our financial
system, easing for awhile the drastic changes required.
<p>
The present financial crisis, with these critical trends many times
further advanced than in 1929, would have us into a depression of
chaotic proportions if the increasing debt was discontinued. Now, with
financial bankruptcy staring us in the face, the politicians must
choose between bankruptcy, financial chaos, and a prospect even more
dreaded by them: trashing this system of price to install a
non-price system. Consider, please, what would happen if either of
the first two was allowed to happen.
<p>
Our problem is financial, not physical. The physical world continues
to operate quite satisfactorily. The sun rises in the east; the
application of energy to mass continues to change iron ore, plastic,
and glass into automobiles; highways and railroad tracks still allow
industrial products to be moved to the areas of use. Our technology is
constructed by the use of physical materials and human knowledge
concerning those materials. Now, our technology can produce plenty for
all North American citizens. <EM>But they can't use this plenty
because of the restrictions of an antiquated financial system</EM>
-- a system which only provides the incentive for rendering our
planet ininhabitable.
<p>
No one can doubt that something must be done about
this financial crisis. But what? Everything that has been done so far
has failed; not only failed, but the problems continue to grow worse
at an ever increasing speed.
<p>
Patriotic people will try to help their country, but
it can't be done by refusing to admit that corrections are needed. One
can't fix a problem one can't, or won't, see. May our country always
be correct, but if it's not, let's fix it.
<p>
<EM>Technocracy's Technological Social Design is the only
solution available, so, let's get on with the job. </EM>
