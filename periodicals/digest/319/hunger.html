<EM>Recently, the new ``Conservative'' government in
the Province of Ontario instituted a number of significant, (read
significant in the context of the devastating impact on those
affected, not in terms of a solution to the province's debt), cuts in
the province's payment for a number of services that have been a part
of the social fabric for many years. One of the cuts affected the
payments for food and shelter, those basic necessities of life that
all of us require, but that, for various reasons, are not readily
obtainable by a large segment of the population.</EM>
<p>
The ill effects of substandard food and housing on the
physical and mental well-being of people from infancy to old age,
although well documented, seems to have little impact in the making of
these policy decisions. That the powers that be are aware of the
physical consequences of their action, is attested to by the attempt
of the minister in charge, Mr. Tsubouchi, to downplay the serious
effects that these cuts will have on the welfare of those affected. In
their attempt to diminish the resulting outcry, an old,
time-tested piece of social baloney was once again trotted out for
public enlightenment. Only this time, the baloney was ``TUNA''.
<p>
From their safe southern havens, they voiced their opinions.
``Smart shopping is all that is needed, take advantage of the
sales, and stock up on tuna when it's on special.'' This type of
policy and its ridiculous justification, is only too typical of the
type of nonthinking, nonsensical, and all too familiar, unenlightened
reaction of the political leadership to today's serious problems.
<p>
We can expect no more from those whom we continue to elect to
positions of control, given their lack of understanding of the
problems, and their obvious desire to maintain the system, regardless
of the consequences.
<p>
But should we expect more of those not involved in
the political structure? The acceptance, and even the endorsement, of
these policies by a public weighed down with its own problems and
looking for a convenient scapegoat, can be understood even if not
condoned.
<p>
And what about the media? In its intellectual rush to either prove or
disprove the government's public relations gaffs, the proposed diet
was tried for a week. What utter nonsense! Is this the investigative
reporting on which the ``fifth estate'' so prides itself? Is
this the intellectual height, or depth, as the case may be, that our
journalists have reached, while purporting to be the conscience that
keeps our society's leaders honest? Have they forgotten the basic
tenets in writing? What about the five w's? Have they forgotten Who,
What, When, Where and Why? And in this instance, the first question
should be, WHY?
<p>
Why is it necessary for anyone to have to plan their meals in this
manner, in the first place? Why should a large number of people be
restricted to a limited amount and choice of food? Why is the
distribution of our abundant food supply so restricted? Why can't it
be distributed more equitably, to ensure proper nutrition is available
to all? Why do we let this condition persist?
<p>
Who is responsible for these conditions persisting, and who benefits
from them? Who is in position to either restrict or enlarge the food
supply? Where is the excess food that we produce? What is it costing
us to store this food, and who is paying for it? When did this
condition come about, and what are the causative factors involved? And
finally, what can we do about it?
<p>
These are a few of the questions that could have been
asked; no, should have been asked; if the news media was seriously
interested in understanding both the extent and seriousness of the
problem. But, of course, it couldn't have stopped there. No
investigation, no matter how complete, could have stopped at food
alone. Food is only one part of the problem, a significant one, but
only one, nevertheless. And here is where the failure of our system of
journalistic endeavours is most acute.
<p>
Every day, news reports inform us of problems in
every sphere of human activity, ranging from minor to major
environmental problems of local, national and international scope;
population pressures; resource depletion; social unrest and turmoil;
crime; inadequate housing, health and educational facilities;
transportation; and international relations. But, to the vast majority
of the knowledgeable population, these problems have only a vague, if
any, connection.
<p>
What is the media's role in this lack of understanding on the part of
the general public? Surely the information available to the public on
a daily basis, is enough to send everyone looking in the right
direction. But it is precisely this lack of direction for which the
media must accept responsibility.
<p>
Raw data is useful only if it is analyzed and its
salient related points identified. Related material presented in this
manner cannot, except by willful intention, be ignored. However, the
lack of a coherent effort on the part of the media, which controls not
only the amount and content of the information, but the context in
which it is presented, as well, to find the commonality tying our
social problems together, is seriously hampering any rational and
reasonable attempt to solve society's ills. They would be of far more
benefit to society if they pushed themselves away from Tsubouchi's
table and started to question the whole antiquated concept of today's
Price System method of social operation.
<p>
Before the general public can begin to understand the
basis of our many problems, today's journalists will have to cast
aside their preconceived ideas, broaden their focus, and really start
to investigate on a more fundamental level. <EM>They could do no
better than to start with Technocracy!</EM>
