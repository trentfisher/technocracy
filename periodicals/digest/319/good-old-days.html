<EM>Sometimes, some older folk have lapses of memory as
they recall some aspect or event of `the good old days', and yearn
that life could still be the same as it was when they were young. They
forget that much of their life at that time was anything but pleasant.
If they were among the minority of people then who were financially
secure, these may have been sublime years for them. There was little
crime -- perhaps, because there were fewer people then, or we never
heard about it, or because cities were not so large and there were
more rural areas. ``We never had to lock our doors,'' they say,
as they discuss the horrors of the crime scene today. ``We had
different values then,'' they say. Did we?
</EM>
<p>
Most people then were very poor, whether they lived on the
farms or in the cities. And yes, even though they lived in poverty,
they can recall something that they wish had never changed. But, for
the most part, they remember the disadvantages and stress that poverty
heaped upon them. Life was made hopeless for so many of them.
<p>
For people living on the farms, it meant very hard
work, with always the threat of unpredictable weather that destroyed
their crops, and the weather patterns at that time seemed to see to
this, year after year. Many of them in the dust bowls of the Prairie
provinces of Canada, lost their homesteads, so they headed north,
packing their belongings in covered wagons, like the Old West
depictions, driving their stock ahead of them. Once in the north, they
had to start all over again, wresting the rocks and stumps out of
unbroken land.
<p>
In the United States, there have been innumerable heartbreaking
narratives of the treks from States -- like Oklahoma, to California
-- when many people starved to death, and the remainder discovered
that California was not the golden State, as terrible hardships still
had to be borne.
<p>
Those who stuck it out on their farms, at least had food, but there
was little hope for further education or opportunities for themselves
or their children. Most of the rural schools could barely pay their
teachers (and sometimes didn't) let alone provide education beyond
Grade eight. Many children had to quit school at that grade anyway, to
help on the farm, or hire out to another farmer for barely subsistence
wages. It wasn't a joyful outlook. In the cities, life's blows were
much harder. Many had barely enough to eat; many had nothing to eat;
many subsisted on hand-outs from relatives or friends or
passers-by on the streets. ``Brother, can you spare a
dime?'' Do you remember that one? Many young people, and older
also, couldn't even afford the 10-cent cup of coffee or the
two-bit hamburger, as they trudged the streets looking for any
kind of work, unable even to afford the street-car fare.
<p>
Working girls, if they were lucky enough to get work
-- waitresses, stenographers, store clerks -- didn't live in
apartments in those days. As many as four or six of them shared the
rent in one or two bare rooms, furnished only with as many beds as
were needed, a sofa which made up into a bed, a table, chairs, and a
hot plate to cook on, and perhaps a sink, and that was it. The
bathroom, shared by many people, was down the hall.
<p>
Of course, there were many people living on the streets then too.
Whole shanty towns sprang up where families lived in shacks made of
cardboard and discarded metal sheets. (Shamefully, these shanties
could still be seen in the early fifties -- by people driving the
highway from Los Angeles to the gambling cities of Las Vegas and Reno.
And even more shamefully, there are many more in existence now, and
are in evidence in every city and town, and in them, people huddled
for warmth.)
<p>
There was crime then too -- thievery, bootlegging,
prostitution, and there were gangs -- Ma Barker, Bonny and Clyde,
the Mafia -- all documented one way or another. Young people were
drawn to them because of poverty. There was no work for them, and the
gangsters seemed to be leading an exciting and prosperous life. Jail
was usually where they ended up, and so began an endless circle of
crime.
<p>
Or, they `rode the rails' -- and were called
``bums'' or ``hoboes'' -- begging for food from people
in small towns where they shared food for a few days with other
`hoboes', and shivered in their bedrolls at night, under the starry
sky, or a makeshift rain cover cardboard shelter, in a ``hobo
jungle.''
<p>
Oh, yes, `them were the days' alright. There was very little `relief'
(welfare) then, and some people were too proud to ask for help, that
they would even starve to death. If people were sick, they just
suffered it out all their lives, or died in the attempt. They couldn't
afford even to see the doctor, and many doctors also suffered hard
times. The country doctors, again, fared a little better than city
doctors, because people were, at least, able to pay them with
vegetables and chickens.
<p>
Then, in 1939, there was an abrupt change. War was declared. It was
like money came out of thin air. Young men, by the thousands, joined
the army. They were given food, money to spend; the lads envisioned an
exciting life of travel and adventure, with no thought of death.
<p>
Factories, to build war materiel, sprang up, and women, and men unable
to join the army, were hired; their wages were more than they had ever
envisioned. Patriotism was encouraged by propaganda, and no thought
was given then to the cost everyone would eventually pay, from the
loss of our brave young people, and the exploitation of our natural
resources, and as we later found out, the exploitation of all of us.
<p>
For awhile, after World War II, the economy boomed. Natural resources,
like minerals and forests, were gouged out, and huge
multi-nationals flourished and ran the world. But people had more
money than they had ever had in the Dirty '30s. They were able to have
comfortable homes and educate their children. Any warnings made about
pollution or eventual poverty, went unheeded. Since then there have
been smaller `depressions' in the economy, but these have been propped
up by other wars -- the Korean War, the Viet Nam War, and other
skirmishes -- and people, unbelievably, even after ``the War
that was to end all wars'', sent their young people into battle
again and again -- even to as late as 1992, propagandized again
into wearing yellow ribbons as they sent their young into Desert
Storm.
<p>
<h3>A change of values? What change would that be?</h3>
<p>
People's ways are still guided by a wish for monetary gain. They still
believe that we must have money -- that's the law to live by. They
have been taught to believe this -- in other words, they believe
the propaganda that has been fed them for years and years. To this
day, little children, at home and in school, are taught ``the value
of money.''
<p>
The only organization that has tried to explain that: <EM>money
has no value,</EM> is Technocracy. Our organization, for over 60
years has tried to explain that. As long as we have the natural
resources, the expertise to make use of them, and not mis-use
them, the technicians and engineers to keep our high energy mechanism
running, who needs money? Everything we need, can be provided, without
using money.
<p>
Change of values? Nothing has changed in the
make-up of the human being in the last million years. He is
basically the same person he was then. The only thing that has changed
in the last 100 years or so, is our environment. As more and more
people find it increasingly difficult to maintain a reasonable
standard of living within the framework of what we call a Price
System, you may expect the kind of behaviour with which we are
concerned today, as it starts to manifest itself.
<p>
When, once people are prosperous and fully employed; when they have a
virtual degree of certainty that things will continue this way for
them, most people are content, and the society is well ordered. When,
once people realize that all the things they need on a
day-to-day basis will be supplied by virtue of their personal
needs, they would then look for more satisfying ways of expressing
themselves. When acquisitiveness is taken out of our society, the
standard of life would increase. <EM>THAT</EM> would be a real
change of values.
