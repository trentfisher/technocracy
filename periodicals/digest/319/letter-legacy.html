What kind of societal legacy do the people of this Continent wish to
leave for their children and grandchildren?
<p>
Do they really want them to live in the same crime-ridden,
politically mis-managed, and corporate-manipulated society
that they, their parents, and countless generations before them have
had to suffer?
<p>
<h3>Surely not!</h3>
<p>
One incessantly hears the claim that the United States is the greatest
democracy in the world. Where do they get the effrontery to make such
a statement? The dictionary describes democracy as a system of
government where the power is invested in the people, and social
equality is the prime objective.
<p>
Can anyone seriously state that the system of operations now in use on
this Continent matches that description?
<p>
I am sure that the vast majority of people do not wish to live in an
environment so polluted that the very act of breathing, necessary to
life, becomes more difficult with each passing year. Some authorities
even suggest that, by the turn of the century, or shortly thereafter,
people will be required to wear masks in order to breathe at all.
<p>
If the citizens of this Continent are serious in their desire for a
pollution-free, crime-free mode of operations, they will
simply have to abandon the present system, and opt for a new and
challenging concept of social control. It is such a tragic sight to
see people reaching for the light, while their feet are still mired in
the darkness of superstition and fear.
<p>
The twin shackles of superstition and fear of change must be set aside
and replaced by a sincere faith in the scientific and technological
advances that are heralding the new age.
<p>
Technocracy points the way to this new age. Surely no one wants to
wait until the collapse of the present system brings chaos and
anarchy.
