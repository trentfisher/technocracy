Are all the messages going to be too late? Ignoring
those calls will cause serious consequences, not only for you, but for
all of us.
<p>
We Technocrats have been ringing alarm bells for over 60
years. As the resonance of the alarms comes closer and closer, as
frightening monsters loom into sight, don't you think you should arm
yourselves to combat them?
<p>
<h3>In 1995, the headlines in the news became bolder:</h3>
<P>
``<STRONG>Disease-carrying</STRONG> tiger mosquito closer
to Canada'' -- The Asian tiger mosquito, with a bite more
vicious than the native North American mosquitoes, was introduced
accidentally to Texas a few years ago in a load of used tires from
Japan, and has the capacity to carry 15 different diseases.
<p>
``<STRONG>Bird Kill</STRONG>'' -- Birds, are needed
to keep down the population of varieties of harmful insects, but they
are allowed to be killed off by the thousands. A catastrophic outbreak
of botulism and industrial pollution at a reservoir in central Mexico
has killed 40,000 migratory birds that were feeding in the area,
according to a report released by a NAFTA environmental commission
inquiry. The only SUGGESTED solution: detonated devices to frighten
them away from this one spot, and a feeding program at an alternate
site.
<p>
``<STRONG>Insecticides linger</STRONG>, spread, study
shows'' -- An analysis of tree bark suggests that insecticides
and fungicides have spread over the globe often thousands of
kilometres from where they were used, and that some chemicals sprayed
decades ago are still affecting the environment -- all 22 of them.
And are we still spraying chemicals? oh, yes.
<p>
``<STRONG>The beginning</STRONG> of the food crunch.''
-- Consumers who fuss at the cost of salmon may not give a thought
to world population growth. Yet those high prices could be the first
instalment of a population-driven food crunch. Are people still
going to resist population control?
<p>
``<STRONG>Unemployment</STRONG> resumes climb in October''
-- Unemployment in Canada stood at 9.4 per cent in October --
due, the report says, to the end of summer work. What will be the
excuse for lack of autumn work?  Perhaps in December
snow-shovelling work will be available?
<p>
``<STRONG>Most of us</STRONG> finding it harder to make ends
meet'' -- ``Slightly more than half of Canadians find it
harder to make ends meet in 1995 than they did five years ago, a poll
released today indicates....One-quarter of respondents believed
the economy will improve over the next 12 months.
<p>
``<STRONG>Poverty statistics</STRONG> hit high as 1 in 5
children grow up needy'' - ``With wages shrinking, more
Canadian families have become increasingly dependent on the social
safety net.
<p>
``<STRONG>Medical system</STRONG> financially
strangled'' -- And to add to the problems of the poor, many
delegates to the annual meeting of the Canadian Medical Association
are calling for a parallel private health system. Do these doctors not
contemplate where their money will be coming from as even the more
affluent middle class are losing their jobs?
<p>
``<STRONG>Overdue acid-rain</STRONG> report devoid of
pollution standards, remedies'' -- In this acid-rain report,
the environment mentioned is New York State's Adirondack Mountains
which they state may never recover from acid-rain pollution. Acid
rain would also affect birds, wildlife, people on the whole Continent.
<p>
``<STRONG>Growing pollution</STRONG> of oceans'' -- 102
nations agree to tackle growing pollution of oceans. Which brings up
the question, why would 102 nations have allowed the oceans to be
polluted in the first place?
<p>
<EM>Don't ever think</EM> that the fall-out
from all of these is not going to affect you.
<p>
Every one of the problems listed, exists because of
people's neglect to eradicate them at their source. Every one of them
depends on the other. These events have all been existent, and have
all been noted, even in the media, but any remedies mentioned are
either too miniscule to have been effective, or they have not been
carried out at all.
<p>
Why? Because people were lulled into complacency. And why
were they? Because the remedies were going to cost money.
<p>
Ah! There we are! Right at the root! <STRONG>Money!</STRONG>
Cutting into profits!
<p>
Propaganda was always used -- to belay any expense in
setting things right -- and the public believed it.
<p>
Technocracy offers a solution to these problems. Just read on.
