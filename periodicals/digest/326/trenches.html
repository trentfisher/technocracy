There was an article in the San Francisco Chronicle, May 26, 1997, by
Jonathan Marshall, entitled Beyond the Bruises; The Cost of School
Violence, who reported that a study finds higher dropout rates and pay
for teachers.
<p>
Marshall reported that ``In a 1994 Gallup survey, Americans listed
school violence as their No. 1 educational concern. And so they
should, suggests a new study of the hidden economic costs of disorder
in our nation's high schools.
<p>
By disrupting learning and discouraging some students even from
attending class, violence increases dropout rates, and sharply
decreases the likelihood of students going on to college, reports Jeff
Grogger, an economist at the University of California at Santa
Barbara.
<p>
In addition, hazardous working conditions prompt teachers to demand
higher pay, increasing the burden on taxpayers or draining funds from
other educational purposes.
<p>
The most recent surveys suggest school violence is a widespread and
growing problem across America.....
<p>
A climate of fear and intimidation can hardly support learning. If
students are distracted from their studies, or stay home to avoid
becoming victims, it stands to reason they will do more poorly in
school......
<p>
Grogger used careful statistical tools to distinguish the effects of
school violence from other school or social problems that may hinder
student success. For example, he didn't want to blame school violence
for high dropout rates if neighborhood poverty was really to blame for
both......
<p>
He also found that teachers commanded battle-pay premiums as the price
of working at disorderly schools. Teacher salaries were 7 percent
higher at schools with serious violence problems, compared to salaries
at the least violent schools, again accounting for other factors.
<p>
Grogger's bottom line: Curbing school violence could have a much more
profound effect on student performance than reducing class sizes or
hiring teachers with graduate credentials.''
<p>
<hr>
<p>
School violence is a subject of concern, especially for people who
have to be inside those schools. As a high school teacher, I
personally feel like becoming violent, off and on, in response to the
stressful conditions. So far, I've staved off the urge to get
"physical" with an insolent or threatening student. Violence is very
foreign to me, as I was raised in a pretty benign environment. Still,
working in a high school, I've become inured to a certain level of
violence, and so have the students and faculty around me....sometimes
more and sometimes less than I have. I have met, and heard stories of,
teachers who left a particular school, or who left teaching altogether
because of an incident, an atmosphere, an injury. I know three male
teachers, well into their 60s, who were all hurt risking their
physical safety to prevent a group of students from further assaulting
each other. As a rule, students get in fights with each other; it is
hard for a responsible adult not to get involved even if it is
injudicious to do so.
<p>
Rather than itemize the variety of things I've witnessed, let one
example suffice. Two windows in my classroom were shot out while I was
teaching my first period class. I called security, and the students
crawled around on the floor looking for evidence. Besides being an
outrage, it was interesting to watch both students' and teachers'
responses to this unsolved attack. The next day, I inquired of a
student, whose mother also works at our school, what her mother had
said about the episode. The student said she hadn't mentioned it to
her mother. Was she afraid to frighten her mother? Did she truly feel
it wasn't newsworthy? Don't they speak? I insisted a school counselor
come to the class to help process the experience. It was many days
later, and the counselor was almost an hour late. The kids had little
to say.
<p>
Several teachers, to whom I personally related the incident, swore I
had never told them when I raised the topic at a teachers' meeting (if
I hadn't brought it up, it wouldn't have been common knowledge.) Did
those couple of teachers forget the information because it wasn't
really processed in
the first place? Was I in a total muddle and hadn't told them? Do we
hear lots of `stories' inside a school which we don't have the
emotional energy and the literal time to remember? I know, myself, I
hear bits and pieces of stories and then I am rushing on to the next
difficult task and the information is something of a swill. This
facilitates the denial which is part and parcel of working in a
sometimes violent environment.
<p>
Jeff Grogger's research indicates that these schools where violence is
a problem must pay their teachers higher salaries to keep them there.
Probably this is true; however, my experience is that teachers in more
affluent school districts face less violence and are paid better. I
suspect this varies, but the point that struck me while reading his
article is that he is definitely thinking in "price system" solutions.
In fact, he is assuming we should try to keep teacher's pay down to
save money for some other purpose. My response is also a "price
system" response, "I am already underpaid! How can he suggest wanting
to pay less!?" This could put us into the thick of a pointless
argument --  one about how there is not enough to go around, and
whether I should get more by proving myself somehow more worthy, or
more endangered, or more highly qualified. Let's not waste our energy!
<p>
At the end of the article, Grogger specifically weighs how money could
be best allocated. He suggests we use it to curb school violence
rather "than reducing class size or hiring teachers with graduate
credentials." (Let us never forget, though, that animal studies show a
very direct connection between crowding and violence).
<p>
Why can't we do ALL these things? What is more important than
education? In this profit-driven society, plenty of things are more
important than education, except for the education of a few, well-to-
do, well-connected students. What a shame!
<p>
Still, I want to give Mr. Grogger credit for pointing a finger,
drawing a red circle around "violence in our schools." It is there.
Look at it. Schools struggle to keep down the numbers of suspensions
for violent infractions, because it looks bad (You might get
reconstituted!). Besides, we reassure ourselves, suspending students
doesn't solve the problem. No, it doesn't. But being in a fog and
arguing over resources doesn't solve the problem, either.
<p>
Finally, Grogger has spent much time and energy trying to separate the
causes of school failure. Jonathan Marshall writes that Grogger, "used
careful statistical tools to distinguish the effects of school
violence from other school or social problems that may hinder student
success." Is it violence? Poverty? "Other social problems?" I suspect
you can't tease too many of those causes apart, as they are so
interrelated. And even if we could neatly subdivide and analyze each
cause, we are still left with the gross situation: Many students are
failing to get a decent education. Jails are waiting. Dead-end jobs
are waiting. Welfare isn't waiting quite as much as it was last year.
Violence plays its part, and will so, increasingly.
<p>
The organization of our society itself is at fault. We need to
dissipate the fog and get on with the work of reorganizing our
society. Technocracy offers its social design as a starting place.
