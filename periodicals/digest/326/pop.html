 Science and Population Growth
<p>
The human race has a long history of ignorance, superstition,
violence, and unwarranted self-esteem, based almost entirely on the
beliefs, opinions, habits, and traditions in vogue. It is only in
recent history that humans have been able to replace a very limited
number of these concepts by using scientific methods of factual
investigations. Even with these new concepts being allowed in only
limited areas, science has revolutionized the means whereby people
live; science has done more transformation than all the politicians,
economists, and philosophers in past history, combined. This
revolution has been so successful that the industrialization of the
production process has been almost completely transformed from a
hand-tool, low-energy operation, to a highly mechanized,
computer-controlled, mass-production process. This should have been of
great benefit to the population. Unfortunately, it has been a process
that has depleted the natural resources and habitat on an
unprecedented scale. 
<p>
This new industrial capacity has allowed the human population to grow
from one billion to six billion in the past 200 years, with a present
growth rate projection of another billion per decade. At the same
time, on average, living standards have been higher than ever before --
until the past three decades. This exponential growth has been made
possible only by a similar exponential growth in the use of the
earth's natural resources, using far more efficient production
methods. Can this type of growth be continued?
<p>
The business man says yes; he needs more customers.
<p>
The politician says yes; he needs more voters, and money from
business.
<p>
The philosopher says yes; it's morally wrong to limit population.
<p>
The scientists have said little -- until years of study provided
factual information from which to reach a conclusion. How can the most
accurate conclusion be reached? Consider the following:
<p>
Few people are prepared to face up to the population growth causing
environmental, economic, and political problems for modern society on
this, or any other, continent. The earth's population reached its
first billion about the year 1800, after slowly growing from the
beginning of the species. In the space of the 200 years, from 1800 to
2000, the population will have increased to six billion. By the use of
technological methods, powered by fossil fuels, the ability to produce
the requirements of life has made this increase possible. As the
population grows, so must the ability to supply the necessities of
life. Without the exponential growth in the use of the earth's
resources, the exponential growth of the population could never have
occurred.
<p>
We do not eat, wear, or live on ideals -- in spite of their influence
on the behavior patterns of the past. We eat food grown in the earth's
arable soil, fish grown in the earth's waters, and we wear clothes and
live in dwellings made from the earth's resources. Even the air we
breathe is an earth-resource, necessary for life. Without these things
we couldn't live at all. Therefore, these are the most important
components in existence -- far more important than any political or
economic ideals.
<p>
Throughout human history, humans have been chiefly concerned with
their personal problems: those of their families, and the local
operations of their society. This was sufficient, perhaps, for a hand-
tool, low-energy society without modern population densities or
resource-depletion.
<p>
However, the time has arrived when the exponential growth in the use
of the earth's resources, to support such a population growth, is
rapidly reaching heights impossible to maintain, and is adding to the
fields of interest about which we must be concerned.
<p>
For example, consider oil; oil is a non-renewable resource. When it
has all been used, there will be no more. At present, we are using oil
by the cubic mile, and this rate can not be continued into the distant
future. If the human species is to survive, these things must be
considered.
<p>
Not only oil and population need consideration. Many other things are
involved with human life and must occupy our thoughts, as well.
Further, only factual information should be considered, as this
subject is entirely too important to rely on beliefs and opinions or
political rhetoric. In order to demonstrate what we mean, let us
examine a factual method by which we can most accurately determine the
earth's ability to feed the increasing population:
<p>
The earth has some 57.6 million square miles of land area, including
Antarctica and all significant islands, as well as the continents. At
640 acres per square mile, that would be almost 37 billion acres. Of
this total, only three-to-three-and-one-half billion acres are arable
soil to provide the food crops for the earth's present six billion
people. This means that there are only five-tenths to six-tenths of an
acre per capita. Since, on average, one to 1.1 acres is required to
adequately sustain one person, it is obvious that the earth is already
over-populated. This, plus the unequal distribution of purchasing
power, explains why some 1.2 billion people live in extreme poverty,
are ill-nourished, with many actually starving.
<p>
Now, after absorbing the above, consider that, presently, the
population is increasing by 88 million per year, and that the earth's
supply of arable soil is being damaged by erosion and mismanagement at
an annual rate equal in size to the State of Wyoming, and that 2.471
acres) of this are being severely damaged. Five million hectares is
equal in size to the States of New Hampshire and Vermont combined.
(For further information see
<a href="http://www.worldwatch.org/pubs/paper/131.html">Worldwatch #131</a>)
<p>
Under such conditions, how long can the population continue to double
each 46 years? Can anyone be so nave as to believe that the earth's
resources can support one person per square foot of arable soil? It
should be obvious to any normal person that these trends can't be
continued.
<p>
Unfortunately, even the United States is not immune from the physical
limits of growth. From August 1995 to August 1996, the U.S. population
grew by 2,413,000. Further urban sprawl, new golf courses, and erosion
have been continued --  with little thought about the future needs for
agriculture. The amount of arable soil per capita in the U.S. has
dropped from 4.15 acres in 1933 to less than 1.9 acres in 1996,
chiefly due to population increases.
<p>
New highways, parking lots, shopping malls, urban development, golf
courses, and erosion, continue at a faster pace, as the population
increases. At the present rate of growth, the earth's population will
double in 46 years. (See Population Reference Bureau) And, at the
present rate of deterioration, in the same 46 years, the world's
arable soil will be reduced by an amount 46 times the annual rate
shown above. SO --  without drastic improvements, a complete disaster
should be expected during the next 46 years. The present rate of
starvation indicates that this disaster has already started.
<p>
In this real world of matter and energy, it is a physical
impossibility to maintain, endlessly, such an exponential rate of
growth. Even a financial world, if somewhere based on physical
reality, must have similar limitations. The federal debt in the U.S.,
since 1933, has grown by 222.2 times. The interest payments on that
debt has grown by 339.2 times during this same period of time.
<p>
The debt itself is not based on any physical law; it has no reality in
the physical world; therefore it is not subject to any physical
limitations. The interest on this debt is in the same boat, except it
must be paid from the purchasing power of the public. This reduces the
living standard and the ability to purchase the goods and services
which help to provide the jobs and the purchasing power, in the first
place. When we add in the interest payments on all the total U.S.
debt, including the federal debt, it now requires almost half of all
working hours in order to make these payments.
<p>
The "social costs" of living, plus interest payments, is already
beyond the ability to pay. As a result, we have a mountain range of
debt that extends from shining sea to shining sea. The federal debt
alone is $5.3 trillion, and increasing by almost a billion dollars per
day. We are not only digging an ever-deeper environmental hole for
ourselves, but also an equally devastating financial hole, as well.
<p>
If the environmental movement thought it would have any chance of
achieving a sustainable physical environment for the human species, it
would also have to think how to achieve a sustainable economic
environment. An informed scientific evaluation would show that this is
an impossibility.
<p>
Environmentalists often suggest that the costs of environmental
degradation should be reflected in the GNP; should be paid as we go,
so to speak. Some of this cost is added to the price of the products
and services when business must pay for cleanups, along with all the
other costs of doing business. When health problems result from
environmental degradation, they are partially recovered by doctor and
hospital bills. When a building must be repainted because acid rain
has damaged the paint, some of the costs are "recovered" by painters
and paint manufacturers. All this adds a bit to the number of jobs for
people.
<p>
However, only a small fraction of the total costs of environmental
deterioration is recovered in this manner. Much of the cost is
postponed to some future date. For example, consider the time when the
earth's oil is depleted to un-economic levels, what will the cost be
to solve this problem? When there is no longer enough arable soil to
support a continued expansion of population levels, and starvation
increases accordingly, will there be a way to pay, in money, for this?
Will it be paid by adding to the present debt? Or will it be paid for
by the loss of life required to bring population levels into balance
with the ability of the earth's resources to support them? Or will it
be some combination of both?
<p>
There have been some important and successful efforts made on behalf
of the environment. However, these successes have been rendered far
less effective by the rapid population increase. Further, they have
become less effective as some people find their bread better buttered
with money if they work against such projects. Obviously, integrity
and intestinal fortitude are both required to be an honest
environmentalist.
<p>
Scientists are humans with the same desires, human needs, and ego
problems as anyone else. The difference is that they have been trained
to accept verifiable information, at least in their own field of
expertise. Environmental scientists, for example, have carefully
investigated the ecological conditions in which mankind must live.
Much is yet to be learned, but much has already been learned. The
book, "Road to Survival" by William Vogt, and "The Ecology of Man," by
Wilton Ivie, both published in 1948, are proof that this field of
science is at least 50 years old. Environmental scientists do not
claim that they are always correct, but since their work is always
subject to review by other scientists, the chance of their accuracy is
far greater than that of any other group or individual.
<p>
We would do well to investigate the motives of lobbyists and
politicians who try to lull the public into believing that
environmental conditions are not approaching a danger point. We may
find that such attempts may prove to be social treason.
<p>
What are the changes necessary for the survival of the human species?
<ol>
  <li>Population growth must be reversed and become a negative growth.
  <li>A balance between population and the earth's ability to supply
      human needs on a long-range basis must be achieved.
  <li>The physical environment must be conserved for the benefit of
      future generations.
  <li>The citizens of this Continent (and elsewhere) MUST make a serious
      effort to learn to select a leadership which has some understanding of
      the physical requirements of life and how they can be provided.
  <li>The monetary motivation, which provides the incentive for an ever
      more rapid destruction of the environment, must be replaced by methods
      which provide the incentive for conservation.
</ol>
<p>
Number 5 is, perhaps, the most difficult of all the necessary
requirements for human survival. It will require the most widespread
use of the greatest number of intelligent people of any social change
in human history. At this point in history, it is quite uncertain that
this human characteristic is present in sufficient quantities. It
certainly wasn't during the 1930s depression when it was so obvious
that something was seriously out of balance --
when food was destroyed while people were hungry. (We still do this).
<p>
To further complicate matters, a point-of no-return could be reached
in environmental deterioration beyond which the condition could never
be corrected. With present exponential growth in so many areas now
reaching impossible heights, this could happen very quickly; and
perhaps, without recognition until too late.
<p>
There can be no hope for the future of the human species if so many
people continue to refuse to consider the environmental and economic
deterioration now in progress. The world desperately needs some
country, or continent, to solve its physical and economic problems in
order to set an example for others to follow. To date, no such example
exists.
<p>
Here we are, a species threatened with extinction, or very close to
it, hurtling headlong, full steam ahead, with little purpose except to
make money. How sad it is that future historians, if any, must record
the breakdown of the nearest thing to a civilization yet to exist on
this earth, because of a shortage of intestinal fortitude.
