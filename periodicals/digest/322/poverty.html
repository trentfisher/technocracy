POVERTY has many meanings. The Concise Oxford Dictionary
lists these: Being poor, indigence, want, scarcity, deficiency,
inferiority, poorness, meanness. And a Poverty-line is a minimum
income level needed to get necessities of life.
</BLOCKQUOTE><HR>
<p>
<EM>The Encyclopaedia Britannica, c1966, devotes three
pages to a description of poverty. (We also consulted the Britannica
c1995, and although its explanatory text has been `downsized', poverty
still has the same meaning.) We quote a few of these: ``Poverty may
be defined as an insufficiency of the material necessities of life.
This is not a very exact definition because the necessities of one
society may be luxuries in another and unknown in a third. The idea of
insufficiency is likewise difficult to fix with precision. Some
writers distinguish between poverty as the normal condition of the
poorest stratum of a population, and indigence as a crisis caused by
the interruption of income.
</EM>
<p>
``...The range of want is bounded at one end by literal starvation,
a common phenomenon throughout the world in earlier times and one that
still occurs with appalling frequency in underdeveloped regions and in
the wake of war. At the other extreme of the range, poverty may be
merely a failure to achieve the expected level of living in a
particular society at a particular time. Since the level of living of
technically advanced countries rises steadily, there are many
inconsistencies of time and place.
<p>
``...Regardless of variations in the phenomenon of
poverty, there are two important things which may be said about it:
<p>
``First, the penalties of poverty are always
severe. Compared with their contemporaries, the poor appear always to
have shorter lives, more illness, more physical and mental defects,
more personal crises, less education, less opportunity for
improvement, and less protection from hazards.
<p>
``Second, it appears plainly that the economic progress of advanced
societies in the past few centuries has tended to mitigate poverty by
abolishing famine and raising the minimum level of living which
society will tolerate. Although many doubts have been expressed as to
the ultimate value of this economic progress, it is absurd to deny its
existence. There is hardly any useful commodity whose per capita
consumption has not increased in a spectacular way in the last
century. In the more industrialized countries of the world, attention
has shifted almost completely from the age-old problem of finding
enough food for the population to the new problem of furnishing every
family with automobiles and refrigerators and even in many of the most
backward and overcrowded agricultural regions, the increase of
productivity and the improvement of transportation have made it
<EM>technically possible to protect everyone from hunger.</EM>
<p>
``Despite these favourable omens, the majority of the world's
families in mid-20th century were still desperately poor compared
with the average family of North America or Europe. The <EM>first
result of a secure food supply is a violent increase in
population;</EM> consequently, there is sometimes a decline, rather
than an advance of living standards, in the presence of
increasing social wealth. Although the semistarvation which was normal
throughout past history is now comparatively rare, it is estimated
that half of the human race still subsists predominantly on coarse
grains, and that at least seven-tenths do not have a nutritionally
adequate diet.
<p>
``... A primitive economic system, without much use
of non-human energy, may nevertheless be able to provide a fairly
high level of living if the density of population is low and there is
an abundance of arable land and other natural resources.
<p>
``... Individual poverty in the prosperous
countries may be said to be well on the way to solution. However, many
residual problems remain. Pensions and welfare payments tend to be
meagre when first established and to become more so with time as they
lag behind changes in the price level. In the United States
especially, the high cost of medical services creates a special
category of hardship. The piecemeal nature of most welfare programs
and the prevailing sentiment that public welfare benefits should be
kept at a low level means in practice that although starvation has
been abolished, misery is often perpetuated.''
<p>
That about sums it up. One exception is their statement:
``Individual poverty....well on the way to solution.'' If this
project was ever started, it certainly was never carried to the end.
Over the years, more poverty has been inflicted on people, reaching an
enormity in these days of downsizing. And, of course, downsizing is
the result of more technology being used in the work places --
technology, which, originally, was supposed to free us from toil and
give us more leisure time. However, in this present social system,
where Price governs one's activities, many of us cannot afford to have
leisure when there is no work for pay, as we need that cash to provide
necessities for living.
<p>

The Price System is the interference

Yes, poverty is a terrible thing. It creates such terror and fear
and shame and humiliation in men, women, and children. With little
money coming into the home, it is painfully difficult for young people
with families to survive a marriage. When they have to worry about
putting food on the table, paying their rent or taxes to keep a roof
over their heads, and scratching and scrimping and wondering if
their is any way out of poverty for their children, it is a wonder
they can keep their sanity, let alone a marriage. Many of them feel
they are failures when they see that their children are not getting
the education that could make a successful and happier life for them.
How many hopes and dreams -- even in years past -- have been
shattered by poverty. There is much talk now about this generation
losing ``family values''. It is extremely difficult to hold a
family together when it is assailed and buffeted in a society which
holds money as a god.
<p>
It appears that, for over 60 years, Technocracy has been the only
organization trying to protect children from an abysmal future.
<p>
Also, there is another poverty that people don't seem to realize will
affect everyone, whether they have money stashed away in a bank or
not, and that is the depleting air, water, and soil to grow food.
<p>
In this magazine, we address the reasons for all types of poverty, and
we show that there is absolutely no need for any of it. There has been
a ``poverty in the minds'' of people that this educational
Organization of Technocracy has found most difficult to convince: that
there is a solution to eradicate poverty; that a very high standard of
living can be provided for every citizen of North America; that we can
all enjoy good food, clean air, potable water, a fine education, and
good health, <EM>if we take immediate steps to install a new social
system.</EM>  This Continental area belongs to all of us. Who said
everyone should not have equal opportunities, and share in the bounty
this Continent has to offer in the way of generous health care,
education, food, and shelter? We must not sit back and say,
``there's nothing we can do.''
<p>
The Social Design Technocracy suggests, could even be an example for
other parts of the world to follow, which would also raise their
standards of living.
<p>
All it takes is the realization that it is not a fantasy that we
should, and can, have these high standards; they are within our grasp,
but we have to unite in a demand for a change. It would mean the
abolition of the present Price System which, of course, is our only
interference. Are we going to let the useless, meaningless paper and
coins of a monetary system stop us from having a prosperous, healthy,
and peaceful life?
