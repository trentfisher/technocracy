In his article, <EM>``American Inequality: Its History and Scary
Future,'' New York Times,</EM> December 19, 1995, Benjamin
Schwarz contends that our future is scary.
<p>
Schwarz reports that never have Americans had
equality of incomes. Technocracy concurs. According to Schwarz, a
small improvement, to a limited amount of people, in the
differentiation of income, occurred from 1910 to 1929. Some would
argue -- and rightly so -- that it was better than anything
before or since. Schwarz contends that, while the anti-poverty
programs of the 1960s lessened the downward drift somewhat, it did not
equal the 1910 to 1929 period.
<p>
Schwarz states that for the past 25 years, blue
collar labour had declined as a percentage of the work force.
Consequently, low-paying service jobs increased as a percentage of
the work force. Furthermore, technology and the re-engineered
workplace have eliminated the overall need for many
``low-skilled'' jobs. This, in effect, adds to the problem
that our entire work force cannot be employed -- some are
unemployable. In addition, recently, one onerous result was
noticeable: the differentiating of income favors a larger percentage
of the high income group at the expense of the low income group.
<p>
There is little -- or perhaps better stated --
no chance of the trend of jobs lost being reversed, ``unless
America produces fewer unskilled workers,'' using Schwarz's words.
That's not likely. The problem of the entire work force not being
employable will only intensify. The situation looks bleak. The
differentiating of income in which a larger percentage goes to the
high income group at the expense of the low income group will
continue.
<p>
Schwarz contends that up until lately, social programs have smoothed
the rough edges and, to a small -- very small -- degree,
benefited all classes. Now, the system itself does not operate in the
interest of all parties. It is selective. While current measures are
making no drastic changes in the system, they halt, however, any move
whatsoever that would start a move to equality. Equality is not
possible in a Price System -- it doesn't work like that.
<p>
Schwarz further contends that, ``If Americans want
what they have never had -- the kind of equality Tocqueville
described -- then they should recognize that only radical measures
can bring it about.'' Radical measures, indeed!
<p>
Sadly, Schwarz has no solution of any substance to
offer, radical measures, or otherwise. He suggests a $170 billion per
year program of retraining and educating people. In today's political
climate of spending reductions in Congress' futile attempt to balance
the budget, Schwarz's suggestion is dead in its tracks. It's a dud.
Moreover, if people are trained for jobs, where are the jobs? They
just don't exist. Futility, futility, futility.
<p>
Schwarz articulates well the unequal economic conditions which extend
far into the past and the increasing inequality now in process. His
statement that if trends are to change, ``radical measures''
will be necessary, is well put. Pathetically, he offers none.
(Parenthetically, Technocracy does.)
<p>
North Americans must realize that inequality of income has been a
standard way of life throughout humankind's history. Throughout
history, it could not have been any different, for the simple reason
that enough to fill the needs and amenities of all could not be
produced. Some had to do without. A way had to be found to decide who
would get how much of what. That was the pre-ordained fate in
which most got little.
<p>
The methods of distribution in the past were designed for scarcity
conditions which required everything to have a ``price''.
Therefore, those who could pay the ``price'' got; others did
without. This system, which Technocracy calls a ``Price
System,'' worked relatively well in scarcity conditions. It is
doubtful if any other system would have worked as well.
<p>
Only recently has one spot on earth -- North
America -- become able to produce enough for its citizens.
Ironically, this made another huge problem for North America. The
design of our social economic structure -- our Price System --
is such that it runs into a serious dilemma when goods are produced in
abundance. For a solution, ``radical measures'' are required. In
the remedy, nothing can have a monetary value. In other words, the
Price System must be dumped. A new system must come into effect, where
everything is distributed, and nobody does without.
<p>
When one talks about ``equal distribution of goods
and nobody doing without,'' inevitably the idea conjures up
morality considerations. When Technocracy talks about this matter,
morality is never considered. Technocracy's standpoint: since physical
goods can be produced adequately, equal availability of goods is not a
desire; it's a physical necessity. Technocracy's stand has nothing to
do with morality or virtue; its members are not purists.
<p>
No group has ``radical measures'' that measure up to
Technocracy's. Its Technological Design is as radical as they come.
