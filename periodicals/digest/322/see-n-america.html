<h3>What Is It To You?</h3>
<blockquote><EM>``No man is an Iland, intire of it selfe; everyman is
a peece of the Continent, a part of the Maine, if a clod be washed
away by the Sea, Europe is the lesse, as well as if a Promontorie
were, as well as if a Mannor of thy Friends or of Thine Owne were; any
mans Death diminishes Me, because I am involved in Mankinde; and
therefore never send to know for whom the Bell tolls;  it tolls for
thee.''   (John Donne (1573-1613) English poet and preacher.)
</EM></blockquote>

<h3>Am I My Country's Keeper? </h3>
<p>
Have you ever seen a pine forest after it had been swept by fire, with
its bare, charred trunks standing black against the sky?  Have you
ever seen an abandoned coal mine, topped by a ghost town that once
flourished with life, activity, warmth? Have you ever seen a wheat
field on the prairie after wind and hail had flattened it into a
twisted mess; or a field of potatoes that had been dug up and left to
freeze and rot on the ground?
<p>
There is no joy in these sights. But, there is
something else. What is it to you?
<p>
Put yourself in the position of a Doctor who has a
patient with a strange new malady. Connecting bands of tissue are
drawn tight, shutting off circulation at many points in the patient's
body. In the hand a metal coin is clasped so tightly that the fingers
are turning blue, and useless. Suppose that medical history records no
similar case. There is no precedent to follow in treatment. A
scientific, workable plan is presented but the Doctor cannot adopt it.
What stands in his way? Lack of consent and cooperation by the
patient's guardian.
<p>
There is no joy in a sight like this either. But,
there is something else. What is it to you?
<p>
You are the guardian of North America. It, too, is
sick unto death. Improper circulation is at fault. The flow lines of
goods, through production and distribution, must be opened.
Irreplaceable natural resources are wasting away, dangerously.
Technocracy offers a solution. Will you, the guardian of this land,
give your consent to open these vital flow lines?
<p>
What is to you? It's what it is to your country. Only
a matter of security or insecurity; special privileges or equal
opportunity; abundance or scarcity; civilization or fascism; life or
death; Science or Chaos. That's all!
<p>
Passive consent is worthless. Active assistance is
imperative. Join Technocracy, the only organization with a scientific,
workable design for the functional operation of the North American
Continent.
