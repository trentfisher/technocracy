<HR><BLOCKQUOTE>
In so many of our articles, we mention the ``Price
System'' as a system that interferes with the prosperity and
welfare of citizens on the North American Continent. We are asked many
questions about this, and what we would do about it, so here are a few
answers.
</BLOCKQUOTE><HR>
<h3>What does Technocracy mean by a Price System? </h3>
<p>
Technocracy defines a Price System as any system
whatsoever which effects the distribution of its goods and services on
a basis of commodity evaluation, and which employs any form of debt
tokens or money.
<p>
By this definition, every major society in the world today employs a
Price System, whether they call it capitalism, communism, socialism or
by any other label. Whatever their form, all were geared to conditions
of natural <EM>scarcity,</EM> and hence are unsuitable for
distributing <EM>abundance.</EM>
<p>
<h3>What does Technocracy propose to substitute for the
Price System?</h3>
<p>
Technocracy proposes: first, a carefully planned
production adjusted so as to maintain as high a physical standard of
living for the people of North America as is compatible with the
limitations of non-replaceable natural resources; secondly, a
carefully planned distribution, based upon the total amount of energy
consumed in production. This two-fold plan would give to each
individual an equal and substantial income.
<p>
<h3>What can we do to stop the terrible waste of our
natural resources and still keep the Price System going?</h3>
<p>
Nothing, because the two go hand in hand. The
character of the Price System requires that it constantly expand in
order to survive, and this, in turn, requires a mindless drain of
resources to satisfy the production needs of the revered Gross
National Product. To cut back on the use of resources would
necessitate a decline in the GNP, and hence, in the fortunes of Price
System operation.
<p>
Conservation of our natural resources to any
meaningful extent would soon wreck the Price System; but is that so
bad, in view of the alternative? For the first time, mankind can look
forward to an age of prosperity, but some people still yearn for the
past.
<p>
<h3>What does Technocracy propose to substitute for money?</h3>
<p>
Energy Accounting. Technocracy proposes to replace
money in all of its various forms such as: coin, currency, bank
drafts, cheques, credit cards, etc., with a non-fluctuating medium
of distribution. Instead of having an elastic type of `value' as at
present, goods in a Technate would possess a measurable energy cost,
and would be distributed on that basis. Thus, the total cost of all
goods and services produced would be the total amount of energy used
in their production.
<p>
An individual's consuming power, which would be his/her pro rata share
of all the non-human energy used in producing goods and services,
would be issued to him/her in some form of non-negotiable Energy
card. It would be identified only to the person issued and would be
usable only by him or her. There would be no point in `saving', for
they would all be cancelled out at two-year intervals, and
replaced with new allotments.
<p>
<h3>Does Technocracy envisage the collapse of the Price
System in the near future?</h3>
<p>
Technocracy will not make a flat prediction on this
subject. Too many qualifying factors are involved. For example, a
major war would inject another huge blood transfusion into the Price
System.
<p>
What we can say is that the problems of the Price
System are multiplying daily, and more and more people are becoming
intolerant of this wasteful and obsolete method of social operation.
<p>
<h3>What percentage of the North American population,
demanding social change, would be required to put an end to the Price
System?</h3>
<p>
Social change often comes regardless of man's wishes
or demands. The advance of technology will bring an end to the Price
System, whether we say yea or nay.
<p>
However, Technocracy would welcome a mandate by two-thirds of the
North American population in favor of a Technocratic society. This
mandate could be in the form of a referendum or plebiscite.
<p>
<h3>You say the politicians don't know the answers to our
problems, but apparently we can't vote for you. Who, then, can get us
out of the present mess?</h3>
<p>
What we have said is that Technocracy Inc. will never
operate as a political party and field candidates who solicit votes
for themselves. However, our Organization has frequently stated that
it would welcome a plebiscite or referendum in favor of a Technate.
Since we are a research and educational Organization, we could help
direct the citizens of North America out of the present `mess.' When
that was done, Technocracy Inc. would disband.
<p>
<h3>The Scientific Answer</h3>
<p>
Energy accounting is the only instrument of
distribution that can be used in this Continent's emerging era of
abundance. This provides the accounting means whereby North American
citizens can express their individual preference as to what they want
of the products North America is capable of producing. That is its
function: to record the demand for goods and services and, thereby,
determine the amount to be produced.
<p>
By applying one specific technological measuring device, production
and consumption can be balanced, and the first specification for
social harmony is immediately achievable.
<p>
The elimination of the Price System and installation of a Technate
will automatically remove many problems which are natural concomitants
of our present method of social operation.
