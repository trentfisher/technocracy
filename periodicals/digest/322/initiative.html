<h3>THERE IS A DIFFERENCE!</h3>
<p>
One of the specifications in Technocracy's design of a new social
structure calls for the distribution of the potential abundance of
this Continent to all its inhabitants. That, of course, is a major
essential.
<p>
The successful operation and continuation of our high-energy
civilization requires that we must all enjoy complete social and
economic security, in the widest sense of the term, with a very high
standard of living.
<p>
But that objective is not the be-all and end-all of human
existence. Standards of living, and degrees of security, are relative
terms, depending upon the nature of our environment, the extent of our
resources and the efficiency with which we are able to convert them
into use forms. No order of society can remain static. It must advance
or retrogress in accordance with its environment. It is unlikely that
the human race will ever be able to say of any type of society, `this
is it; this is the ultimate to which people may aspire.'
<p>
Technocracy therefore does not pretend to designate an ultimate form
of existence, beyond which we cannot advance or upon which we cannot
improve. On the contrary, it includes another specification and
requisite in its design which calls for the widest possible leeway for
the expression of individual initiative, in order to forestall social
and industrial stagnation.
<p>
<h3>HERE WE ARE NOW -- AT INITIATIVE</h3>
<p>
Initiative is inherent in normal people, but often
remains latent today because it is largely stifled under the pressure
of the effort to achieve some slight measure of economic security in
the financial world -- the Price System. A society which will
endure and flourish must encourage the full expression of that normal
urge which today is either submerged, or is developed along lines that
are socially undesirable, and upon objectives that are detrimental to
the general welfare.
<p>
In an economy founded upon the distribution of abundance to all
citizens, the <EM>chiselling type of initiative</EM>, which is
characteristic and mandatory under the <EM>incentives</EM> of the
Price System, would be regarded as a disease and would entitle its
victims to treatment in a mental institution.
<p>
<h3>HERE IS INCENTIVE -- THE NOBLE KIND</h3>
<p>
We should bear in mind that our present complex
civilization, especially as it exists on this Continent, has been made
possible by the <EM>initiative</EM>  of a comparative handful of
people whose <EM>incentive</EM> has been the search of the answer
to the age-old question, `How?' Their achievements are reflected
in every phase of our complicated modern civilization. `Never did so
many owe so much to so few.'
<p>
The dominating <EM>incentive</EM> behind
technological progress is, and always has been, curiosity. When we
read of the lives and works of past and present scientists, we realize
that they were motivated by an overwhelming and devouring curiosity.
<p>
<h3>WEALTH,  NOT  NECESSARILY  THE DOMINATING  INCENTIVE</h3>
<P>
They were not necessarily high-minded
individuals. Some of them were almost objectionable in their personal
habits, and most of them displayed the weaknesses of ordinary people.
Some of them carried on their investigations while seriously
handicapped by lack of funds, in the face of ridicule, indifference,
jealousy, and even some form of persecution. Others were not hampered
by any want of the material things and comforts of life. In either
case, it is apparent that the acquisition of wealth was not the
dominating <EM>incentive </EM>in their life work.
<p>
People have sacrificed their time, their health, and even their lives
in devotion to some form of research, such as the isolation of a
microbe, responsible for some particular disease, and the serum for
its eradication. Pasteur gave the last 38 years of his life to the
study of bacteriology, particularly as applied to the cure and
prevention of animal diseases, such as anthrax, rabies, and cholera.
Walter Reed devoted his short life of 50 years to the successful
eradication of yellow fever, and a grateful country granted his widow
an annual pension of $1,500.
<p>
In any form of Price System operation, many people are forced to spend
the greater part of their time and energy in scraping up their daily
needs. The problem of ensuring themselves some slight degree of
security demands most of their attention. Little time and opportunity
is available for the display of <EM>initiative</EM> in the fields
of science, art, or recreation. Most of their spare hours are spent in
some form of escapism, such as the various thrills of the television
programs -- their soap operas, movies, sports -- by which they
seek to forget the worries that have plagued them during the day, and
the problems which will most likely face them tomorrow.
<p>
Most people are too uninterested, bewildered, and exhausted to give
much thought to the welfare of their neighbors, their country, or
mankind in general. They remain content to delegate to others, who may
be, and often are, less competent than themselves, the task of solving
our social, economic, and international difficulties, instead of
recognizing their own responsibility.
<p>
Even those who are, to a greater or lesser extent, removed from the
sordid struggle for existence, are, for the most part, too conditioned
by the rules of the game through which they have reached their
preferred position. They are too occupied in consolidating and
insuring the continuation of their happy circumstance; too engrossed
in doing all they can to perpetuate the established order of things,
to devote any time or thought to the basic factors which prescribe
poverty, drudgery, and despair to millions of their fellow men, women,
and children, and which will eventually undermine the very foundations
of their own security.
<p>
When the inexorable pressure of events forces people to strike off the
shackles of price and politics, we shall see the inauguration of a new
era in the lives of citizens.
<p>
The wonderful advances we have made during the last
50 years, will be as nothing compared with the progress we may
anticipate in the next 50 years. An adequate system of education,
available to all, will provide the opportunity of expression to the
`mute inglorious Miltons' in every field of human endeavor. Our
teachers and educationalists, given a free hand, will institute
methods of instruction which will develop the natural aptitudes latent
in normal children.
<p>
The medical profession will fulfill its high calling
by engendering emulation among its members, directed towards the
prevention of disease and the cure for those few diseases which, so
far, have defied their efforts. There is little doubt that if the best
brains of the medical profession were detailed to cancer research and
were unhampered by lack of funds and equipment, they would, within a
reasonable time, come through with a cure or preventive for that
dreaded scourge. What competition there would be, for the honor of
that accomplishment, and what a monument would be raised in
recognition of those who had a part in it!
<p>
Those of us who are engaged in the every day tasks involved in
Continental operation will be encouraged by the thrill of achievement
in our particular field of work. We will develop real initiative in
seeking new and more efficient ways in carrying out our share of the
performance necessary for the smooth functioning of the social
mechanism.
<p>
Normal people cherish, above all else, the respect and admiration of
their fellows; life gives us no satisfaction comparable to that of
accomplishment. Once we are free from the mean and sordid restrictions
of Price System interference, we may expect to witness extraordinary
advances in every phase of human activity. One would need to be bold
indeed to predict people's ultimate goal.
