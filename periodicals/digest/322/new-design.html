OPEN LETTER TO THE CITIZENS OF NORTH AMERICA:
<p>
<EM>The North American Continent needs every possible
citizen to study and understand the grave conditions -- social,
economic, and environmental -- now present on this Continent and
elsewhere.
</EM>
<p>
Most likely you will, if, and as, your study continues,
find that you will increasingly be able to answer many of the
questions you have asked yourselves for years. Many Technocrats have
found this to be so in their own experience.
<p>
Solutions to North America's major social problems
have been available for more than 60 years, and all citizens who could
read should have been made aware of Technocracy's solutions long ago.
The fact that they haven't can only be due to the planned failure of
the news media and the educational system to present this knowledge.
They have certainly been supplied with this information. To anticipate
an often asked question, the probable time of a transition from this
Price System to a Technate is unanswerable at this time. Although
Technocracy has been surprisingly accurate in its predictions, this
one is so riddled with variables that a prediction can not even be
attempted. The answer depends, for example, on the intelligence
available, how much the public is willing to suffer, how long
information can be withheld by the media, and, of course, how
successful Technocrats are in overcoming the silence of the news media
in informing our fellow citizens concerning this subject.
<p>
We can point out, however, that the U.S. federal debt
is now $5.0 trillion, and increasing at about a quarter of a trillion
per year. We can point out that more than 30 million Americans are
living in poverty, with at least another 30 million only slightly
better off. We can point out that Canada's condition is quite similar.
We can point out that more people than ever before -- including
newspaper columnists, ecologists, and the general public -- are
being forced by the march of events to admit something is not working
properly, and hasn't, even before the great Depression of the 1930s.
<p>
We can also point out that, with a population
increase of nearly 100 million per year, and with the resulting
decline in natural resources, plus the increasing pollution of the
environment, the human species have a limited time available to
reverse these trends. If it is not done soon, a point of no return
will be passed. Then, the best that can be done will be an effort to
postpone an ecological collapse, with no solution possible. Some
ecologists say this time limit will last only through the 1990s.
<p>
<HR><BLOCKQUOTE>
Solutions offered by the methods of science must be started
</BLOCKQUOTE><HR>
<p>
Another anticipated question, ``How well are we prepared to
initiate solutions?'' Not well. However, we must say that
Technocracy is not going to ``Take Charge.'' The solutions
required must be the result of pressure from the public, either as a
result of knowing what is necessary and how to do it, or as a demand
that solutions, offered by the methods of science, be effected. It
could be started in either the United States or Canada, but it will
have to be done, because there is no alternative for survival. We do
not know that a Technate will ever be installed, any more than we know
that the human species can survive the collapse of the present Price
System economy, or the collapse of the physical environment.
<p>
North American citizens are certainly not prepared to
make any major social change. The present ``leadership'' is not
prepared, so how could they prepare us? However all major new ideas
have started from a very few, and possibly, only one human brain, and
it must become widespread from there. Time limits, now being so short,
limit the possibilities. However, we think we have a chance, and since
we know that we haven't a choice, what can we do but try?
