<hr>
People of the world have been fed lies for years about the brave
exploits of many of the generals who led the U.S. forces into wars.
You wonder how many people died needlessly during war when you hear
what they did in peacetime.
<p>
Listen to this:
<p>
We quote from a book published by Crown Publishers of New York, in
1990, called <cite>Don't Know Much About History</cite>,
by Kenneth C. Davis.
<p>
"In the midst of the Depression, buglers called President Hoover and
the First Lady to seven-course dinners, served by a small army of
white-gloved servants. President Hoover thought that keeping up regal
trappings and spiffy appearances was good for national morale.
Outside, Americans were fighting for scraps from garbage cans. But
some `rugged individuals' were going to give Hoover an unpleasant
close look at life on the other side of the Depression fence.
<p>
"In the summer of 1932, The Depression's worst year, 25,000 former
`doughboys' -- World War I infantrymen, many of whom were combat
veterans -- walked, hitch-hiked, or `rode the rods' to Washington,
D.C. Organizing themselves into a penniless, vagrant army, they
squatted, with their families, in abandoned buildings, along
Pennsylvania Avenue, and pitched an encampment of crude shacks and
tents on the banks of the Anacostia River. They had come to ask
Congress to pay them a `Bonus', promised to veterans in 1924, and
scheduled to be paid in 1925. Starving and desperate men, they had
families going hungry, no jobs, and no prospects of finding one. They
needed that bonus to survive. Calling themselves the Bonus
Expeditionary Force (BEF), they were better known as the `Bonus Army.'
<p>
"Their pleas for relief fell on deaf ears. To Hoover, Congress,
lawmen, and the newspapers, these weren't `veterans', but `Red
Agitators.' (Hoover's own Veterans' Administration surveyed the Bonus
Army and found that 95 percent of them were, indeed, veterans.)
<p>
Instead of meeting the BEF's leader, Hoover called out the troops,
commanded by General Douglas MacArthur, with his young aide, Dwight
Eisenhower. The assault was led by the Third Cavalry, sabers ready,
under the command of Major George Patton. Behind the horses, the U.S.
Army rolled out to meet the ragged bunch of men, women, and children
with tear-gas, tanks, and bayonets.
<p>
"Patton's cavalry first charged the Bonus Marchers, now mixed with
curious civilians who were getting off from work on this hot July
afternoon. Following the cavalry charge, came the tear-gas attack,
routing the Bonus Army from Pennsylvania Avenue and across the
Eleventh Street Bridge. Disregarding orders -- a common thread running
through his career -- MacArthur decided to finish the job by
destroying the Bonus Army entirely. After nightfall, the tanks and
cavalry leveled the jumbled camp of tents and packing-crate shacks. It
was all put to the torch. There were more than one hundred casualties
in the aftermath of the battle, including two babies, suffocated by
the gas attack.
<p>
"Pushed out of the Nation's capital, the Bonus Army dissipated,
joining the other two million Americans `on the road'. Some States,
like California, posted guards to turn back the poor. The violence in
Washington, D.C. was the largest but not the only demonstration of a
growing anger and unrest in America. During 1931 and 1932 there had
been a number of riots and protests, mostly by the unemployed and
hungry, sometimes by children, that were put down with harsh police
action."
<p>
Well, well! Generals MacArthur, Eisenhower (after whom Canada re-named
Castle Mountain, one of the Canadian Rockies, much to the disgust of
many Canadians) and Patton -- brave, brave heroes, gaining prestige by
running down veterans of the First World War!
<p>
This book also recounts many sickening events like this, about which
the general public still knows little.
<p>
Canada had its share of demonstrations too; the largest and the most
well-known one was when a large number of unemployed men left
Vancouver on a train, picking up more unemployed at each train stop,
without interruption from any police -- until they reached the
headquarters of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, at Regina,
Saskatchewan -- where they were met with a violent attack by the
police, and were turned back from their trek to Ottawa.
<p>
There have been a few higher-up Commandants and Generals who were
sickened by the politically motivated actions of their peers, and have
exposed them in books they have written.
<p>
One of them was Major General Smedley Butler, who, in 1931, retired,
and eventually became a spokesman for The League Against War &
Fascism. "Take the dollar sign off the battle flags," became the motto
he used as he fought to expose and eliminate the "racist undertones of
Yankee imperialism." In 1935, he wrote a book entitled, "War is a
Racket." In a speech he made, in 1933, he is quoted as saying: "A
racket is best described, I believe, as something that is not what it
seems to the majority of people. Only a small inside group knows what
it is about. It is conducted for the benefit of the very few at the
expense of the masses.
<p>
"I believe in adequate defense at the coastline and nothing else. If a
nation comes over here to fight, then we'll fight. The trouble with
America is that when the dollar only earns six percent over here, then
it gets restless and goes overseas to get 100 percent. Then the flag
follows the dollar and the soldiers follow the flag.
<p>
"I wouldn't go to war again as I have done, to protect some lousy
investment of the bankers. There are only two things that we should
fight for. One is the defense of our homes and the other is the Bill
of Rights. War for any other reason is simply a racket."
<p>
Of course, you probably all remember that, in the middle of World War
II, all the bankers of the world met in Switzerland to discuss
world-wide banking deals. No war for them!
<p>
Perhaps you are not aware of these following treacherous incidents,
either:
<p>
In 1931, Japan invaded Manchuria. The Japanese were never capable of
waging a global war, yet, American, French and British business
continued to deal with the Japanese until 1941 when the United States 
entered the war (that's two years after World War II started,
involving the French, the British, Canada, Australia, et al.)
<p>
In 1934, Germany, under the Nazis, announced to all the world that its
program was a return to conditions preceding the Versailles Treaty,
Anshluss with Austria, and a crusade against Bolshevism. Yet American,
French and British business continued to deal with the Germans,
selling them airplane engines, planes and petroleum, far in excess of
their normal, peacetime requirements, knowing equally well that such
dealings might result in war.
<p>
Just why are wars fought? The following is a quote from the
Congressional Record, Senate, April 15, 1947: "Realistically, all wars
have been for economic reasons. To make them politically and socially
palatable, ideological issues have always been invoked."
<p>
Another quote, from a book by Lawrence Dens: "Wars have become bigger
in cost and deadlier in consequences; ...a war in the middle of the
20th century is serving a purpose of performing social functions such
as maintaining full employment with continuous economic expansion..."
<p>
<p>
Much of the information in this article was researched and printed in
his THREE'S NEWS, by John Taube, a Technocracy member in San
Francisco, plus other research by Technocracy member L. W. Nicholson,
of South Carolina.
<p>
In answer to questions about Technocracy which Taube received on his
E-mail, he wrote that: "Human behavior is dictated by the environment.
History is nothing but wars, wars, and more wars. Can truth, love,
harmony and other imponderables alter the course of humankind?
<p>
<p>
"The answer to the question above is: "No." What can? A technological
society with a social structure that is compatible with modern times
-- a scientific technological age -- can. Why? Because, in such an
arrangement, where there is enough for all to live luxuriously, there
can be truth, love, harmony, etc.
<p>
<p>
For instance, in Alaska, people can all live in truth, love and
harmony in regard to water, but the reverse from our truth, love and
harmony may occur for people in the Sahara Desert, with a shortage of
water, where they might kill each other.
<p>
"The environment dictates behavior.
<p>
"So what the heck do us little people do about this? Little people can
study and understand human behavior, act accordingly, and all of a
sudden, we have a lot of big people."
