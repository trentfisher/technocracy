The Great Seal of the United States, on the reverse side, depicts a
truncated pyramid with an All-Seeing Eye on top and bears the Latin
inscription, Annuit Coeptus Novus Ordo Seclorum. This inscription is
translated as, "Time Makes Way for a New Order of the Ages." This is a
motto of progress and of social change.
<p>
Back in the days of hand tools, human labor, and ever-present
scarcity, it was very difficult to envision a new order of the ages;
but, even then, there were a few visionaries. For example, toward the
end of the 19th century, Edward Bellamy published his book,
<cite>Equality.</cite> He was branded as an imaginative but impractical
"visionary." No one "in his right mind' could accept such ideas as the
Air Car, the Horseless Plow, or the Electroscope (television) of which
he wrote. But by the middle of the 20th century, many of the
inventions and innovations of which Bellamy wrote had become
commonplace. Evidently, Mr. Bellamy had an intuitive awareness of the
direction in which social change would move.
<p>
Evidently, the author of the inscription on the Great Seal, whoever he
may have been, was also a visionary. Although he did not furnish a
blueprint for a New Order, he, at least, presented the idea of its
inevitable occurrence.
<p>
Today, the world is much in need of leadership with vision and wisdom;
and it needs the guidance of men and women who understand technical
matters. As it is, our Continent is jeopardized by the static values
of the golf course, of financial institutions, and of political
offices.
<p>
It is now quite apparent that history has reached the end of an era
and that the world is in transition from an old to a New era. But
visionless leaders, unable, or unwilling, to read the signs of the
times, have been pursuing a road that has no positive ending;
terminating only in the rubble of colossal destruction. There is no
valid long-term reason for out-spending billions of dollars and
risking innumerable human lives just so our businessmen can gain
possession of oil and other resources on the other side of the earth.
<p>
America's basic problem is not on other Continents. It is here also --
on our own home territory -- and it directly concerns the welfare of
our own millions of needy, bewildered people. The time is now due when
America should enter into the New Order which science and technology
have been preparing (wittingly or unwittingly) for us over the past
century.
<p>
North America is richly supplied with abundant material resources and
with the knowledge and machines for turning the materials into usable
goods and services -- into an abundance for all North American
citizens.
<p>
But an abundance, over 98 per cent of which is produced by machine
energy and less than two per cent by human labor (as at present),
cannot be effectively sold or distributed on the basis of wages and
salaries; nor can it permit the continued use of money as a medium of
exchange. Wages and exchange are concepts of a scarcity economy. They
cannot effect distribution of more than a mere fraction of our
potential technological capability to produce.
<p>
Because of the discrepancy between our present production and
distribution, our government is piling up huge `surpluses,' which are
paid for by the people through taxation, but which is denied to them.
These `surpluses' are allowed to rot in storage, are destroyed, or are
dumped in foreign lands while America's own needy, in the millions,
suffer for lack of the things they sorely need but cannot buy. The
United States, today, according to recent reports, has in excess of $1
million, per day, charged up to the taxpayers. In the meantime, at
least one-third of our citizens -- some 60 million of them -- are
ill-fed, ill-housed, and ill-clothed. It is a problem of distribution
which the Price System has not, and cannot, solve.
<p>
What America sorely needs, today, is a medium of distribution rather
than a medium of exchange (money). What we need is a simple and
effective means whereby all citizens of North America may share in
their common heritage. That heritage consists of an abundance of goods
and services.
<p>
The signs of our times indicate that, from now on into the future,
industry will require less and less human labor to produce more and
more. As a consequence, no one will have to work for long hours at
toilsome jobs. The essential work of the Continent will have to be
spread thin so that all citizens will have the opportunity to do their
share. Hence, the future citizens of North America will need to be
employed, at reduced hours and days, for only a few years, in the
younger part of their lives. Then, they shall be retired on full
income for the rest of their lives. That is what the `signs' point to
as a social necessity.
<p>
As it is, millions, both young and old, are being `retired' from
employment without their consent and without pay. Many of them resort
to crime to gain a livelihood. Others enter crime as a simpler way of
getting ahead in the economic system. A recent report of the F.B.I.
places the crime bill at $20 billion. Court records show that about 95
percent of all crime committed in the United States is for money or
other economic gain. This bill must be chargeable to the Price System.
Without money and exchange, but with a high income for all, there
would be little incentive to steal or commit other crimes of an
economic nature. Besides the cost to the nation of crime, in terms of
dollars, there is a high cost in sorrow, suffering, and inconvenience
of the citizens which crime produces. This is all so unnecessary in an
era of abundance.
<p>
Are there any North Americans who would oppose the provision of
abundance for all, including themselves? If there be such, then you
know they are enemies of progress and supporters of poverty, crime,
and strife.
<p>
Abundance would free North America of poverty, the distress of
unemployment, internal strife, and charity drives. Shall Americans
continue on their sorry way, with more than a third of their people in
distress, or shall they enter upon the road to the New Order of the
Ages, in which all citizens shall share abundantly in the production
of a balanced-load economy?
<p>
When we are organized and equipped to supply our own material needs,
then it is soon enough for us to extend our humanitarianism to foreign
lands to help relieve human suffering occasioned by drouths, floods,
and other disasters.
<p>
America is in the race for world leadership. Therefore, America should
show the way. Let us take the lead, not in destruction, but in making
the world a good place in which to live. Let the war banners be furled
and war bombs be hurled no more. Let us seek to live in a peaceful
world, free of strife and turmoil.
<p>
That is the practical `vision' which the New Order of the Ages
presents to us. It is not up to `fate,' but up to us to translate this
vision into reality. The way to do this is through Technocracy, for no
other way has been charted.
