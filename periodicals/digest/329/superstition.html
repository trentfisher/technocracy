Great progress has, and is, occurring in the transferring of money
from one individual, or corporation, to another. First, the direct
exchange of goods with the old barter system, then to the use of
seashells as a medium of exchange, then to the coining of little metal
disks, to the printing of various quantities on paper, and now to
electronic transfers on a world-wide basis. However, in all the
progress in such money exchanges, the old money and value concepts
remain the same as in the days of the barter system, and the same old
problems continue to plague humans.
<p>
Perhaps the greatest change in money concepts has been from the time
when the money changers were run out of the temple, to today's "money
changers" who now hold the mortgages on modern-day temples.
<p>
After all the historic interest in money, and the great buildings that
have been built to contain the "dealers" of money, and the thousands
of bank mergers, and the enormous money-changing in the world's
commerce and stock markets, it would seem that more effort would have
been applied to determine its size, weight and atomic structure. What
is money?
<p>
Answers to these questions have never been successfully established by
scientific analysis. Even its existence anywhere in the physical world
has never been proven. It doesn't grow on trees, so where does it
grow?
<p>
The concept of money is only a mental concept. It exists only in the
"minds" of humans. It is a human belief, and is used and accepted by
no other animal on earth. It is only a superstition, designed by
humans, to control their own operations in the physical world.
People's desire for the accumulation of money has grown out of all
proportion to the far more important aspects of human life in a
physical world.
<p>
For the past 65 years, the U.S. has destroyed farm products, and paid
farmers to produce less; has subsidized the foreign purchase of farm
and manufactured products, to keep local farmers and businesses in
business, and to provide jobs for the nation's labor force in a
technological age -- all because of the monetary concepts of a past
age. Forty-million Americans live in poverty as a result.
<p>
These trends clearly indicate a need for more efficient designs for
the distribution of goods and services in a technological age of
rapidly increasing abilities in the production process, with a
declining need for human labor. We will have no choice but to make the
necessary changes so that the distribution process will be as
efficient as the production process. To do otherwise will only
increase the problems of the debt structure, poverty, crime and war.
<p>
Everyone wants these problems corrected, but few are willing to make
the changes required. To abandon old concepts and learn new ones is
never easy -- and are almost impossible for the chief beneficiaries of
the old system. If 40 million living in poverty, and another 40
million living only a little better, is not incentive enough, then it
is obvious that North Americans are not ready to insist on important
social change.
<p>
However, the time is rapidly approaching when it can't be postponed
any longer.
