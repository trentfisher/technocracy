TECHNOCRACY INC. is a membership research organization which was
incorporated under the State laws of New York in 1933. Prior to that,
there was a group of engineers, scientists, and experts in various
fields who called themselves the Technical Alliance. They operated
from 1918 until 1933. It was as a result of their research that the
present membership organization of Technocracy was formed.
<p>
Based upon their research, Technocracy Inc. made several statements,
at that time, regarding the wellbeing of a social order, or social
system, in North America. Among other things, they stated that
technology would place an increasing burden on the ability of a Price
System to continue to function in North America.
<p>
Now, we, Technocracy Inc., define a "Price System" as: "any social
system that effects its distribution of goods and services by means of
commodity evaluation"; that is,  that employs any debt token or money.
As the Alliance pointed out, as a form of society becomes more
complex, it will be more difficult to exchange goods and services by
means of commodity evaluation, for, not only will it present physical
problems, but it will also become more and more difficult to keep
track of the financial records related to the exchange of goods and
services -- related to the exchange of items between various business
enterprises, and to maintain records necessary to maintain any kind of
business, regardless of it being big or small.
<p>
It will also become increasingly difficult to balance this with the
production of goods and services. We all know we are in the year 1998,
and less than two years from now we will be entering what we call the
new Millenium; in other words, the year 2000 will begin.
<p>
To give you an idea of some of the problems concerning the Price
System, from a monetary point of view, let us examine what is going to
happen shortly in Europe, and, will, at the same time, have a
tremendous effect on the financial affairs here in North America and
other parts of the world.
<p>
In 1999, they are going to come out with an economic unit of currency.
In other words, there will be one common currency common to most of
Europe. At the present time, eleven nations have signed up to take
part in the economic monetary units in 1999 -- a short nine months
from now.
<p>
These countries are: Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany,
Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Holland, Portugal, and Spain. These
countries have committed themselves to taking part in an economic
common currency, next year. The Economic Currency Unit (ECU) means you
are going to have the added cost of exchange rates.
<p>
The things that will have to be up-graded in Europe, prior to 1999,
are tax software. All financial statements will have to be
re-designed; automatic teller machines will have to be revamped so
they will accept two kinds of coins and two types of currency. Historical
data, necessary for the records of any large business, will have to be
converted, and there will have to be a currency conversion. In other
words, they will have to be able to convert currency from national
currency to European currency and back again.
<p>
It means that the value of the European currency will have to be set
against the national currency, so they have until the year 2002 in
order to make this economic monetary union work. It means that the
European monetary union will set the value of the European currency.
They will set the value against various countries which are competing
at this time in the economic union. The transition period will be from
1999 to 2003. During that time, business and government will have to
deal with two sets of currencies -- the European currency and the
local currency. For example, in the case of Germany, they will have to
convert the mark into European round numbers, then convert the
European currency back into the mark, and round it off again. Now,
this is known as "triangulation."
<p>
The only problem with this business of triangulation, is that most
computer systems today are not designed to handle triangulation. And
another problem is, that computers only deal with decimals to two
places. Some currencies, like the Italian lira, which is part of this
common monetary currency, have no decimal system places whatsoever.
Therefore, the Italian system, for all intents and purposes, next
year, becomes obsolete. The European Monetary Union states that all
systems must account for six decimal places -- which will make most
systems in effect at the present time in Europe and North America,
obsolete, -- because, as stated, they can only account for two decimal
places. This entails horrendous costs, not only in man-power, but also
in the necessary calculations which will have to be made.
<p>
From a monetary point of view, it has been estimated that it will cost
$1.10 for a line of code. And there are billions, literally billions,
of lines of codes which have to be converted. This is in Europe,
alone, but it is causing a great deal of concern, not only in Europe,
but also in other parts of the world. Also, the Federal Reserve in the
United States is, likewise, nervous about what will take place between
1999 and 2003. It not only means that the main frame of large
computers has to be converted, but, also, all the small businesses
with their small personal-type computers have to be converted, if
everything is to operate as is planned, and as it is expected.
<p>
Now, the Millenium bug, likewise, as you have already heard, for the
year 2000, many computers will have to be converted to accept the year
2000. This means that all affected software has to be tested. In most
places, most computers will go back to the year 1900, and it has been
estimated that it will take 700,000 person-hours to do the necessary
conversions to make sure that it works as it should. This, of course,
will be detracted from other tasks, and will be immeasurably difficult
to keep the economies of Europe and the United States on as healthy a
basis as they have been for the last few years. All these person-hours
of labour are directed to realigning computer systems, and will not be
used for other tasks. And it means that huge sums of money will be
used up in the conversion, from the system we have now, to what they
expect to have starting next year, and before 2003.
<p>
This is typical of a Price System. These problems are not new. These
problems are 30 or 40 years old. They have been in existence ever
since computers were first introduced on a major scale in North
America and Europe, and all across the world. They have known that
these things had to be done 30 or 40 years ago when they first started
to use computers on a large scale. But, of course, with Price System
expediency, they have left it until now so -- a couple of years will
go by before anything of any significance is being done about it. In
other words, don't put off today what you can put off until tomorrow,
and if tomorrow doesn't come soon enough, you put it off for another
day until the problem becomes, if not unsurmountable, very tough,
indeed.
<p>
It would be cheaper, and far more efficient, if we were to think more
realistically -- realigning our distribution system from a medium of
exchange, based upon money -- to what Technocracy talked about 60-odd
years ago -- a method of distribution based upon the conversion of
energy.
<p>
In today's modern technological society, energy is the prime mover of
everything we do. It is conversion of energy into use-forms that is
keeping us all alive. A conversion of energy into use-forms enables us
to have a relatively high standard of living that we still manage to
enjoy here in North America and many parts of Europe.
<p>
The more complex a society becomes, the more difficult it becomes to
exchange goods and services.
<p>
But, the thing that is keeping us going, and is keeping us alive, and
keeping this system operating, is energy -- the conversion of energy,
into a use-form. And if we were to base our distribution system on the
conversion of energy -- the amount of energy it takes to bring us any
particular commodity, or to provide us with any particular service --
it would be easier to keep track of what is being produced, what was
being consumed, where it was being consumed, how much inventory on
hand at any given time, knowing exactly what was being used, what
there was a demand for, and things that there was no demand for; so
that, if need be, they could be discontinued.
<p>
And this is what appears to be a simple proposition at the present
time. The more complex a society becomes, the more difficult it
becomes to exchange goods and services based upon commodity valuation,
and the more uneven, and the more inoperative, a Price System will
become. That means: it becomes more difficult to place consumer power
in the hands of a sufficient number of people to keep our society
operating. As technology becomes more advanced; as technology becomes
more efficient; as computers are more able to do the tasks that, up to
now, have been done by human beings, the more difficult it will be to
place consumer power into the hands of the general public, and the
more difficult it will be to maintain a vibrant economy.
<p>
Bear in mind that, if we have a productive system which is highly
efficient -- turning out goods almost at will in the numbers that are
required -- it will become increasingly difficult to get sufficient
numbers of people to consume it. And, as more jobs disappear, and as
more people are disemployed, the ability to place consumer-power will
become more difficult. The problems that we face, today, will become
more extreme, and more complicated, and the upheaval that will be
caused to a large number of people will increase.
