<p>
Has the sleeping giant awakened? It is beginning to appear that way.
<p>
The media, that great communication network, loosely connected, but
lovingly associated, has now discovered the horror of environmental
disaster hanging over this earth.
<p>
Heretofore, ecology, insofar as the media and general public was
concerned, involved the study and interest by oddballs and a few
academics. The media touched on their activities dutifully, but
overwhelmed the apathetic public with topics of money, politics,
millionaires and, in recent years, sex. Media techniques leaned to
those human interests to attract readers, listeners, viewers and
advertisers, to maintain income.
<p>
Mention of a redesign of our social system was considered sacrilege.
What might befall future generations, or nature's house, was secondary
to the prime consideration of making a profit. Over hundreds of years,
the pattern of hornswoggling others for self-aggrandisement was, and
still is, accepted by media and public alike, as normal and necessary.
If you obtain a sizeable quantity of money, you are successful, no
matter how you got it.
<p>
<h3>Enemies of conditioning</h3>
<p>
During the past hundred years, there have appeared two sly enemies of
popular human conditioning. These enemies have worked their way into
society by the invitation of Man and now that they are firmly
established, they can never be banished. They are: the twin brothers
-- technology and rapid change.
<p>
<h3>Economic confusion</h3>
<p>
Confusion, created by the twin brothers (monsters), is tearing apart
the fabric of pre-technological economics under which we are now
socially struggling. They have caused individuals, groups, and
governments to rush about applying band-aids to repair holes which
appear with greater frequency each year. And the more holes that rent
our social fabric, the more people argue, and blame each other, for
not applying band-aids in the right place, or in those positions where
millions of different opinions consider they should be applied.
<p>
Due to historic conditioning, it is generally agreed that people
should think only in terms of politics, money and profits. But
technology has upset the old apple cart, and while people scramble to
retrieve the apples, technology marches on to create more social
havoc. And, only now are the money-seekers realizing that the headlong
rush for profits has aided in the potential destruction, not only of
our Continent, but also the entire planet.
<p>
The quandary now is, how can we continue making profits and still
preserve the house in which we all live? Every suggestion or attempt,
so far, has ended in failure.
<p>
Money and technology are incompatible in a technological society.
Technocracy's statements come from the great wellspring of scientific
knowledge and research -- that same science that now provides us with
the technology for our daily needs.
<p>
There are millions of opinions, but only one science.  Science is
based on the known physical laws.
<p>
Technocracy cuts through the social maze of opinions, beliefs,
hunches, fantasies, and dreams, with scientific facts. Technocracy
tells it like it is. Those who choose not to know about social facts
invariably suffer under stress, anxiety, and discomfort, but that is
their prerogative. They can stay in the torture chamber, or search for
a way out. Technocrats choose the latter.
<p>
Before anyone can get a factual picture of the economic and ecological
dilemma facing us today, he or she must observe and understand the
cause.
<p>
In simple terms, there has been more technology invented and
fabricated in the last century, by scientists and technologists, than
in all of the hundreds of centuries recorded by historians.
<p>
The root of most social problems can be traced to the fact that, while
technology has shattered practically all of the ancient methods of
producing physical needs, the distribution of those goods is still
being attempted by the same ancient methods practiced for centuries.
<p>
<p>
It is done by politicians, money-lenders, knaves, and sincere people,
all contriving not to distribute the bountiful necessities and
comforts fashioned by technology, but to manipulate money, in order to
see that large numbers of the population don't get adequate purchasing
power.
<p>
This must be so, because the Money System -- Price System -- is
designed (if you could call it `designed') to distribute only a
scarcity. If everyone had adequate purchasing power in money, the
entire Price System would immediately collapse. Think about all the
trappings which would be unnecessary if everyone had sufficient money
to purchase what they need.
<p>
You will then realize how many useless pursuits are practiced, today,
in our witchcraft society. There is more human energy expended in
devising means whereby citizens are denied purchasing power than human
energy expended in devising means to get that purchasing power out
where it belongs. In the process, we pollute, waste, and desecrate the
Continent.
<p>
Before you brush this off, tally up the information in the media that
reports all of the disputes, arguments and concerns over money -- who
should get it and who should not -- and you have to admit that the
obsession with money has blinded the sanity of North American
citizens.
<p>
With technology pouring out a plethora of goods -- more than can be
sold at a profit -- we find thousands of organizations and parochial
governments hell-bent to get money by preventing others from getting
it, while wasting our resources and poisoning the planet. All this to
create the necessary scarcity for the preservation of the politico-
financial system, known as the Price System.
<p>
Technocrats find this all the more pitiful and absurd, since some of
the same scientists and technologists who contributed to the
technology we now have, foresaw the present economic situation, and
spent many years voluntarily outlining a social concept which can
largely overcome most of the problems we now experience.
<p>
The conceptual blueprint for gracious and abundant living for all
North Americans has been available, and has been offered to
governments, organizations, and individuals, to examine, for more than
sixty years. For the most part, those groups and individuals have
chosen to close their eyes to it, and they continue suffering or
complaining. What a pity we can't scrape up enough money to have it
all printed in Braille!
<p>
Nevertheless, the two sly enemies of socially-blind people are
relentlessly pressuring the millions of apathetic citizens on the
Continent with rapidly increasing vigor, as technology marches
forward, and the citizens firmly seize their ancient social
conditioning and attempt to march backward.
<p>
Technocracy scientists put it all in a nutshell decades ago. They
said: "Technology will become too expensive for money." There is a
hint of this coming, as our North American governments wrestle with
taxation which will barely cover the interest charges on debts
incurred to create the "prosperity" of the past three decades.
<p>
And as the disemployed find themselves unable to cope with technology,
either before or after being booted out of their jobs, they become
victims of stress, anxiety and frustration.
<p>
Since we have the resources, the know-how of competent technicians,
and a design concept available, the present untenable situation is
patently ridiculous.
<p>
Now that the media has discovered the horrific state of our ecology,
how much longer will it take them to discover where the money will
come from to rectify the ongoing destruction? The more technology
installed, the less money available. The fear of more debt may soon
transcend the politicians' dreams.
<p>
If we are to be granted the luxury of hope, let us hope that the
media, and the citizens of this North American Continent, will soon
"discover" the Technocratic concept for a distribution system which is
compatible with technology.
<p>
It is the only concept which, if implemented, can banish drug
trafficking, muggings, poverty, most diseases, and the destruction of
our environment.
<p>
Thinking is not always easy; but it is much more desirable than
destitution, misery, and choking on pollution.
<p>
Think about Technocracy. Read about it, investigate and study it. It
is painless. And it can take the sting out of our social miseries.
