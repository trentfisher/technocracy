<EM>Many people must feel that they are caught in a barbed
wire enclosure -- like the one we have shown on our cover. Whenever
or wherever they move, to try to better their environment, they are
torn by the barbs of poverty, worry, and distress. Many of them blame
themselves for straying into the barbed wire net; many of THEM ARE
blamed for getting themselves entangled in the hooks of unemployment
and debt, finally ending up torn and bleeding, where they may be grudgingly
rescued by the uncompassionate welfare net.</EM>
<p>
This is a simplistic comparison, we know, but there are
many people who are distressed by their own poor circumstances, or
distressed by watching the environment disintegrate, or seeing other
people in poverty, or the escalation of crime -- well, we can go
on and on as to what distresses people. All these symptoms have been
evident to some thinking people for over 60 years, among them, the
Technocrats. We put out warning signs, but these have been ignored.
But, as time went on, during which there were some wars, then a couple
of false prosperity eras, and then -- out of the fog of complacency
-- people suddenly find themselves in the 1930s' time warp --
the same one in which their grandparents had been trapped.
<p>
In the 1930s, when people heard what a Technocracy
would do for them, they joined this Organization in droves. Huge Technocracy
Sections and Units sprang up in every city, town and hamlet. Technocracy
offered a workable technological design to re-organize the social
system. Fourteen years of research by seventeen very well-known
and respected scientists, the likes of Thorstein Veblen, and others:
engineers, educators, architects, bio-chemists, mathematical technologists,
forester-naturalists, had gone into planning a safe, peaceful,
and bountiful environment in which people could be healthy, well-educated,
able to enjoy their lives -- working at jobs they loved, and participating
in whatever sport or hobby or artistic expression they wished. There
would have been no debt, no environmental destruction; and, probably,
no wars. Certainly, no poverty.
<p>
But, before many of these people understood the true
liberation a Technocracy would provide for them, World War II, a saviour
for the industrialists of this Continent, was invented. Munitions
factories beckoned the millions of unemployed. Propaganda lured young
men into the armed forces with the promise of travel, exciting careers,
and cash. Cash they hadn't had for years was the dangled carrot. Death
was never mentioned.
<p>
After the war, there was a brief prosperity, interspersed
from time to time with some downward spirals as machines started making
great inroads into taking over their jobs. The Organization of Technocracy
was unknown to most of them as, by this time, there was a conspiracy
of ``hush hush'' over it. Where it had made big news before,
the media have never mentioned Technocracy again, even to this day.
<p>
But the media have always been a voice for their
rich and powerful owners, and have been dishing out the propaganda
coming out of those political and financial houses of this Continent
-- telling us that democracy is the system under which we are living,
and that we must keep voting for it.
<p>
People who have been thus brain-washed actually
believe all this garbage. There may be a few exceptions, some voices
in the wilderness (like the Technocrats) who can see through these
machinations, calling out warnings to their fellow citizens, but,
by and large, most people trot dutifully, like flocks of sheep, to
put their Xs into the ballot boxes. They seem to be oblivious to the
fact that is exactly what they will get out of that procedure: a big
X.
<p>
We are even being taught that poor people are to
blame for their own poverty; and that it must be they, the working
people, who are responsible for the debt, and who now must tighten
their belts in order to get the debt down?
<p>
Fergus Heywood, the editor of Technocracy's Victoria
Section's <EM>123448-B Newsletter,</EM> explains <EM>DEBT</EM> in
this comprehensive manner:
<p>
``<EM>The Ambiguity of Debt:</EM> Debt, where does
it come from? Debt is a ``serious'' game -- a method of trying
to acquire wealth, usually in terms of money. The practice is played,
or pursued, where people try to build up debt against others faster
than they build up debt against them. If one of us has $1,000 in the
bank, the bank is in debt to us in the amount of $1,000, on which
we can demand, by cheque, etc., any amount up to the $1,000.
<p>
``But, the bank can make loans to other customers
on the depositor's $1,000, to the amount of ten times that of the
original deposit. All this is done on paper accounting for up to $100,000
-- the amount of debt owed to the bank by those borrowers. Therefore,
the $100,000, minus our deposit of $1,000, equals $90,000, created
out of nothing but just bookkeeping. All debt exists and grows in
this manner.
<p>
``So, what are we going to do about the debt?
First of all, working people can stop taking the blame for creating
debt. We suggest that we let it go back to nothing from whence it
came, along with the Price System which supports debt. We are 70 years
late in attending to the problem of debt.''
<p>
Now, what about the other problems facing everyone
on this Continent -- the breakdown of our environment which threatens
our health, our water supplies, our air, our soil?
<p>
<EM>And Technocracy has a special message for environmental
groups who are trying to snip that barbed wire, strand by strand,
only to become more entangled as the wire snaps back around them.
</EM>
<p>
First of all, Technocracy applauds the efforts of
all those brave souls who are on the front lines, fighting against
the short-sighted stupidity of a financial system destroying our
Continent. Your well-intentioned groups and organizations have
sprung up to try to save the environment, save the poor, save the
children, save the animals, save the birds, save the bears, save the
green space, and the water, and the air, et al. However, concerted
efforts by the monoliths of industry, the captains of investment portfolios,
the power of the G-7; have conspired against you. They don't care
what happens to any of us, or the environment.
<p>
Zygmunt Bauman, Emeritus Professor of Sociology at Leeds University
in England, concluded that the wealthy people -- who happen also
to be the politically powerful -- all over the world, will soon
not even need the poor. They will have it all, and the rest of us
can just starve to death for all they care. They do this now, in the
Third World countries, and if you can read the signs, that is the
level to which they are driving most of us. (Mind you, the way these
G-7 people are treating the earth, there may not even be an atmosphere
in which they can live; they may not be as smart as they thought they
were.)
<p>
SO, WHAT TO DO? Remember that old saw: <EM>United
we stand; divided we fall</EM>. Technocrats were `environmentalists'
years ahead of everyone else. The scientists who founded this Organization
foresaw that the <EM>misuse of technology</EM> would cause chaos in
our environment and in our lives. However, they knew that technology
could be used to bring people up from poverty; that by harvesting
our natural resources, it could save the wealth of this Continent
for generations to come. We can still turn things around.
<p>
Back to the article by Fergus Heywood, he further
explains that this is what must be done to save all of us from possible
extinction: ``We can establish a measurable accounting system,
known as `Energy Accounting'.<EM> All energy</EM> comes from the sun,
directly or indirectly. Everything we are, and everything we do, is
somehow related to energy, calories, watts, megawatts, horse power,
solar power, etc. `Extraneous Energy' is energy other than human or
animal muscle, which can, and does, produce an abundance of goods
and services through the use of technology. It is the height of stupidity
to build a machine to do our job, then cry Jobs, Jobs, Jobs, when
this same technology is there to free us from toil and give us the
leisure to enjoy the many things our earth provides.''
<p>
But, we can solve our problems when we realize we have to <EM>Know
the Problem First.</EM> A problem that causes crime, poverty, disease,
and tremendous waste of resources (like the planet's forests) is nothing
more than -- you guessed it -- MONEY. Since we have the resources;
since we have the intelligence to create technology that will use
those resources wisely; then we don't need money for anything. Since
money, or the lack of it, is the problem for millions of people, we
say, let's get rid of the problem. Discard the money.
<p>
Therefore, we must all unite, where, with one voice,
we can demand the only change that is ever going to work. <EM> Discard
the money.
</EM>
