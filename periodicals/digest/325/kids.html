For over 60 years, members of the organization of Technocracy
have been trying to look after your children, but we have been thwarted
at every turn. We have spent time and money since the 1930s trying
to wake up the public so historians will not have to ask: ``Why
was nothing done in time?'' Our concern and work is not so much
for ourselves, but for the generations following after us.
<p>
Many Technocrats who have been members of this organization almost
since its inception, have worried about the fate of children --
that, now, makes three generations. We are still wondering why you
didn't listen to us, because our children and your children are now
facing a desperate situation -- the loss of our environment; the
loss of our society.  Throughout those sixty or so years, along with
other people of their generation, they struggled too, to put food
on the table for their families, to educate their children, have mourned
over the deaths of their children killed in a useless war, have witnessed
the struggles their surviving children have had to endure to be able
to provide for their grandchildren. And now, toward the end of their
lives, they are being tortured again when they see that nothing has
changed: their great-grandchildren are being dragged through the
same poverty that they and their children all went through. Plus the
fact that more useless wars have been fought; more of their young
killed.
<p>
Ethan B. Kapstein, director of studies at the U.S. Council on Foreign
Affairs, in his book,<EM> Workers & the World Economy</EM> wrote that:
``The world may be moving inexorably toward one of those tragic
moments that will lead historians to ask,<EM> Why was nothing done
in time?</EM> And in the book,<EM> Shakedown</EM> by pollster, Angus Reid,
he echoes those words in this statement: ``The tragic moment that
Kapstein refers to, is precisely the one that lies at the center of
my analysis: the problems confronting workers in the global economy.
These issues are part of a world-wide phenomenon that Kapstein
compares to that which occurred in the 1930s: economic dislocation
and the unwillingness of leaders to recognize the profound problems
confronting their citizens. I don't pretend to have all the answers,
but I know this: we must move quickly -- individually and collectively
-- or the historians will ask the same of Canada:<EM>`` Why
was nothing done in time?''</EM>
<p>
Of course, one must recognize that, for the $30 or
$40 that you would have to pay for their books, by reading them, you
won't find the answer to that question, because, neither Kapstein
nor Angus Reid provided any solution. Also, along with the $40 you
would have to fork over for the touted Jeremy Rifkin's book, in his<EM>
The End of Work,</EM> all you will get is another costly stall on the
way to the abundant life that a Technocracy offers you.
<p>
The saddest reflection on the poverty that all these generations have
endured is that <EM> it need never have been endured.</EM> There has
been a solution -- to do away with poverty -- for over sixty
years. The Organization of Technocracy offered a workable technological
design at that time. Fourteen years of research by seventeen very
well-known and respected scientists, the likes of Thorstein Veblen,
and others: engineers, educators, architects, bio-chemists, mathematical
technologists, forester-naturalists, had gone into planning a
safe, peaceful, and bountiful environment in which people could be
healthy, well-educated, and able to enjoy their lives, working
at jobs they loved, and participating in whatever sport or hobby or
artistic expression they wished. There would have been no debt, no
environmental destruction; and probably no wars. Certainly, no poverty.
<p>
Technocrats have always wondered when people would reach their limit
of social tolerance. Over 60 years have passed without any real change
in the social field, except for the worse. Your children deserved
better. Why didn't you listen to us? We Technocrats wanted a better
life for children. What is this generation doing about their care?
We hope they never have to ask this question: Why was nothing done
in time? Because, Time IS running out!
