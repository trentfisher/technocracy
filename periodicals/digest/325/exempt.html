In his article, <EM>Washington Post, January 23, 1997, Business as
Usual</EM>, David B. Ottaway, writes that, four months after President
Clinton signed a law last year barring financial transactions between
American corporations and countries accused for supporting terrorism,
the administration quietly exempted one such country -- Sudan --
where the Occidental Petroleum Corp. of Los Angeles was cleared to
negotiate with Sudan -- despite the 1996 Anti-Terrorism Act
blacklisting U.S. commerce with seven nations for allegedly supporting
terrorists. ``Two years ago, for example, Clinton forbade any U.S.
oil company transactions with Iran.''
<p>
This is business as usual. The <EM>Business as Usual</EM>
article is a typical example of why people view political contributions
as being nothing short of bribes.
<p>
Following this money transfer is fascinating. After
the money goes to politicians/political parties, the money ends up
mainly for 30-second television sound bites. It is well recognized
that if a politician sponsors these sound-bites in excess of his/her
opponent, and the bites are of high, professional quality, that politician
will most probably be elected. It is a well-established fact that
if one communicates a thought to the public often enough, making something
that is far-fetched sound plausible -- even if it is total
garbage -- and, by all means, add some humor -- the public will
accept that pseudo information as being factual, even gospel. There
is never a public election in which some form of this procedure is
not part of the election process. It is a ``given'' in all elections.
It is because this procedure is so important to a politician that
he/she spends a considerable amount of time ``begging'' for
money. Of course, like the case above, the political contributor gets
value received for his/her contribution.
<p>
While the fine points of this procedure may be unique in the U.S.,
the general idea of a ``pay off'' to get a favor, is ancient.
In all past societies, some identical or similar procedure was accepted
as the normal way to conduct political affairs. But all past societies
were primitive and agrarian and they could tolerate this method. We
cannot.
<p>
We have matured into a scientific, technological age. To think our
head of state, our President, must play all types of silly games in
order to get in, and/or stay in office, and that we acquiesce to this,
brings our intelligence into question. With the complexities of our
society -- it is ludicrous for our head of state to be wasting
his/her time in the `garbage' that our political system requires.
<p>
The requirements of our scientific, technological age must be run
in the most efficient manner possible. Anything short of that puts
our survival in jeopardy.
<p>
For many years, Technocracy has maintained that our scientific age
<STRONG>must</STRONG> forego any type of a political structure with a
politician as head of state. To tolerate anything short of a
technically qualified person as head of state invites disaster.
<p>
And, for many years, Technocracy has advised fellow North Americans
that we must discard our social economic structure -- our Price
System. This system worked somewhat adequately in the days when the
oxcart was the vehicle for transportation. We have come a long way.
<p>
Also, for many years, as vehemently as it could, Technocracy has called
North Americans' attention to the fact that this Organization has
a solid replacement for our oxcart Price System; namely, its <EM>Technological
Social Design.</EM> Those who take the time to study Technocracy's concepts
will be exhilarated to know we have at our fingertips the capability
of bringing into existence the greatest society ever known to humankind.
The day of the politician is over; the day of technicians being at
the controls is waiting to begin. We have some interesting literature
available on this subject.
