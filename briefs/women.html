Technocracy offers to the women of North America a goal that is really worth
fighting for. Technocracy offers equal incomes for all -- not merely equal pay
for equal work. There would be equal income as a right of citizenship. The goal
of equal rights under the Price System is just not big enough. The amendment
for equal rights falls far, far short of what this Continent has to
offer through the social design proposed by Technocracy.
</blockquote>
<P>
Let it be stated at the outset that fighting for equality
under the Price System is the epitome of futility -- in
short, it is not worth the effort. The fight for the equal
rights amendment (ERA) is jousting at windm il Is brought
up to date. Proof? Women won the right to vote in
August, 1920; the equal rights movement started shortly
thereafter and has continued to the present time -- six
decades!  The U.S. Congress finally passed the equal
rights amendment in 1972, but ratification by the states
still has not occurred. Opposition to the equal rights
amendment has come not only from men but also from
very articulate and determined women who fear social
change as much as do men. What neither side realizes is
that social change cannot be legislated. It cannot be
stopped. It has already happened. It was in the same six
decades during which women have been battling for
equal rights legislation that the greatest social change in
the history of the world has taken place. Politics hadn't
a thing to do with it -- except perhaps as an impediment.
<P>
<H3>THE WAY IT WAS</H3>
<P>
At the turn of the century, net production of electric
energy was 5,969 million kilowatt-hours. Very few
households were wired for electricity. There were no
gadgets such as washing machines. It was the old washboard and copper
boiler on a wood-burning stove that
were used. Human muscle was the source of power.
There were few vacuum cleaners as we know them today.
Only the affluent had anything resembling power equipment in the homes
-- operated by servants (female).
The majority of women lived in rural areas or small towns
serving the farms. Clothes were homemade on a foot-pedaled sewing
machine or sewn by hand. The more
affluent, of course, had seamstresses come in perhaps
twice a year to do the family sewing. Sewing was one of
the very few occupations open to women at that time.
Marriage was the primary goal of most women. Meals
were cooked on a wood-or coal-burning stove. Every
day and every waking moment of every day was filled
with household chores to do. Monday was washday,
with the water carried in buckets from a well -- and with
the clothes out on the line before breakfast! Tuesday was
ironing day, with the irons heated on the stove (winter
and summer). The clothes were cotton, many heavily
starched. Fridays were cleaning days -- with broom and
scrub brush, on hands and knees, to get the wooden floors
sparkling clean. Saturday was baking day -- home-baked
bread to last the week. In between, there were children
to care for, gardening to be done and even field work
when necessary, if the family lived on a farm. There was
precious little time for contemplating or worrying about
``rights.''  Women, then, were just too busy and too tired
at day's end to do much about it. It was a dawn-to-dusk
workday. There was no time for a career outside the home
except for perhaps teaching for the unmarried. This was
the time when the adage of ``Women's place is in the
home'' held sway, simply because there was no choice.
It was not unusual for women to bear 10, 12 or more
children. The state of hygiene and medical help being
what it was at that time, not all children survived to maturity. Birth
control was something that was only whispered about and not available
to most women. A woman,
generally, was worn out by the age of 35. It was also not
unusual for a man to have had three or four wives in his
lifetime. Voting would not, could not, have helped
women, then, any more than it is helping them now.
<P>
<H3>THE INTRODUCTION OF CHANGE</H3>
<P>
By 1920, the use of electricity increased almost tenfold -- to 56,559
million kilowatt-hours. That was the
year the 20th amendment was ratified, following several
decades of women fighting for the right just to vote. It
was a very dubious victory, in keeping with the history
of political chicanery. The inventor who developed the
small electric motor did more for women's liberation
than all the rhetoric of all the politicians since George
Washington's time. The development of the small electric motor paved
the way for the mass production of
vacuum cleaners, washing machines, beaters, and a myriad
of other gadgets that are taken for granted today. Social
change was on the way with a vengeance.
<P>
At the turn of the century, the family, for the most
part, was a self-contained unit. The man worked outside the home; he
was the sole bread winner; the woman
stayed home taking care of the home and children, completely dependent
upon the husband and father for economic sustenance. She, in turn,
provided him with free 
services of a cook, laundress, seamstress, gardener, housekeeper,
nurse, teacher and mistress. They were mutually
dependent upon each other. It was all hard, unremitting
labor, but more or less independent of outside needs.
<P>
Most everybody was in the same situation. With the development of
cheap electricity, homes were soon wired,
eliminating many tedious chores for women (and for men,
too). Electric stoves began to make their appearance,
eliminating wood-chopping. Expanding industry demanded greater
record-keeping. With the invention of
the typewriter and other technological developments
in the home and in industry, women began to flock to
offices and factories. In 1950, the total production of
electric energy was 388,674 million kilowatt-hours; this
increased to 844,188 million kilowatt-hours by the end
of the decade. The family, as it was known at the turn of
the century, had changed drastically. It no longer was a
self-contained unit. Small towns around the periphery
of large cities became ``bedroom'' communities. That
is, people living in the small towns obtained jobs in the
large cities and commuted back and forth. A home or
apartment became, to a large extent, merely a gathering place for
family members in the evening. Entertainment, work and schooling were
obtained outside the home.
<P>
<H3>SOCIAL CHANGE</H3>
<P>
Social change, brought about by the installation of
energy-saving devices in the home, the farm, the factory,
is in full swing. Today, our use of electricity is astronomical.
Voting had nothing to do with it. Thomas Davenport, of Brandon, Vt.,
patented the first electric motor
in 1837.  Nicola Tesla developed the electric motor to
where it could be used universally. These men were
apolitical. They simply had an idea and they developed
it. The commercial use and exploitation was made by
Price System promoters, not for the liberation of anybody or any
class, but because it was profitable. In the
process, both men and women have been ``liberated''
from the back-breaking toil that obtained from early
history. The irony, here, is that the vested interests that
promote labor-saving gadgets for profit are mostly the
same vested interests that promote the insult of women
being treated as second-class citizens. Their wage scales,
as compared to men's, for the same type or work, attest
to that.
<P>
<H3>EQUALITY</H3>
<P>
Technocracy offers to the women of North America
a goal that is really worth fighting for. Technocracy offers equal
incomes for all -- not merely equal pay for equal
work. There would be equal income regardless of the
work, be it menial or cerebral. The goal of equal rights
under this Price System is just not big enough.	Where
do today's feminists want equality? In business? In
politics? Both these endeavors are legal, lawful, confidence games. A
politician operates from one election
to the other; a businessman operates on the profit
basis -- if it pays, he will support almost anything. The
financial balance sheet is his criterion. The amendment
for equal rights falls far, far short of what this Continent has to
offer through the social design proposed by
Technocracy. After six decades of fighting for equal
rights, women are still discriminated against in the job
market. Sexual harassment is one of the recurring
complaints of women who have succeeded in invading
traditionally male occupations. Fearful of losing their
foothold, after years of schooling and preparation,
women either submit or work in less than ideal conditions. In a
Technocracy, both men and women would
be free to give their attention to the job, without fear of
intimidation. If a person were transferred or demoted,
the move would not affect his or her income; it would
be guaranteed for life.
<P>
Women would also be freed of having to work a ``double shift.'' That is,
after a day at the office or factory,
women now generally still have to do the housework,
cook or whatever; if they have a family, children, it is
doubly hard. No better picture has been drawn of this
situation than the one by Ann Berk (<cite>My Turn</cite>, Newsweek,
September 29, 1980): ``Most working women in
their 30s and 40s are physically exhausted and emotionally drained,
hysteria nibbling around the edges of their
lives. They're the ones who still believed in having babies,
who were taught to please men and sometimes even enjoyed it. And while
they no longer worry about floors
you can eat off, they find it hard to shelve their children's
needs and the desires, however quaint in 1980, of their
men. Those in their 20s who think they have a lock on
sanity, because they've decided against having children
and permanent attachments, may wake up when they're
50, if they haven't succumbed to a heart attack or lung
cancer, to find themselves curiously empty.
<P>
``However women play it, there are hard choices to
be made that all entail loss -- and while that career clock
is ticking away, so is the lifeline to the rest of the territory that
remains steadfastly theirs. For babies still
usually turn to their mothers, women still usually keep
the children after a divorce, do the cooking, the cleaning and laundry
and decorate the house and call the
plumber. There are still ballet lessons and piano and
softball practice, dental appointments and teacher conferences, and no
one has yet found a way to eliminate
adolescence.The beat goes on -- it's merely in double
time now.''  This is the price that our present social
system extracts from one segment of the population.
The march of technology has pushed women out of their
traditional, historic roles, but the Price System has not
``moved over,'' has not made way for the social change
that technological innovations have created.
<P>
<H3>MYTHS OF THE PRICE SYSTEM</H3>
<P>
It must be borne in mind that the Price System is a
system of disadvantage. So long as it exists, so long as
we try to operate under a Price System, someone, or
some group, or race, will be exploited by the small minority that has
succeeded under the rules of the game.
Women have long been on the receiving end of this system
of disavantage. Men have promoted this, to a large extent, because of
a belief that women are a threat to their
jobs. In a Technocracy, this threat will not exist. Many
myths regarding the relationships between men and
women have already been laid to rest by the implacable
march of technology.
<P>
Up until the 17th century it was known by all the most
learned men and the ecclesiastics that men were the dominant factor in
procreation. In some societies it was
thought that men were the sole 'factor and women merely
incubators. Then the microscope was developed! Although it took a
couple more centuries or so of trial and
error, (refining of the lenses to make it more accurate and
workable), in 1854 someone observed the fusion of the
ovum and sperm (this in the sperm and egg of a frog!).
So, there was the irrefutable evidence of the female
being equally responsible and a full partner in the creation
of another life. (In some circles it was even conceded
that the female might, after all, have a soul!). This
startling development (fusion of the sperm and ovum)
shattered ten thousand years of ignorance, superstition
and bigotry regarding women.
<P>
Unfortunately, new myths developed which were just
as denigrating to women: it was felt that women's brains
were too fragile for higher education and that women
were unable to fend for themselves; they must have a man
to take care of them. It was held that women were unfulfilled unless
they were pregnant and caring for children. ``Barefoot and pregnant''
was only one of many
derogatory terms expressing this view. With the world
filling up with people, both men and women are waking
up to the fact that procreation, unchecked, threatens the
very survival of mankind.
<P>
The myth that this is a ``man's world'' and woman
merely an extension of the male, a subordinate being, is
being shattered by the march of technology. Also, the
march of technology is obliterating the line between
``woman's work'' and ``man's work.'' Women are not
inferior, nor are they superior to men; they are different,
but of equal importance. They are both energy-consuming biological
entities. In a Technocracy, no differentiation will be made as to sex,
as far as incomes are concerned. Neither the male nor female will be
penalized for being male or female.
<P>
The really hard work is done by extraneous energy
today. Muscle power is on the way out as far as having
to make a living by it. A restructuring of the entire social mechanism
would eliminate many problems; they
just would not exist. Many jobs for which women now
compete will be eliminated -- advertising, for one. One
of the most powerful mediums in which the myth of
women's inferiority is promulgated is television commercials and
programs. As Kathleen Newland has pointed out (<cite>Sisterhood of
Man,</cite> W.W. Norton & CO.), they
usually depict women as ``economically and psychologically dependent,
deceitful, incompetent, indecisive,
foolish and cruel, or competitive toward other women.''
In another study, women in ads were almost exclusively
portrayed as sex objects or ``moronic housewives obsessed
by cleanliness.'' Huckstering being one of the mainstays
of the Price System, it would be impossible to eliminate
this bias, because it is too profitable. Given the number
of hours devoted to TV viewing by the majority of
people, it is easy to understand the difficulty of changing
the image the world has regarding women. To quote
from a report in the <code>Unesco Courier</code> of July, 1980,
written by Margaret Gallaqher, ``In many ways mass media
systems are a reflection, in microcosm, of distribution of
power and control . . . In the sense that cultural agents of
institutions contribute to the socialization process within
systems which are directed by political and economic imperatives, the
mass media's role is primarily to reinforce
definitions and identities set in a framework constructed
for, and by, men.'' In other words, the status quo will be
maintained as long as it is profitable. Only by elimination
of the entire system of disadvantage can both men and
women develop to their full potential.
<P>
This does not mean that there would be no conflicts
between the sexes. Far from it. Given the orneriness
and cussedness of the human race, there would still be
much for the Social Sequences to do in this field. This
would be a special sequence that would concern itself
with human relations. Although our present judiciary
system presides over conflicts between humans, the litigation is over
property rights, for the most part -- attorneys battling each other in
a ``court of law.'' Under the
Price System, justice is on the side of the most money.
The personnel in a Technocracy would have no such
restrictions. Any conflict between humans would be
dealt with by the most objective and impersonal methods
available. Competing for jobs will not be a point of conflict except
only so far as ability goes. Women and men
will be trained and given every opportunity to develop
whatever skills they have. They will not receive an income for what
they know or do, but because they are
citizens of this Continent.
<P>
<H3>A PROPER GOAL</H3>
<P>
The energies of women, today, can be directed toward the elimination
of a system that uses the most
flagrant, obscene processes of wasteful destruction of
resources to maintain itself. The evidence is before us in
many ways -- and tolerated by men and women alike.
Women have been as short-sighted as men (equally so!)
when it comes to interpreting the events that are unfolding before our
eyes: the disappearing species of birds
and animals of various kinds; the disappearance of our
most valuable prime farmland; the disappearance and ravaging of
forests all over the world -- for the sake of profits; the exploding
populations that make more and more
demands on the world's dwindling resources. Women
have pursued the same short-sighted goals as men -- jobs,
possessions, prestige.
<P>
Paradoxical as it sounds, unless we do institute a system
of scientific governance, a scientific method of production and
distribution on this Continent, and soon,
we shall not even have any descendants to study us the
way we now study our ancient ancestors. We shall have to
institute a system that treats all humans equally, male
and female; black, brown, white or purple; not especially
because of any humanitarian reasons, but because it is
too costly and too wasteful of resources to maintain
this Price System. Technocracy offers a higher standard
of living than has been imagined by even the most affluent, with none
of the pressures or the need to be wary of
someone taking it away that exists today. In a Technocracy, there
would be no ``second class'' citizens because
all incomes would be equal. And the irony is that we had
better do this or else our very survival will be in jeopardy.
We can no longer afford to continue to indulge ourselves
in the wasteful degradation of our resources for frivolous,
throw-away junk. We must institute a system wherein
only the optimum design will be used, whether it be in
cars, homes or household equipment of whatever kind --
designs that will last. It can be done. And, for the first
time in the history of the world, women will be accepted
for what they are: part and parcel of the human race on
an equal basis with men.
