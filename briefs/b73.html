<P>
Man's continued existence depends on science, technology, and
intelligent care of the physical environment, land, sea, and air.
<P>
The most dangerous threats to human existence today are the population
explosion and the deterioration of the physical environment. They are
both interrelated, and both are the results of widespread ignorance and
indifference by man himself. Man's continued existence depends on
science, technology, and intelligent care of the physical environment.
No longer can man live by the primitive methods of his forefathers, nor
can he continue to live by the careless exploitation of the world's
ecology.
<P>
Some progress is being made toward informing the citizens of this
Continent concerning their environment. However, seldom are the many
environmental problems being added up so that they can understand the
total disaster now approaching, or the total requirements for its
correction -- or the total dangers of the failure to do so.
<P>
The world's population is increasing at the rate of 90 million per year,
forests are being destroyed, soil is eroding, and mineral resources are
being exhausted. Hazardous wastes are accumulating with no safe
disposal arranged for. Land, sea and air are being polluted to dangerous
levels, the ozone layer is being depleted and the greenhouse effect
accelerated.  Under these conditions, man is not a permanent resident of
this earth. He is a temporary species.  For he is taking more from the
environment than is being replaced.
<P>
It is a sad commentary on the intelligence of the human species that it
is not able to plan adequately for its own survival. Now that civilized
man has become dominant in the organic world, it seems paradoxical that
he should be headed pell-mell for oblivion.
<P>
To a student of trends, the future of the human species on this earth
appears dismal. Worst of all is the apathy and flagrant denial of these
trends by our so-called leaders who are clamoring for a more rapid
acceleration of the very trends which cause the problems. All the
promises made by politicians are only useless drivel. Only adequate
planning followed by competent action can provide effective solutions.
<P>
In order to continue at a high level of civilization for an extended
period of time, North Americans must accept the changes required:
<UL>
<LI>They must establish a balanced utilization of energy.
<LI>They must return to the soil the fertility which is taken from it.
<LI>They must conserve the Continent's fresh water and mineral resources.
<LI>They must institute a program of population control.
<LI>They must discontinue the depletion of the ozone layer.
<LI>They must slow down the build-up of gases which cause acid rain
and the greenhouse effect.
<LI>And, most difficult of all, they must eliminate the monetary
motivation which prohibits the above requirements from being accomplished.
</UL>
<P>
These things need doing under any circumstances, and they certainly must
be done if the human species is to continue living on this planet. To do
this, man must adopt a new strategy for his social operations and change
his mode of living to conform to that strategy. He must return unto the
ecological system as much as he takes from it. If man can do this, he
can survive and flourish for thousands of  years more on earth. If he
does not do it, nature will take a ruthless course so far as the human
species is concerned.
<P>
It is obvious that these problems will not solve themselves. They can be
solved only by an intentional and coordinated effort on the part
of North American citizens. We must be the ones who execute the tactics
which support the strategy of survival.
<P>
Many of the world's environmental problems are global in scope. The
winds blow pollution across national boundaries, and the
Chernobyl disaster demonstrated the international dangers of nuclear
radiation. Furthermore, as industrial nations continue to delete their
own natural resources, they become increasingly dependent on imports
from other countries. Solutions to such global problems must be on a
world-wide basis. However, the solutions have to start somewhere. Some
nation or continent must lead the way. North America has the best
qualifications for this leadership if its people can overcome their own
politico/economic interference. But only after this continent has solved
its own problems can it be effective in providing leadership for other
nations.
<P>
How can a government which is trillions in debt provide the trillions
required to assist other countries? How can it repair its own
infrastructure, finance environmental clean-ups, bail out its Savings
and Loans, wipe out its own poverty and hopelessness, and eliminate the
drug problem without a collapse of its economic structure?
<P>
How can a nation which can't solve the problem of poverty in the midst
of plenty in its own country provide solutions for the world's problems?
North America's economic system of scarcity values must be totally
redesigned from top to bottom. This Price System ``just grew'' long before
the technological age and long before there were major environmental
problems. The order of magnitude of highly technical operations required
is far beyond the economic abilities of a Price System.
<P>
More than a half century ago, Technocracy Inc. first stated that a time
would come when the Price System would become inoperable. This means
that the country's increasing problems would become so severe that
they couldn't be solved by Price System methods. As a result of its
study, Technocracy has designed the only ``Technological Social Design''
in existence. It is the only method available which can replace the
Price System. This new design is offered to the North American people as
a gift. May we soon demonstrate the intelligence to accept it. The time
for decision has arrived.
