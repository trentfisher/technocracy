<p>
Too often people investigating Technocracy for the first time assume
that they are being confronted with a social idea that they may choose
to accept or reject on the basis of how well it pleases them -- as
though they were being asked to switch from one brand of merchandise
to another brand purportedly a little better than the one they already
use.  They feel that they have a choice of the kind of social system
they shall live in; they then tend to evaluate Technocracy on how
well it appeals to their subjective desires.
<p>
As in the case of most assumptions, this one is in error.  Technocracy
is not being ``sold'' in competition with other alternatives.  When
people attempt to sell an idea, it implies that they seek to benefit
from that sale, that there is something in for them.  A second erroneous
assumption is that Technocrats are promulgating their program in the
hope that they will someday take over the society and rule it according
to their Technocratic blueprint.  These assumptions evidently arise
from a long exposure to the vagaries of politics.
<p>
Technocracy is presented on the basis that it is a carefully engineered
design for operating the social system of North America, either when
the prevailing programs prove unable to function or when enough social
enlightenment develops among the citizens to install it.  Technocrats
do not seek to take over or to operate the technological design they
specify for this Continent.  They have an abhorrence of the profligate
waste and extreme corruption that are characteristic features of Price
System operations.  But, as every Technocrat knows, what really counts
is the strategic analysis and the social design that will give citizens
of North America the means to achieve survival.
<p>
Technocracy has analyzed the physical changes occurring on this Continent
and has plotted their future course, not from the standpoint of personal
desires, but in accordance with the direction in which events are
headed.  Technocrats are fully aware that irreversible changes are
taking place.  They know that the future of North American society
is not being decided by the whims, desires, and hopes of individuals,
but by the force of events.  They know that the Old Order of scarcity,
toil and insecurity is coming to an end.  They know that the next
stage will be either chaos, with wide-spread man-made destruction,
out of which will emerge a low order of political control  (if, indeed
any human life survives) or a New Order based on an intelligent stewardship
of physical things and a vastly more efficient operation of our technological
society.
<p>
The developing trends are not a matter which individuals can decide
for themselves, or prevent.  And, in any event, North Americans cannot
escape the consequences of the developing trends.  The only practical
and sensible decision of the individual is that of adapting to change,
not fighting it or ignoring it.  Technocracy is not creating change
or even the course of change; rather, it is preparing for the next
most probable state of society on the North American Continent.  That
state of society is being ``dictated'' by the rate at which energy is
being converted and by the machines that it powers.
<p>
Science and technology are, by nature, progressive (as contrasted
to politics, economics and theology which, by nature, are stagnant).  Science
and technology cannot be suppressed without endangering the survival
of the human species.  But, there are certain reactionaries who despise
progress so much that they would rather see humanity destroyed than
see social change.
<p>
Within the scarcity conditions of the Price System, there may be a
choice between communism and fascism, between liberalism and conservatism;
but, in an area of high-energy technological production there is only
one ``choice'' -- Functional Control.  Technology cannot be operated
by opinion or desire, only by know-how and skill.  But, by contrast,
your act of voting in any kind of political system; will assure you
of one thing; you will be having an incompetent managing the affairs
of your country -- a politician!
<p>
Goods and services, when they are sufficient to provide an adequate
standard of living for all, cannot be dispensed by means of exchange
values.  A system of measurement of consumption is essential to an
efficient operation of an economy -- to prevent overproduction and
waste.
<p>
When the work of an area is done by wholly automatic machines (or
by those requiring a minimum of human attention), the idea of one's
earning a living through a job of work becomes ridiculous.  When all
citizens are guaranteed equal access to all the goods and services
they can consume by right of citizenship, there can be no masters
and servants.  A whole new social concept is required to fit the conditions
that are developing on this Continent.
<p>
<EM>NORTH AMERICA IS TOO COMPLICATED TO BE RUN BY POLITICS!</EM>
<p>
We still have no coordinated Continent-wide transportation system.
We still have no large-scale plan for collecting the produce of farms,
mines, forests and fisheries. We still have no equitable, coordinated
system for distributing North America's great material abundance.
Air, water and soil pollution are still threatening our very existence.
Housing still is haphazard, inefficient, high cost.
<p>
The pressure of population and the depletion of strategic natural
resources make essential efficient, total planning.  North America
needs objective, efficient scientific adminstration in order to pass
on to every citizen the full benefits of our productive capacity.
<p>
So, the problem facing the individual citizen of North America is
not one of choosing among various political parties for the future.  There
is no CHOICE about how the society must be operated, but Technocracy's
design does offer a CHANCE for North Amercian citizens to have the
best quality of life that an energy and resource efficient technological
society can provide.
