<h1>Price System Bind Continues</h1>
<h2>Information Brief No. 74</h2>

<p>
Today, particularly in the United States, there is serious concern 
regarding the availability and quantity of resources for the 
continuance of the present economic system, a system which, by its 
own rules of operation, is wasteful of energy and mineral 
resources.
<p>
On July 4th weekend in 1976, the year-long celebration of the 
200th birthday of the United States was climaxed by a great 
profusion of entertainment and exhibitions broadcast from New York 
City and Washington, D.C.  All the emphasis was on the moral 
values of a way of life that is dead and gone; but reality is that 
the ideals of the founding fathers were based on hand toil in an 
age of scarcity.
<p>
In striking contrast, the staging and publicizing of these 
celebrations were conducted by the use of the most modern and 
sophisticated 20th century technology; for example, the TV 
broadcast was bounced off Telstar.  Persons attended the doings by 
high-speed air travel, including the SST; and the crowds could 
only be moved and kept orderly by modern electronic traffic 
control equipment.  Technocracy does not object to celebrating, 
but insists that a meaningful emphasis should have been placed on 
the fantastic growth in the rate of energy conversion that has 
occurred on this Continent in that short length of time.  This 
unprecedented development of technology is worthy of 
commemoration.
<p>
Transportation by land, sea and air has developed from its early 
beginnings to high speed travel, to even travel through space.  
Speed of communications includes TV and Telstar.  In prime movers, 
research has already been done on the more efficient use of atomic 
power, that is by fusion.
<p>
The 200 years from 1776 to 1976 has seen more development and 
utilization of technology in North America than in any other area 
of the globe, and more than in any other period in history.  As 
Technocracy points out, social change occurs when there is an 
increase in the use of power.
<p>
Here, in North America, we have progressed from the age of hand-
tools, of toil and scarcity, with a conversion rate of 
approximately 5000 kilogram-calories per capita per day, to the 
present rate of more than 200,000 kilogram-calories per capita per 
day.  This is a 40 to 1 increase in the use of power.  Concurrent 
with this increased use of energy has been the ever-increasing use of
mineral resources. The high standard of living enjoyed by citizens of
Canada and the United States was made possible by abundant and readily
accessible energy and mineral resources with relatively no restraints
on exploitation by the free-booting, free-enterprisers of the Price
System.
<p>
Today, particularly in the United States, there is serious concern
regarding the availability and quantity of resources for the
continuance of the present economic system, a system which, by its
own rules of operation, is wasteful of energy and mineral 
resources.
<p>
A sampling of the 91 minerals on which our high energy 
civilization depends includes: oil, natural gas, uranium, iron 
ore, aluminum, copper, nickel, chromium, manganese, helium, 
antimony, tungsten, tin, columbium, mercury, zinc, lead and 
cobalt. In the use of these essential minerals careful planning 
and non-wasteful procedures are a must for our continued high 
standard of living.  It must be noted in passing that none of the 
politicians in the United States are talking about the critical 
position that the U.S. is in with respect to its essential mineral 
requirements.
<p>
Since its inception, Technocracy has indicated that the increased 
use of high-energy technology would produce an impact of abundance 
which would destroy the Price System operation.  While this 
concept is still correct, the citizens of Canada and the U.S. in 
the near future may be faced with a more imminent economic chaos 
due to the system's inability to cope with a new set of conditions 
with respect to resources.  Faced with critical shortages of 
energy and minerals, a system based on exponential expansion 
cannot continue.
<p>
The Price System in North America is an economic system that must 
expand at a compound interest rate (exponential growth) wherein 
each increase must exceed the previous increase.  With a finite 
resource situation whose reserves are diminishing, our future is 
very critical.  A scientific redesign of our social mechanism is 
imperative for the proper use of these essential minerals, and the 
only organization in North America offering that today is 
Technocracy Inc.
<p>
The bicentennial year of 1976 indicated a 50 percent waste in our 
use of oil and gas, and in the intervening years since then, 
nothing has indicated any change in the wasteful practices of the 
Price System.  Our scientific know-how could implement an 
immediate saving by the installation of a different system of 
operation.  An entirely new transportation system (air, land and 
water) designed to handle the mass movement of people and 
materials would operate at a fraction of today's energy cost.
<p>
The statistical data used above was essentially from the United States 
Geographical Survey report as they apply to the U.S.  The area of 
the Technate, the North American Continent, is in somewhat better 
shape.  Nevertheless, if these shortages cause dislocation in the 
U.S., they will also do the same for the rest of the nations of 
this Continent and also have world-wide repercussions.
<p>
While the technological advances of the past 200 years have 
brought tremendous changes, those changes will be nothing compared 
to the changes that will occur in the next 200 years.  If the 
citizens of this Continent move in the correct direction, their 
standard of living will continue to advance and improve.  If an 
incorrect move is made, we may well sink into oblivion like the 
dinosaurs of old.
<p>
Technocrats, in their self-chosen task as promoters of this new 
idea of the ages, have their work cut out for them.  Technocrats 
urge the active participation of their fellow citizens in this 
quest for collective survival.
