At this time in our history, the human species is finding
it ever more difficult to maintain some degree of synchronization
between the two worlds in which we try to live -- the world of
physical reality and the world of economic rationalization.  On the
one hand, humankind lives in, and is dependent on, life support systems
in their real physical world, while, on the other hand, insisting
on controlling a lifestyle and physical operations within the limitations
and restrictions of a man-made world of economic superstition.
<p>
In that real world of matter and energy, a world which is governed
by natural law, people have lived for millions of years.  They have
discovered methods to grow their food more efficiently and to produce
the products they need, first by hand, then, far more efficiently
with technology.  This is a dependable world in which the sun rises
each morning and the earth makes one trip around the sun each year.  It's
a world in which technology is designed to operate in accordance with
natural law, and be operated according to its design.  This method
worked so well that, by the year 1920, the United States had the ability
to produce enough to supply every North American citizen with everything
they needed.
<p>
Since 1920, the U.S. population has increased from 106 million to
263 million, or by 2.5 times.  At the same time, the energy to power
the technology has increased from 453 million horsepower to 34 billion,
an increase of 74.8 times.  If there is any excuse for 38 million
Americans, including one-fifth of all children, to be living in poverty
today it can only be the result of human stupidity.  It certainly
is not the fault of our technology or the real world in which we live.
<p>
<EM>THEN WHERE IS THE FAULT?</EM>
<p>
Where could it be except in this mythical economic world that people
have inflicted upon themselves?  This economic world was started by
humans themselves when they devised the "Barter System" several thousands
of years ago.  Since then, this Barter System has "grown" haphazardly
into the present highly complex, unwieldly, economic dictatorship.  It
is a system of trade, or commerce, based on commodity values which
are determined by their relative scarcity and desirability.  And to
expedite the trade, debt tokens, or money, have been devised.  It's
an economic system "designed" in the distant past which rewards the
greedy and is instrumental in the destruction of the physical environment.  It's
an economic system based on beliefs, opinions and superstitions, that
cannot, by any possible combination of its parts, be made efficient
enough to match the ability of the technological mechanism to produce.  It's
an economic system that cannot supply North Americans with enough
to keep millions of them out of poverty, and certainly cannot afford
to clean up the environmental mess it has made.
<p>
We citizens of North America do not distribute goods and services
according to our technological ability to produce.  Instead, distribution
is determined by the ability to supply wages as a reward for human
labor.  This method has become so inefficient that wages must be supplemented
by unemployment insurance, welfare payments, subsidies to farmers
and small business, and even to college students.  Here is the reason
we are so deep in debt -- with increasing deficits that if slowed
much will result in an economic depression.  Our only choice is to
increase the debt at an ever-faster pace as technology becomes more
efficient, and then go bankrupt when we can no longer pay the interest
on the debt; or -- reduce the deficits and suffer a depression
some 30 percent worse than that of the 1930s.
<p>
The only reasonable choice is the installation of an entirely new
economic system, designed for this modern world of technology with
its declining need for human labor.  Many attempts to provide solutions
may be expected, and no doubt they will range from the ridiculous,
to the fantastic, to the almost-reasonable.  Attempts will be made
to "rearrange" this Price System in an effort to change as little
as possible, and to allow the top dogs to remain on top.  Which means
that: time and effort will be wasted in such futile attempts --
time that we can ill afford to lose when even a few hours may be critical.
<p>
All the problems now existing -- underemployment, crime, politics,
poverty, debt, bankruptcies, environmental degradation, etcetera,
etcetera, -- are all financial problems, and all together add up
to such a large overall problem that the changes required for a solution
will result in the greatest social change in human history.  And this
change must be made in the shortest length of time of any major change
in the past.  Any attempt to solve such a major problem a little at
a time, and in small pieces, or without allowing major changes, will
be an exercise in futility, and a dangerous waste of time.
<p>
Unfortunately, politicians are powerless to do anything of importance
for the country without enough pressure from the public to overcome
the influence of the lobbyists and their corporate backers who pay
the expenses of political campaigns.  As a result, politicians are
in no position to <EM><STRONG>lead</STRONG></EM>  the country; they
can only react to the pressures presented by the most effective force.
<p>
And, also, unfortunately, public apathy is such that people have allowed
themselves to be cheated out of the plenty their technology has been
able to provide for the past 60 years.  Therefore, nothing short of
a financial debacle -- that compares with the depression of the
1930s -- is likely to force public interest, or financial interest,
into making the changes required.
<p>
Already, the present economic instability is creating more interest
in Technocracy.  More articles are in the press, and more discussions
in schools are in progress.  We can only try to create enough interest,
soon enough, to avoid a completely chaotic state to occur,<STRONG>
so  that  civilization  can  be  continued.</STRONG>
