<P>
The North American scientists are neither noblemen nor freemen in their
society. Unless they are able to achieve some outstanding recognition,
they must remain second-class professionals. The role of the scientist
lacks social prestige, for the majority merely become servants of
businessmen and politicians.
<P>
It is high time that the general public gave more consideration to the
question of how much influence scientists should have in the
determination of social policy and action. In this connection the term
``scientist'' includes technologist and engineer. Scientists, as a group,
have proved themselves to be the most trustworthy and humanitarian of
any group in society, as well as the most competent. They rate a role in
determining the affairs of society far above any yet accorded them -- a
role far more significant than that of mere advisers to non-scientific
decision makers.
<P>
The big advances in social operations will come from people who are
trained in the techniques of science and technology when these people
are no longer influenced or hindered by politician, moralist or
businessman. Scientists are responsible for the discovery and
development of many things in the world which have a profound bearing,
actual or potential, on social affairs.
<P>
Science and technology have provided the means, and politics and
business have made the decisions which gravely threaten the future
survival of the entire population. It is frightening when we realize
with whom among our countrymen social decisions rest.
<P>
It is none too soon for the scientists of North America to be made
responsible for the making of national policy and social decisions.
<P>
<H3>Step In Right Direction</H3>
<P>
A report issued by a committee of the American Association for the
Advancement of Science, on the question: ``How far shall scientist go in
actively participating in the determination of social policy?'' was
published in SCIENCE magazine. In the opening paragraph we find: ``The
committee found that even a cursory examination of this question leads
to a serious conclusion: that there is an impending crisis in the
relationships between science and American society. This crisis is being
generated by a basic disparity. At a time when decisive economic,
political and social processes have become profoundly dependent on
science, the discipline (science) has failed to attain its appropriate
place in the management of public affairs.
<P>
The committee report deplores the fact that there is very little public
interest in science and that it receives an unduly small amount of space
in the press and on television, radio and screen. There is little
inducement for young persons to enter science. Many of the
scientifically trained people in America are being bid for by competing
interests and thereby are being taken away from a
self-interested pursuit in pure science.
<P>
The report shows the difference between the growth of the physical and
that of the biological and social sciences. As a consequence,
developments in chemistry and physics, including nuclear energy, are
pushed forward without adequate attention being given to their
biological and social implications. Progress in basic science is lagging
far behind the practical applications of science; much of the latter
must rely on basic research done 20 or 30 years ago. What we need now is
much more creative research directed toward the discovery of new
knowledge about nature.
<P>
It goes on to discuss the successes of science which are self-evident,
as is readily noted in the fields of industry, health, communications,
and warfare. In some instances the successes of science have gone awry
and threaten serious trouble; for example, radiation dangers from
nuclear explosions; inadequately tested food additives; hazardous fumes,
smogs and dust disseminated by industrial plants, automotive vehicles
and other combustion processes; the rapid depletion of our natural
resources; and the potentiality of a totally destructive war. These
dangers arise mainly from the fact that social decisions in these fields
are ``rarely in the hands of scientists.'' The report concludes with a
recommendation that scientists and scientific bodies should be more
outspoken with their views.  It notes that business, labor, and other
social groups are not backward in making their views and recommendations
known. Science, in comparison with these others, gets very little
publicity, and what little it does get is not always positive. The
report ends on a rather weak note, recommending only that social
agencies and the public be made better acquainted with the work, the
evaluations, and the recommendations of science -- that they might be
able to make better decisions.
<P>
The road ahead is long and rough. Against science are arrayed all the
traditional forces of the Price System.  They can be heard over
the radio and television and read about in the press and on billboards.
These purveyors of non-science speak out of both sides of their mouths
with reference to science. One side praises science for producing
something they can use in their business, while the other side denounces
science as being materialistic.
<P>
Dangerous uses of scientific knowledge are being promoted by agencies
outside of the field of science. Scientists are inclined to be opposed
to war, to human repression, to neglect of social advances, and to
unequal treatment of humanity. But none of these scourges are
alien to the practices of politics, business and moralism.
<P>
The physical equipment of North America is already being operated by the
technical people of the area, and they are doing their job very well
considering the handicaps and deadweight imposed upon them by the
overburden of business, politics and superstition. Think how much
easier and simpler it would be for the technical people if this
overburden was removed and they had full responsibility. A functional
government of a technological society would not be like any of the many
varieties of government that have flimflammed the citizenries of the
world for so many centuries. Let there be a governance of function, not
an authoritarian regulation imposed upon the people by the institutions
of non-science.
<P>
Technocracy invites the technical men and women of North America to
become forthright and aggressive in their insistence that a governance
of function, administered by people of technical training and
achievement, be instituted to replace the predatory gangsterism now
imposed upon our society under the name of ``government of the people, by
the people, and for the people.'' There is no question about the
scientists of America being able to organize a governance of function.
<P>
What is needed now is a modest amount of favorable publicity for
science. This job could be accomplished by the scientists and
technologists of North America courageously acting together through the
associations which they have already established. Timidity, hesitance
and subservience are not becoming to scientists.
<P>
If the organizations of science and technology do not provide adequate
vehicles for social expression, the scientists of North America are
always welcome to join and make their collective views known through
Technocracy Inc. Technocracy is nobody's pawn or servant and it makes no
compromise with the Price System. In Technocracy, one does not have to
be nice to the status quo nor play footsie with the authoritarians.
