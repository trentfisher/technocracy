<H3>Man must soon learn to govern himself intelligently, or he will
not survive!</H3>
<P>
The great irony of our age is that we have, for the first time, the
energy, technological equipment and resources to eliminate starvation,
poverty and inequity.  Yet, conflict among North Americans for the
material goods of our <DFN>affluent society</DFN> has never been more
intense.  The reason for this contradiction is that, while we have the
technological means to produce (without waste) more than enough for
everyone, the archaic political and economic system of this continent
will function only in a condition of scarcity and will not permit the
continent's technology to produce and distribute the requirements for
a high quality of life for all citizens.  If the technology were
managed directly for the benefit of the people, consumer products
would lose their <DFN>value</DFN>, and it would therefore be
impossible to tell them.  Attempting to preserve the  concept of
<DFN>value</DFN>, our present political and economic system (more
correctly called the <DFN>Price System</DFN>) becomes embroiled in all
sorts of insane activities to preserve scarcity and thus
<DFN>value</DFN>.
<P>
As a case in point, let us consider one material without which no life
could continue on the globe -- air.  Air has never been subjected to
the operations of trading financing, mortgaging, loaning, borrowing,
evaluating, or any of the other manipulations of the Price System.
Why?  Because its bountiful supply has never permitted the creation of
a scarcity.  With air, there has never existed the opportunity of
introducing the concepts of <DFN>value</DFN> and <DFN>human
labor</DFN>, which for the basis for both <DFN>free enterprise</DFN>
and socialistic economic theory.  The situation with respect to air
could be duplicated with any other essential product if we satisfy the
requirement that it be adequately supplied.
<P>
In order to survive, the Price System must solve its problem of
maintaining scarcity by cunning public relations techniques,
destroying and stockpiling food to keep prices up, and somehow
sabotaging with legal tangles the productivity of our equipment, so
that a <DFN>healthy</DFN> Price System can be maintained.  Two other
great catch-alls for the disposal of North America's bounty are the
foreign aid program and war.  Even these enormous undertakings are
failing to absorb the production of North American power and machines.
Why do people go hungry in a land that can furnish an adequate supply
for all?  Because they have been conditioned to follow the rules of
the system, no matter how far out of the context of reality those
rules become.  North Americans, to date, have preferred to follow
obsolete rules rather than use their heads in installing a logical
system of governance.
<H3>Problems Are Multiplying</H3>
 <P>
Serious mass problems, incompatible with our technological age, are
crime, poverty, transportation congestion, poor housing, pollution,
unemployment and growing minority group frictions.  And, obviously,
these problems are interrelated.  For example the groups at the bottom
of the occupational and economic pile are feeling the severe effects
of automation first.  The number of jobs for the unskilled and semi
skilled will continue to decrease, and the only hope for the growing
number in the labor force whose services are no longer needed is the
Guaranteed Annual Income or <DFN>make work</DFN> jobs, WPA style.  If
the Guaranteed Annual Income is adopted, the anti-automation pressure
which labor has been exerting on industry, would probably be greatly
reduced, and industry would the proceed with open throttle towards
total automation.  This will, in turn, cause the phasing out of ever
more massive numbers of blue and white-collar jobs and will eliminate
substantial numbers of jobs, even on the executive levels.  Today this
is validated by the use of micro-processing and robots.
 <P>
The present system of <DFN>political  government</DFN> is, in reality,
so fractionated and preoccupied with individual political power
struggles that it cannot mobilize itself to deal  quickly and
effectively with any problem of national scope.  We have an immense,
uncoordinated tangle of roughly 100,000 governments in the United
States from the local and regional levels to the federal level,
including school districts, etc.
 <P>
This, then, is the irrational state of affairs in which we find
ourselves in this Great Technological Revolution.  And the
consequences of irrational management are far more serious for man
than one might suppose.  Man must soon learn to govern himself
intelligently, or he will not survive!
 <P>
Politics, business and religion, which people historically have looked
to for the remedies for social and economic ills are becoming
progressively more impotent in dealing with the new and mounting
pressures generated by automation, population expansion and the
complexity of modern technological existence.  There is no precedent
in history for these developing trends and the direction is
constantly towards greater, rather than lesser, complexity and more
and more massive problems.  Within a business-political structure, or
Price System, the problems cannot be solved because the solutions are
incompatible with profiteering, political power struggles and outdated
governmental concepts.
 <P>
Man has designed and constructed enormous dams, power plants, and
canals, but he has never designed and constructed a total plan for
continental hydrology.  he has designed streamlined trains, and
magnificent railroad terminals, but never an integrated, continental
system of low-cost rail  transportation.  He has designed automobiles
and highways, but never a super-highway system with control of traffic
origination and load factor.  Man has build haphazard economies and
political empires, but never, until the advent of Technocracy, Inc.,
has he designed a self-contained, technologically controlled, social
mechanism.
 <P>
In other words the design of the past has been but the design of the
minutiae and working up from the part to the whole and not the design
of the whole.  With unmeasurable factors, effective social planning
is impossible.
 <P>
The <DFN>free enterprise</DFN> system is man-made.  Although it has
become endowed with a special, almost spiritual status, it is merely
one of the many possible systems created by man to regulate the
exchange of goods and services.  A far more efficient and productive
system would be one in which the operational concepts ere  consistent
with scientific and technological
<DFN>know-how</DFN>.
 <P>
A key concept in operating a Technocracy, as opposed to governing a
political system, is Functional Control.  Function Control is not
control by a group of technological elite.  It is <DFN>control by
technique</DFN> which means that the process which works best is
adopted, and the process which is shown through performance to be less
efficient is discarded.  A functional organization has no political
precedents.  It is neither democratic, autocratic, communistic, or
fascistic.  Functional Control is determined only by the requirements
of the job that must be done, and not by any outside consideration or
influence.  Instead of the location, design and materials of a housing
complex or a dam being determined by political factors, they would be
constructed and located so as to be of maximum effectiveness in meeting
the needs for which they were intended.
 <P>
Technocracy proposes that the administration of the North American
Continent be converted from a disorganized, haphazard political
superstructure, all but alienated from the needs and challenges
brought about by modern technology, into a highly planned,
coordinated system of production and distribution, under the direction
of science.  The resulting Technocracy would exist for the purpose of
harnessing technology to the task of creating an equitable
high-quality life for its citizens.  The North American Continent is a
naturally circumscribed area, and it has the necessary resources,
technology and technically-trained man power.
<H3>Scientific Administration Would Free Man From Toil And Debt</H3>
 <P>
Built into the technocratic design are solutions to the heretofore
perplexing social problems of war as an instrument of economics,
crime, congestion in transportation, poverty, unemployment,
destruction of natural resources, racial friction, poor housing and
waste.  Far from standardizing man and rendering him impotent -- both
of which are being done at a frightening rate under the present system
-- scientific control of technological operations would essentially
free man from toil and debt and enable him to make the most of
himself, with no limit placed upon his aspirations except the limits
of his own ability.
