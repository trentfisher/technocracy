<!--AUTHOR--><h3></h3> 
<!--DATE--><h4>1992</h4>
<hr>
<P>
<h3>By mid-1993 -- world's population reached 5.506 billion people.</h3>
<P>
Just how much is a billion? In order to better understand such enormous
figures, consider a small unit of time, the second. It requires 3,600
seconds to equal one hour. It requires 31.7 years to equal one billion
seconds. The same number of seconds as the present number of people on
earth would equal more than 170 years. This is certainly a great number
of people who must be fed, clothed and housed by the use of the earth's
physical resources.
<P>
It required quite some time for the human population to reach such
astronomical numbers; however the rate of increase is even more
unbelievable After some 7,000 years of recorded history plus an unknown
number of centuries before that, a total of perhaps a million or so
years, the population had reached 1 billion people. This was about 1800
A.D. It then took only 130 years, until 1930, for the 2nd billion to be
added. The 3rd billion required only 30 years, and the 4th only 15
years. By 1989 the population was increasing at a rate which added a
billion people in slightly more than 10 years. The time required to add
a billion people has dropped from over a million years for the first
billion to 10 years for the 5th billion. On a chart this growth curve
would go through the roof of a skyscraper.  97 million people are now
being added to the earth's human population each year. This is enough to
replace the entire population of Mexico in less than a year and that of
the U.S. in 2 1/2 years.
<P>
<h3>This Rate Of Growth Of The Human Population--Is Not Going To Continue.</h3>
<P>
It would be the height of foolishness, and dangerous, to assume that
this is a permanent rate of growth. The earth simply hasn't the physical
resources to support such overwhelming numbers.
<P>
Those who are concerned with the natural world, the real world in which
all plant and animal life must live, must also be concerned with the
earth s ability to support human life in such increasing numbers. The
people who know the most about ecology are concerned about the survival
of the human species. But, on the other hand it is those who know the
least, those who are chiefly concerned with politics and financial or
philosophic concepts, that are foolish enough to ignore physical trends
and to assume that this rate of increase in population can be
maintained. This is not an increase like the nation's debt structure,
which can be increased by adding zeros on paper. This is an increase in
numbers of real, live, human beings whose first requirement, the most
basic for human life, are the physical factors that make life
possible--for example, food that is grown in the arable soil provided by
no other source than nature.
<P>
Those who consider the economic system more important than people should
try to understand that the economic system was designed quite
haphazardly by man In the distant past. It was not imposed on us by
nature, WE HAVE INFLICTED THIS DEVICE UPON OURSELVES. And it certainly
should't be perpetuated at the expense of millions, or billions, of
human lives. When one considers population growth, one must also
consider the physical requirements for life--food, water, air, energy
fuels, materials for housing, and many other physical needs. When it
comes to a choice between these requirements and pieces of paper with
pictures of a politician printed on them, or any other kind of money,
then one must choose the physical requirements for life.
<P>
Consider, if you will, that in the U.S. for example, the total amount of
farmland has declined by 192 million acres in the past 30 years. This is
an average of about 6.4 million acres each year.  The world s arable
land is declining by an area the size of Wyoming each year. In the same
10 years, the time now required for the population to increase by a
billion people, 218 billion tons of topsoil is lost.
<P>
The increase in efficiency in the use of land can't keep up with this
double whammy of increasing population and the decreasing resources
required to supply the necessities of human life. Even now there are
more than a half-billion people who are undernourished and many who are
actually starving. It is already quite late; and, if humans can't--or
won't--control their population growth; if we can't--or won't--reduce
the deterioration of our environment, then nature will drastically
reduce our numbers by starvation.
<P>
Given the present population growth and the limitations of a declining
resource base, a collapse is almost certain. The only options are a
decline in birth rates and an increase in death tales -- or some
combination of both.
<P>
It has been great that medical knowledge has allowed us to go about the
world showing people how to prolong life, sometimes doubling the life
span up to a world average of 65 years. But--what have we done about
overpopulation except to refuse to admit that it exists?
<P>
The question must be asked: At the present rate of population growth how
long will it be before there is space for only one person per square
meter at arable soil?
<P>
For one reason or another many may refuse to believe that there are
limits that we may be closely approaching in the world's ability to
supply the necessities of  life for so many people, but it is certain
that the population is increasing at an unprecedented rate. And it is
certain that the necessary requirements to sustain life are being
depleted at an increasing rate as the population grows. The only
disagreement which is factually possible is how far can increasing
efficiency go in preventing these trends from converging at a point
where the earth can no longer support a further increase in population.
Before this point is reached (if it hasn't already) a decision should be
reached as to how low living standards should be allowed to decline in
order to support just what level of population. And a decision should be
made concerning what action is necessary. The longer this is postponed
the more difficult it becomes.
<P>
This is but one at the many problems that require solution, problems
which have become so interwoven, intermingled and interdependent that
they defy independent solutions. Historically when problems became too
complicated to be solved by witch-doctors and medicine men, and as
society outgrew their methods, those methods were very reluctantly
discarded. We have now reached the point where political and economic
methods of the past have become too antiquated. It is now obvious that
the highly technical problems on modern society on this Continent have
become entirely too complicated and too expensive for a
politico-economic system handed down from the dark ages. However, as
always, people are reluctant to move on into the future beyond these
antiquated methods. This far more complicated world now requires more
intelligence, more effective methods, and more accuracy in application,
otherwise a chaotic condition could develop much more rapidly than ever
before.
<P>
It is regrettable that so many changes are piling up at the same time,
but the very fact that they have is an indication that we haven't had
the leadership to provide a path into the future. If one can't accept
this, one need only look around at what is happening, read the news,
then ask oneself why these problems haven't already been solved--why so
many are not even in a process of being solved.
<P>
Science has been used with a lack of responsibility and a lack of
intelligence--but it is the MISUSE of science that contributes to our
social problems--war, ecological disasters, etc. Only scientific
solutions are possible in a social mechanism as complex as that now
existing on the North American Continent. It has been the scientific
method that has provided the knowledge to build this highly complex
technological structure--the scientific method that provided the
knowledge for doubling the human life span--and the scientific method
that made it possible for more than 5 billion people to live on this
planet--it must also be utilized to provide the knowledge to solve
population and ecological problems.
<P>
If one has been taught to believe that our technological progress is the
result of any political method, then that person has been victimized by
misinformation. It is not the fault of science that nature didn't
provide the physical necessities for an ever greater population.
However, science does have a solution for the problems created as a
result of all this progress to date. But in order for this solution to
be effected it is necessary that science be freed from the restrictions
of politics and from a financial system so antiquated that it is even
now in process of collapse due to its own inefficiency. Only
Technocracy's Technological Social Design can provide solutions for this
highly technical society and allow an age of peace and plenty.
