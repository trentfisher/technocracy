<h1>When Is There Over-Population?</h1>
<h2>Information Brief 44</h2>
<!--AUTHOR-->
<!--DATE--><h4>Jan. 1959</h4>
<hr>
<P>
Population densities on various parts of the earth have become so heavy 
that serious recognition of the situation and its attendant problems is 
being forced upon all people who are concerned with thinking and 
planning in the social field.  There is considerable disagreement over 
definition of terms and human objectives; so in many ways, the problem 
is confused.  But, whatever may be the views and thoughts of others on 
the subject, the analysis and social objectives of Technocracy are clear 
and definable.
<P>
There appear to be two general views on the subject of over-population, 
and these are almost diametrically opposed.  One view is that held by 
most scientists and social realists.  It contends that many parts of the 
earth are already too heavily populated, and that the earth as a whole 
has too many people.  These people are inclined to favor birth control 
programs in at least, the more densely populated sections of the globe.
<P>
The contrary view, held most often by disciples of authoritarianism, 
argues that the earth is not over-populated, and that many more people 
could be supported than now exist.  Supporters of this view even refuse 
to admit positively that any area is over-populated; although, when they 
are asked about Japan, Holland, Britain and Italy, among others, they 
resort to typical evasions.  This view is most strongly voiced by the 
adherents of certain religious cults which hold that there is virtue in 
having the maximum number of people that can be kept alive on an area.
<P>
This latter view is cleverly supported by the scholarly and, in some 
ways, brilliant work of Josue De Castro, in <cite>The Geography of
Hunger.</cite>
The former view is given solid positive support by the careful study and 
statistical evaluation of Robert Cook and his Population Reference 
Bureau, Washington, D.C. 
<P>
Those who favor immense population densities are extremely limited in 
their thinking about human needs.  They tend to think only in terms of 
food requirements.  Their arguments hover around the concept that, if a 
person has enough to eat to keep from dying -- or if there is a 
potential means of supplying them with this minimum amount of nourishment 
one cannot claim the existence of over-population.  They adroitly argue 
for the encouragement of more billions of people on the earth; through 
more intensive cultivation and production of food crops, and through a 
more equitable distribution of the world's food products.  They appear 
to be satisfied if there can be provided an average of half an acre of 
mediocre arable land for each of the world's inhabitants.  Conceivably, 
a person can be kept from dying on a half acre of moderately productive 
land, but, what else can he do?  Nothing.
<P>
The students of population who display a more scientific and 
appreciative concept of human requirements contend that each person 
requires a minimum of two acres of good land to supply them with 
adequate food, fiber and other organic crops.
<P>
<H3>Hazards to the General Welfare</H3>
<P>
But, a further insight into the problem reveals that food is not the 
most difficult and most critical of human requirements; that is, if we 
are to have any other objective in life than merely not starving to 
death on a day-to-day basis.  Long-term supplies of energy and metals 
present a more immediate urgency.  Even though we ignore the demands and 
desires of all other people on the earth, we can well ask with 
apprehension, ``For how long, and from where, will the people of the 
United States be able to obtain enough petroleum, sulphur, lead, zinc, 
copper and iron ore to maintain the standard of living of which they now 
boast?''
<P>
Before one can approach the subject of over-population, one must first 
define the technological stage of development and the general pattern of 
living to be dealt with.
<P>
Most people are satisfied with very little in the way of human comforts 
and all they require is that those comforts be not too hard to come by.  
But there is a certain percentage of people in all lands who have a 
strong urge to seek personal aggrandizement through a conspicuous 
display of wealth.  Those people seek to promote themselves into control 
of as much of the world's loot and authority as they can acquire, and 
the exact means of acquiring them are secondary.  However, predation and 
spoilation are the most favored means as these tend to get the most 
results in the least time, and with less need of personal ability, than 
any other means.
<P>
In any society the self-promoters are the great hazard to the general 
welfare.  They find their greatest satisfaction in reaching a high place 
in a fascistic order.  Any society that is to endure on a stable basis 
must be so organized that it can keep its self-promoters in check and 
not debase those who are short on luck or initiative.  The ultimate in 
alternatives would be a King Solomon with his myriads of slaves, a Nizam 
of Hyderabad with billions of dollars in personal wealth and surrounded 
by millions of wretched untouchables, or a Hitler with innumerable 
estates, schlosses and monuments, and slave battalions and death camps. 
<P>
<H3>Necessities of Life</H3>
<P>
Food is only one requirement of a population; but the quality and 
variety of that food are fully as important as the mere quantity.  
Undernourished or malnourished masses of humanity are no credit to 
humankind, however they may be regarded by certain spiritual 
authorities.  An adequate diet of tasty, nourishing and vitalizing food 
in a variety of forms for all of the inhabitants must be considered as a 
minimum requirement in defining the optimum population load of an area.
<P>
Housing is another factor in any standard of living; and, throughout the 
world there is a deficiency of comfortable housing.  Millions of people 
are without housing of any kind, relying on natural shelters or 
miscellaneous man-made structures to shield them from the worst of the 
weather.  Other millions live in mere tents, huts and mounds.  Before 
one can appraise an area from the standpoint of maximum allowable 
population, one must include the capability of providing all the 
inhabitants with suitable housing, and NOT the type of shoddy, costly 
houses that are now proliferating the suburbs of North America.
<P>
The amount of fresh water also is a potent limiting factor.  Lack of 
water renders huge areas of the earth's surface practically 
uninhabitable.  Until ways and means can be found for increasing the 
fresh water supply, many areas must remain restricted in their 
population density.  Water is needed for household uses, industrial 
uses, irrigation and recreation.  With an efficient program of water 
usage, and with restrictions on water wastage, plus conservation and 
replenishment of available water resources, this average requirement 
probably could be reduced somewhat for the Continent as a whole, and a 
greater population (as pertains to this one factor) could be permitted; 
but, even so, the increase would be finite and limited. 
<P>
Before it can be claimed that any specific area is NOT over-populated, 
it must be shown that adequate housing, as well as a healthful diet, can 
be provided for all the people living there.
<P>
<H3>Technocracy's Specifications</H3>
<P>
Obviously, certain parts of the earth are better suited to a heavier 
population density than others, especially if one thinks only of the 
food-producing capacity or some other one factor.  But, when considering 
all the factors which enter into a respectably high standard of living, 
we find no large area capable of sustaining a huge population on a self-
sustaining basis.  In order to have a spot as densely populated as New 
York City, for example, there must be a million square miles of ``back 
country'' to support it.
<P>
Although Technocracy Inc. may view the rest of the world with an 
analytical and critical eye, it concentrates its specification for a new 
social order on the North American Continent.  Technocracy specifies a 
high standard of living for the inhabitants of this Continent -- a 
standard of abundance for all.  Thus, Technocracy would impart to human 
beings a dignity and a standard of comfort and decency that no other 
organization attempts to approach, even in theory.
<P>
So, when Technocracy appraises the area of the Technate of North America 
from the standpoint of an optimum population, it takes into 
consideration the capacity of the Continent to sustain a standard of 
abundance for all of its inhabitants.
<P>
Technocracy sees no need for huge battalions of human toilers, hence 
does not go along with De Castro and others when they pose the need for 
human workers as an argument in favor of dense population loads.  
Technocracy recognizes the need for functional personnel to supervise 
the operation of an area, but does not view the work as being done with 
human toil.  We realize that with the present development of technology 
and the use of extraneous energy, only a fraction of the existing 
population of North America is required to operate the social mechanism 
and that, after the peak demands of the reconstruction period have 
passed, the future need will be much less. 
<P>
The criterion for establishing the limits of the allowable population 
load for this Continent should be the physical ability of the area to 
maintain that population at a standard of abundance for an indefinite 
period.
<P>
Descending from the above generalities, and applying statistical 
estimates to the problem, let us answer the question: ``How many people 
can the Technate area maintain at the standard which Technocracy 
specifies?''  Considering all the known and probable factors, that number 
would be in the vicinity of 200 million individuals, plus or minus 
twenty percent.  The lowest figure in this range is the number of people 
that are needed to operate the Continent without imposing a heavy load 
of effort upon anyone.  The highest figure in this range is the number 
that can be maintained without placing too much of a burden upon the 
resources of the Continent.
<P>
How is such a policy to be administered?  That is secondary; but, we can 
warn, that any program that relies upon voluntary human self-regulation 
is doomed to failure.  Technocracy merely proposes that scientists of 
this Continent be put in charge of administering the population control 
policy.
<P>
Once the population problem of North America is resolved on a firm 
basis, our technically skilled and experienced administrators could 
offer their services, in an advisory capacity, to other continents whose 
population problems have been permitted to get out of hand.
