<h1>Technocracy Plays North America To Win!</h1>
<H2>Information Brief Number 75</H2>
<!--AUTHOR--><h3></h3>

<p>
ARE YOU AWARE OF THE UNDERLYING CAUSES OF THE CRITICAL SITUATION 
WE ARE ENCOUNTERING TODAY?
<p>
DO YOU CONSIDER THAT YOU HAVE ANY REAL SOCIAL SECURITY OR THAT THE 
PRICE SYSTEM CAN PROVIDE IT FOR YOU?
<p>
DO YOU STILL RELY ON POLITICS AND POLITICIANS TO ELIMINATE POVERTY 
AND INSECURITY, CRIME AND DISEASE?
<p>
IS THERE ANY SOCIAL SYSTEM WHICH CAN PUT AN END TO THE BUNGLING 
AND CONFUSION WHICH HAS BECOME SO EVIDENT IN OUR SOCIAL SYSTEM IN 
THE LAST HALF CENTURY?
<p>
<h3>TECHNOCRACY, THE ORGANIZATION</h3>
<h4>What it is:</h4>
<p>
Technocracy Inc. is a non-profit membership organization 
incorporated under the laws of the State of New York.  It is a 
Continental Organization with offices and members in the principal 
countries of the North American Continent.  It is not a business 
organization, a financial racket, nor a political party.
<p>
Technocracy Inc. is the organizing vehicle for the dissemination 
of the specifications and designs of a new type of social control 
-- a Continental social mechanism with entirely new 
characteristics.
<p>
Technocracy Inc. is neither democratic nor autocratic; it is not a 
reform movement, and it runs no candidates for any public office.
<p>
Technocracy Inc. receives no financial subsidy or endowment, has 
no debts, and depends entirely on the dues and donations of its 
membership.  It pays subsistence allowances only to its full-time 
staff.
<p>
The Organization operates in full accord with the statutory legal 
requirements of the various countries concerned.  It is not a 
subversive, secret, or illegal body.
<p>
<h4>The Membership</h4>
<p>
Technocracy Inc. has only one class of membership, governed by the 
same regulations in all parts of the Continent.
<p>
Any individual who is a citizen or a legal, landed immigrant of 
continental North America (continental North America is comprised 
of Canada, United States, Mexico and northern South America) is 
eligible for membership in Technocracy Inc. -- with the following 
exceptions: No politicians or supporters of any political party 
are eligible for membership.
<p>
The annual membership dues are fifteen dollars.
<p>
Technocracy Inc. has no concern with the beliefs, morals, or 
religions of its members, nor of any other persons; this is an 
individual's private affair.  It is concerned only with the 
physical functioning of all social operations affecting the lives 
of the inhabitants of the North American Continent.
<p>
Technocrats come from all walks of life.  Their standing in the 
Organization depends on their ability to function as Technocrats 
and not upon their previous social status.
<p>
<h4>Operations of Technocracy Inc.</h4>
<p>
Technocracy Inc. operates only on the North American Continent 
through the structure of its Continental Headquarters, Regional 
Divisions, Sections and Organizers, as a self-controlled 
organization.  It has no affiliations with any other organization, 
movement, or association, whether in North America or elsewhere.
<p>
Technocracy Inc. conducts public meetings and publishes magazines 
and pamphlets by the efforts of its own membership.  It operates 
study classes and handles its own research and publicity.  It 
accepts only authenticated, standard information, statistics, and 
data.
<p>
Technocracy Inc. will be disbanded upon the establishment of the 
new social order.  The officers and members of Technocracy Inc. 
will fill only such positions as their ability will determine.  
This is in direct contradistinction to all political and corporate 
office seekers of today, all of whom expect personal 
aggrandizement or financial prestige through the perpetuation of 
the Price System.
<p>
Technocracy's work is based on a scientific analysis and synthesis 
of the social mechanism of the entire North American Continent.  
Technocracy derives nothing from and is opposed to communism, 
fascism, socialism, conservatism, liberalism, autocracy, 
and all other social philosophies such as democracy, which has 
become a heavily loaded propaganda word.
<h3>TECHNOCRACY, ITS ANALYSIS</h3>
<h4>Its Foundations</h4>
<p>
The greatest technological application of physical science in 
history has occurred on this Continent.  The technology of North 
America cannot be discarded or abandoned; more and more 
technological equipment will be installed.  The further 
advancement of technology will bring about social change 
regardless of economic, moral, or legal objections.  As more 
technology is installed, and as efficiency is increased, it 
produces more social instability on this Continent.
<p>
<h4>The Analysis</h4>
<p>
On this Continent the technological production of physical wealth 
has rendered the entire operational complex so tenuous and 
vulnerable that it cannot permit of a communistic revolution, a 
fascistic coup d'etat, nor the continuation of democratic 
compromise.  These social tactics can have no other result than 
chaos.
<p>
Technocracy finds that the production and distribution of an 
abundance of physical wealth on a Continental scale can only be 
accomplished by a Continental technological control -- a 
government of function.
<p>
Technocracy declares that the distribution of abundance cannot be 
carried out by political party legislation, labor union activity, 
or corporate and business enterprise.  Our technology demands a 
balanced-load operation of all equipment -- a balance between 
production and distribution, with responsible concern that we do 
not waste our natural resources. 
<p>
<h4>The Resultants</h4>
<p>
Technocracy states that the distribution of goods and services can 
only be accomplished by means of a Continental accounting system, 
based on energy conversion, that will effect the continuous 
recording of production, distribution, and consumption.  No 
process of evaluation nor the use of any medium of exchange 
(money) can be employed as a record of transactions in the 
production of goods and services.
<p>
Technocracy points out that in a technological administration 
the governing body would be completely responsible for the design, 
construction, operation, and maintenance of the physical equipment 
of the Continent.  They would be responsible for the economic 
livelihood of each and every citizen.  These conditions would 
ensure complete social security for all.  It will be the first 
time in history that this has occurred.  No government of politics 
can provide social security.  No philosophically conceived 
government, past or present, can accept and fulfill the 
responsibility for the maintenance of its individual citizens.  No 
such government can ever provide social security.
<p>
<h4>Security for North Americans</h4>
<p>
Technocracy states that the operation of the social mechanism of 
North America by a technological control would provide every 
inhabitant with a high standard of living, equal (but not 
identical, because wants differ) income, and economic security 
from birth to death with a minimum of human toil.
<p>
All political parties promise only reforms of society within the 
frame of this Price System (which is based on humanitarian concepts, 
wishfulfillment and human desires.)  None of these meet the 
demands of technology.  Technocracy, in contrast, offers the 
specifications and blueprints of Continental physical operations 
for the production of goods and services for every citizen.
<p>
TECHNOCRACY STATES THAT YOU ARE BEING DELUGED WITH PROPAGANDA 
DESIGNED TO DECEIVE YOU AS TO THE ISSUES AT STAKE.
<p>
TECHNOCRACY TELLS YOU WHERE YOU STAND TODAY, AND WHAT THE FUTURE 
HOLDS FOR YOU.
<p>
TECHNOCRACY WARNS YOU NOT TO `SELL NORTH AMERICA SHORT' BUT `PLAY 
NORTH AMERICA TO WIN.'
