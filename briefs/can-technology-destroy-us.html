<H2>Can Technology Destroy Us?</H2>
<H3>YES!</H3>
<P>
Technology, the application of science to industry, has given us a
lifestyle unheard of even hundred years ago. In the uncontrolled quest
for profit, it has also brought about unimaginable changes in the
Earth we require to sustain ourselves.
<P>
The question is: CAN WE SURVIVE BY CONTINUING TO OPERATE AS WE HAVE IN
THE PAST?
<P>
<H3>TECHNOCRACY SAYS NO!</H3>
<P>
It would be impossible, and entirely insufficient, to attempt to
explain the broad scope of Technocracy's concepts in a few words.
This informational article is only to inform the reader in a very
general way of the basic tenets of functional governance of the
Continent of North America and to impress upon the reader the
necessity of familiarizing oneself with the total program of
scientific government through a study of Technocracy's abundant
literature.
<P>
<H3>WHAT IS TECHNOCRACY?</H3>
<P>
A distinction should be made at the outset between Technocracy Inc.,
the organization, and Technocracy's Technological Social Design.
Technocracy Inc., is a research and educational organization formed in
1933 as an outgrowth of the Technical Alliance, a distinguished group
of scientists, engineers, economists, and educators formed in late
1918 to study the effects of technology on our social structure. For
some 14 years this group gathered data and came up with the following
conclusions:
<ol>
  <li>The continent of North America contains sufficient resources to
      provide every man, woman and child with an optimum standard of living.
  <li>We have both the technological know-how and the physical machinery
      to realize this goal.
  <li>In the face of advancing technology, human labor is being replaced,
      thus removing consuming power from a large portion of the population.
      Therefore, we must seek another means of distribution of goods and
      services to all citizens.
</ol>
<P>
On the basis of these findings, Technocracy, Inc. has formulated a
plan for a scientific social design, a Technocracy in working form.
<P>
<H3>SO WHAT DOES THIS MEAN TO ME?</H3>
<P>
Simply this: the Price System -- which Technocracy defines as any
system that operates on debt, and uses a medium of exchange to
distribute goods and services -- that we have relied on for thousands
of years is breaking down in the face of advancing technology. We must
either choose to adopt a system of operation in keeping with our
technologies, or continue to see a rise in debt, taxes, crime,
pollution, hunger, homelessness, and a growing list of other social
and environmental problems.
<P>
In dealing with finite resources, it should be obvious that we cannot
continue to measure them in terms of something as unstable as
negotiable currency. We can churn out paper currency as long as the
trees hold out, but we can't create a planet.
<P>
A scientific operation of the physical plant of our continent would
place the management of our resources and technology squarely in the
hands of the technicians most qualified, not in the hands of
politicians and business interests, as they are now.
<P>
<H3>YOU MEAN THE PRICE SYSTEM IS BEHIND ALL OUR PROBLEMS?</H3>
<P>
As technology increases our ability to consume resources, and we
maintain a throw-away society to protect our Price System economy, we
must ultimately choose between an inappropriate system and our
survival.
<P>
<H3>BUT HASN'T MONEY GIVEN US OUR HIGH STANDARD OF LIVING?</H3>
<P>
Money, no. Science and technology, yes. Businesses deal in profit and
seek out needs to exploit. If they can't find a need, they create one,
a practice that has resulted in the creation of a multitude of
non-essential enterprises, and a gross wastage of irreplaceable
resources.
<P>
In reality, a high standard of living depends on the availability of
resources and the development and equitable apportionment of
them. Money does not do that; money is a means of distributing a
scarcity.
<P>
Science makes no moral judgment, nor does Technocracy pass any
judgment on the monetary system. Technocracy only deals with what is
workable and efficient. And Technocracy's findings certainly can't
speak as loudly as the deteriorating state of our planet and our
worldwide standard of living as to the ineffectiveness of the world
monetary system.
<P>
<H3>WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO WITH SOCIETY?</H3>
<P>
Everything. Bear in mind that conditions dictate actions.  Except for
psychopathic behavior, every anti-social incident we witness -- every
act of violence, every drug deal, every theft, every time someone is
cheated or robbed -- is indicative of a need not being met. Taken as a
whole, they indicate a societal trend, and every trend has an
underlying cause. The increase in these incidents we are witnessing
doesn't mean people have become bad, just that the breakdown in the
system forces them into an unnatural predatory state.
<P>
<H3>WHY ISN'T TECHNOCRACY MORE WELL-KNOWN?</H3>
<P>
For the simple reason that, so far, through things as varied as wars
and drug trade, we have managed to inject enough revenue to keep our
debt structure going. Also, the fact that business and politics
haven't found a way to use the program to their advantage probably has
a lot to do with it. These things, plus the fact that things haven't
deteriorated to such a state that people start looking for hard
solutions.  But we're getting there.
<P>
<H3>IS TECHNOCRACY A WORLD-WIDE PLAN?</H3>
<P>
No, it is confined to the land area of North America and its environs,
for no other reason than that of geography.  There are physical
barriers in the form of oceans that separate us from the rest of the
world. This does not mean that we intend to disregard the rest of the
world. If asked, we can, no doubt, find ways to help other people
without dictating to them.
<P>
<H3>WHAT IS THE HARDEST CHALLENGE TECHNOCRACY
FACES IN GETTING ITS MESSAGE ACROSS?</H3>
<P>
The biggest roadblocks to Technocracy's efforts are the concepts of
debt and the tendency of the operators of the monetary system to view
the individual solely as a revenue-generating device.  This, along
with much of our crime, and most of our unmet material wants would
disappear when each person is guaranteed a high standard of living as
a right of citizenship, free of the demands of a Price System.
<P>
Thousands of years of human conditioning have convinced us that we
need a huge, non-real economic structure to supply our needs, and 'hat
we must slave away to support it. This is a particularly hard point to
get across in a sy,-item which is trying hard to salvage itself by
injecting an unprecedented sense of money-consciousness.
<P>
<H3>HAS ANYONE EVER TRIED TECHNOCRATIC SYSTEM?</H3>
<P>
No, because up until the early part of this century, such a system
would not have been possible. The labor-for-wages system still worked.
<P>
And so, incidentally, did people.
<P>
<H3>WHAT ABOUT THE INDIVIDUAL'S SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY?</H3>
<P>
It is the social responsibility of each member of a society to be of
some benefit to that society, totally in accordance with his or her
individual capabilities. This can be done with a minimum of effort,
and does not mean that in doing so we must enslave ourselves to an
economic structure which daily proves itself ever more incapable of
social responsibility.
<P>
<H3>WHY CAN'T OUR LEADERS DEAL WITH OUR PROBLEMS?</H3>
<H3>HOW ABOUT ENVIRONMENTAL AND CONSUMER GROUPS?</H3>
<P>
Our problems are technical, not political or economic.  Elected
officials simply do not have the know-how to deal with them. They know
how to legislate the actions of people, not the workings of the earth.
Moreover, each elected official would be committing political suicide
if he failed to address the parochial interests of his own
constituents. His entire attention has been in seeking office and
therefore is incapable of approaching the problems of the continent as
a whole.
<P>
An appropriate analogy of a legislative approach to a physical problem
would be that of a drowning man who has ignored the "No Swimming"
sign. We can't save him by shouting and pointing to the sign or by
threatening him with a fine. He doesn't need laws or someone
trying to sell him a life preserver.  He needs saving.  So it is with
our social and environmental problems.  Why look to the system that
caused these problems to remedy them?
<P>
As far as consumer and environmental groups go, each must dance to the
tune of the financial structure. As an example, a recent publication of
one particularly popular environmental group featured an article on
the necessity of minimizing pollution by cutting back on the operation
of private automobiles. In the same issue, it carried two separate
advertisements for automobile manufacturers.
<P>
<h3>WHAT CAN I EXPECT TO SEE IF WE CONTINUE OUR PRESENT OPERATION?</h3>
<P>
Bear in mind that the Price System, which was born in the days of hand
tools and oxcarts and can only exist in a condition of scarcity
production, that is, goods being withheld from people to maintain
profit margins, has been living on borrowed time.  Continuation of the
Price System can only result in  higher prices and taxes, more
cheaply-made goods, further cutbacks in human services, the
concentration of money into fewer hands, your children's educations
and your welfare being directed by huge, profit-oriented corporations,
more environmental degradation, more prisons, more crime, more
substance abuse, wars -- all the things at which we shake our heads
and click our tongues and then finally write off as the inevitable
prices we pay for our freedoms.
<P>
<H3>WHAT CAN I EXPECT FROM A TECHNOCRATIC OPERATION?</H3>
<P>
First, and most innovative, would be a replacement of our Price System
with an energy-based economy, in which each individual would be
guaranteed an equally high standard of living, based on availability
of resources, and distributed through a personal, non-transferable
certificate, much like a credit card but without the debt. A removal
of money would automatically cause a dramatic drop in all
money-related crime and a number of other social problems that are
basically financial in nature. For the first time in history,
production would be based entirely on need, not on profit. Also, for
the first time in history, we would start living, not struggling to
make a living.
<P>
Under a scientific system. "I owe, I owe, so off to work I go" would
be replaced with "I'm needed, so off to work I go." Not quite as
lyrical, but much more inspiring.
<P>
<H3>WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY "START LIVING?"</H3>
<P>
With totally automated factories operating twenty-four hours a day
with their production keyed to consumer demands during the previous
24-hour period, with an integrated continental transportation system;
with environmental protection; with balanced loads on roads and
recreational facilities; with continental water management, with
environmentally planned city centers with efficient quality housing,
with abundant food and state of the art medical care -- and with the
opportunity to work at a job you like, not one you need to
survive. With conditions like this, we should see a blossoming of
creative expression. Technocracy estimates that, at present, by
clinging to the Price System, we are ignoring what could be enjoyed --
individual consuming power equivalent to an annual income of $82,000
(1989 estimate). No insurance, no lawsuits, no taxes -- all as a right
of citizenship.
<P>
In short, survival, in the best style possible.
