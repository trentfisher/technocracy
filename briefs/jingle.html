<h1>From A Jingle In The Pocket To A Renaissance Of Mind</h1>

<blockquote>
Could the solution to all of North America's fiscal, employment,
environmental and social problems be waiting in the wings for an
informed population to cue its entrance to center stage?  Is the
present deficit imaginary?  Is the monetary system, as we know it
make-believe? To all these questions Technocrats would answer,
``Yes.''
</blockquote>
<P>
Technocracy had its inception in 1919 in New York City, when a group
of educators and other professionals, led by Howard Scott, a
consulting and industrial engineer, formed an organization known as
the Technical Alliance of North America.
<P>
The group discussed the many ramifications of the "Price System," any
system that distributes its goods and services on a basis of commodity
valuation, and employs any form of &quot;debt tokens&quot; or money.
Included in that definition was every major system in the world from
capitalism through fascism to communism.  Whatever their form, the
Technocrats concluded, all were geared to conditions of natural
scarcity and hence were unsuitable for the distribution of abundance.
<P>
The primary aim of the Technical Alliance was to explore the
application of scientific achievements to social and industrial
affairs.  They made a survey of the natural resources of this
continent as a geographical unit and the industrial evolution that has
taken place therein.  They showed graphically the operating
characteristics of the present industrial system with all its waste of
finite resources and worked out a tentative design for a completely
coordinated system of production and distribution.
<P>
From the harnessing of steam power, the greatest impact of developing
technology was in the broadening of the array of goods and services
available to the public coupled with a lessening of the human
work-load.  There was, generally, enough to eat and, from time to
time, even a choice of foods.  Freed from the drudgery of 72 hour-work
weeks, ordinary people began to plan for their future.  New jobs
created by the expanding technology masked, for a while, the
inevitable loss of employment to the machines being built.
<P>
Early in the twentieth century, refinement of the mechanical assembly
line initiated changes greater than any witnessed by humans since they
captured fire and made it portable.  Almost overnight, North America
went from a position of scarcity, to one of abundance.  For the first
time in history, a population had the capability of producing more
than it could consume.
<P>
But the dreamless, mindless machines that replaced people in the
workplace were immune to want or need.  They could not be induced to
buy and consume.  People thrown out of work could not purchase what
the machines produced.  By 1927, goods began to pile up on warehouse
shelves.  The market system was nearing the end of its natural life.
In 1929, the stock market crashed.  North America awoke from its dream
of prosperity to the nightmare of The Great Depression.  Into this
environment, Technocracy was introduced to North America.
<P>
After nearly fourteen years of research, when the Technical Alliance's
work, as such, was nearing completion, an enterprising reporter heard
that something of more than casual interest was taking place at
Columbia University.  He spilled the story, somewhat prematurely,
incorrect and misleading, to his New York daily newspaper.
Banner-line front-page coverage spread rapidly across the continent.
<P>
It became apparent to the Technical Alliance that publicity measures
they had planned for their findings would have to be implemented
immediately to counter the misinformation.  The Technical Alliance was
disbanded; a new organization, Technocracy Incorporated, was formed.
On March 3, 1933, the organization was incorporated under the laws of
the State of New York as a non-sectarian, education research
membership organization.  Training of public speakers and the
formation of study classes on a continental scale quickly followed.
<P>
In the social upheaval of the Great Depression Technocracy quickly
became a popular idea.  People applied for membership; their dues,
financed a continent-wide educational campaign.  A network of
volunteers spread out across the length and breadth of North
America. In outdoor gatherings, private houses, community, halls and
auditoriums, growing numbers of citizens came to hear Technocracy's
speakers.  News stories, editorials, and political cartoons featured
in the leading newspapers of that era, attest to the organization's
impact.
<P>
What would account for Technocracy's popularity?  The explanation is
probably quite simple. The people in the depression era were living
intimately with an example of  a profit-driven technology gone sadly
askew.  Disemployment by laborsaving technology had destroyed the
new-found sense of security that had been building throughout North
America.  Many families, deprived of paychecks, were turned out of
their homes by banks and other financial institutions holding
mortgages.  In cities, many, perhaps most, were reduced to eating one
meal a day.  Thousands of men hit the continent's roads in a futile
search for work and ended up living transient lives in hobo jungles or
government relief camps, where they worked for room and board, such as
it was.  The radical restructuring proposed by Technocracy made sense
to a lot of people.
<P>
Technocracy's proposed plan is a scientific/social design to produce
and distribute a virtual abundance equally to ALL North Americans with
the least possible wastage of nonrenewable resources, a minimum of
human effort, and a maximum of efficiency.  The industrial mechanism
would operate 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.  Efficiency could
achieve required production with less infrastructure.  Goods would be
better built to last longer, eliminating built- in obsolescence and
lessening the production equipment necessary.  Products, wherever
possible, would be designed with total recycling capability thereby
decreasing the on non-renewable resources.
<P>
A viable method indicated by Technocracy's calendar would show the
population, from age 25 to retirement at 45, working four days
on-three days off for 287 days (165 which are work days) plus 78 days
vacation per year.  Technological improvements since 1933 have
shortened work time considerably.  Citizens up to age 25 would receive
education and training.  <em>In their greatly increased leisure time,
people would have an opportunity to engage in a variety of familial,
introspective, artistic, scientific or sporting pursuits or extensive
travel.</em>
<P>
Money, as we know it, would be replaced with a non-fluctuating medium
of distribution.  Instead of having an "elastic value" (supply and
demand) as at present, goods would possess a measurable energy input
and would be distributed on that basis.  The total "cost" of all goods
and services produced would be the total amount of all energy used in
their production.  Personal consuming power would be issued to all
citizens throughout their lives, in a form of non-negotiable
accounting.  It would be used only by the person to whom it was issued
as a medium of distribution.  In modern usage it would likely resemble
(physically) the credit card but there the similarity would end.  In
conjunction with a modem computer system it would be in a continual
accounting system (detailing expenditure of energy and natural
resources), a continuous inventory, an identification and record of
the holder and a guarantee of security.  Unlike the credit card, it
would NOT be: a medium of exchange, subject to fluctuation of "value",
subject to theft or loss, subject to hoarding or gambling, a symbol of
wealth or prestige, a means of creating debt.  It would be useless to
everyone except the person to whom it was issued.  There would be no
personal "saving": the unused remainder of individual's energy account
would be canceled out at two-year intervals and replaced with a new
account.  Banks would cease to exist.
<p>
<strong>THE HOPE OF FINDING SUSTAINABILITY WITHIN THE CONFINES OF
THE PROFIT-DRIVEN MARKET SYSTEM CAN ONLY BE COMPARED
TO HOPING TO DINE ON RAINBOWS.</strong>
<P>
In a Technocracy, private property would become obsolete.  All
"property", technological development and production including
automobiles and housing would be owned equally and in common by the,
population of North America.  Personal choices in housing would be
allocated according to need; car usage would be accessed by the Energy
Certificate in much the same way &quot;U-Drives&quot; are now
obtained.  Public transportation would be developed to the limits of
technology and imagination.  Automobile production would drop to about
10% of present numbers.  Mortgages, car payments, maintenance and
insurance, debt and all taxes would be nonexistent.
<P>
&quot;Leaders&quot; in a Technocracy would be selected by the vertical
alignment method in much the same way that industry now selects its
supervisory staff.  Promotion would involve recommendation from below
and appointment from above, competence being the predominant factor in
the choice.  In reality, persons of special ability would be promoted
to positions of responsibility by peer encouragement.  Gone would be
political parties, obscene perks and pensions to government members,
political/corporate liaisons and graft.  Gone, in fact, would be the
corporations, trade and commerce.
<P>
Technocracy today, is a faint shadow of the organization that existed
in the depression years.  What happened?
<P>
In a desperate move to bring America out of depression, President
F. D. Roosevelt caved in to corporate pressure.  Together they cooked
up one of the most ill-conceived legislations of all time.  It would
become known as The New Deal, a program promoting, among other
measures, legislated waste on a massive scale.  Bulging warehouses
were emptied, their contents hauled to special dumps, where they were
run over by bulldozers and buried.  Goods that manufacturers could not
sell during the lean depression years were systematically destroyed to
create an artificial scarcity, corporations being compensated in part
for their "loss" by cash payments and tax concessions.  Hiring offices
opened their doors a tiny crack and workers lined up for the few jobs
offered.  North America put the market system on artificial life
support and took its first tentative step toward unsustainability.
<P>
From 1939 to 1945 most of the world went to war.  North America put
its factories on full production and opened wide the hiring office
doors.  Those who didn't go to war went to work.
<P>
After the war, the veterans returned to a vastly changed continent.
The factories didn't suddenly gear down at the cessation of
hostilities.  Europe was in ruins.  There was opportunity for foreign
markets.  Billions of dollars worth of armaments were manufactured and
sold to countries that couldn't even provide food for their citizens.
<P>
Here at home the domestic market increased.  Banks created money by
providing easy loans so people could access the abundance of goods
being produced.  Governments turned a blind eye to planned
obsolescence.  And the population, hedonistic and with quickened pace,
went willingly down the road that must, if continued, lead to the
exhaustion of ALL finite resources.  And yet, the hunger for foreign
Markets continues.
<P>
In 1998 sustainability is the word on almost every lip.  Governments
are caught in the middle between environmentalists demanding and
corporations promising sustainability.  And the hope of finding
sustainability within the confines of the profit-driven market can
only be compared to hoping to dine on rainbows.
<P>
The future of our grandchildren is being mortgaged to the profits of
the privileged, and the world's richest continent may not be able to
fulfill its obligation to all the people of the planet to set up an
example of sustainability.
<P>
But the Technocrats are still here waiting with their plan.
Technocracy Inc. is listed in the directories of cities across Canada
and America.  Their 59-page publication entitled
<a href="../ttsd/index.html">Technocracy: Technological Social Design</a>,
detailing every aspect of their proposal
and organization, bears intense examination.  The Technocrats would
welcome that.
