TECHNOCRACY is science in the social field. The Encyclopedia Americana
has said: `Whatever the future of Technocracy, one must fairly say that
it is the only program of social and economic reconstruction which is in
complete intellectual and technical accord with the age in which we
live.' The late H.G. Wells stated: `Essentially Technocracy is a soundly
scientific effort to restate economics on a purely physical basis.' The
Concise Oxford Dictionary defines Technocracy as an `Organization and
management of a country's industrial resources by technical experts for
the good of the whole community.' These definitions all say much the
same thing but in different words.
<P>
The studies of Technocracy embrace the entire fields of science and
industry. Biology, climate, natural resources, and industrial equipment
all enter into the social picture. Technocracy is dealing with social
phenomena in the widest sense of the word, including not only actions of
human beings, but also everything which directly or indirectly affects
their actions. No one can expect to have any understanding of our
present social problems without having at least a panoramic view of the
basic relationships of these essential elements of the picture. The
purpose of our studies is not to give any person a comprehensive
knowledge of science and technology, but rather to present an outline of
the essential elements of these various fields, as they pertain to the
social problem, in a unified picture. The important thing, at this stage
of social development, is to get a comprehensive picture of the problem
as a whole, rather than of its parts as unrelated scraps of knowledge.
Technocrats learn through their Study Course to see this Continent as it
really is and to understand how it must be operated functionally so as
to result in the most benefit to all, including future generations yet
unborn.
<P>
Technocracy originated in the winter of 1918-19 when Howard Scott formed
a group of scientists, engineers, and economists that became known as
the Technical Alliance--a research organization. Howard Scott was chief
engineer of this group. The Alliance lasted about fourteen years. Its
membership embraced many of America's top scientists and engineers,
including such personalities as: Frederick Ackerman, architect; Leland
Olds, statistician; Thorstein Veblen, economist; L. K. Comstock,
electrical engineer, and Charles Steinmetz. It conducted what became
known as the famous 'Energy Survey of North America.' Out of the survey,
and under the guiding genius of Howard Scott, there emerged a completely
new way of looking at life and human affairs. The social assets and
liabilities (in a physical sense) of North America were laid bare for
the first time. The social trends and tendencies were analyzed
scientifically and for the first time in history a continental area
(North America) had a glimpse of its future, or at least of the broad
alternatives.
<P>
<H3>TECHNOCRACY INC.</H3>
<P>
By 1930 the group had become known as Technocracy. In 1933 it was
incorporated under the laws of the State of New York as a non-political,
non-sectarian, non-profit membership organization. The new organization
could then take in laymen for education and teaching purposes.
Technocracy has no political antecedents. It derives nothing from any of
the historic political theorists such as Adam Smith, David Ricardo or
Karl Marx. The basic views of Technocracy derive (embryonically) from
the works of Joseph Willard Gibbs, the father of physical chemistry. It
was Gibbs who placed the science of thermodynamics on a sound footing;
and he emphasized that every process in nature means change. He
discovered some of the laws of physical change.
<P>
From Thales of Miletus on through such landmark names as Galileo,
Kepler, Newton, Lord Kelvin, Willard Gibbs, to Howard Scott, science has
been one grand historic march of discovery and progress. Howard Scott is
the man, the genius, who first recognized the physical basis of social
change, the laws of physical change in human society. He applied the
scientific method to the study of social phenomena and the social
mechanism, substituting a 'metrical' for a 'value' interpretation.
<P>
Technocracy's survey of the economic situation in North America leads to
the conclusion that there is in development a process of progressive
social instability; that this process will continue until the
instability reaches the limit of social tolerance, and that there then
will have to be installed on this Continent a social mechanism competent
to meet the needs of its people. Technocracy finds further that the day
when social operations on this Continent can be based on a system of
'values' has passed, and that it is now necessary that there be applied
in the social field the quantitative methods of physical science.
<P>
Technocracy proposes that the North American Continent be operated as a
self-contained functional unit under technological control. This control
would operate the area under a balanced-load system of production and
distribution, whereunder there would be distributed purchasing power
commensurate with the resources and the continuous full-load operation
of the physical equipment, with the guarantee of a high standard of
living, equality of income and economic security to every inhabitant,
with a minimum of human toil.
<P>
Technocracy Inc. (the organization as such) is a means to an end, the
end being to assist with the installation of a social system whereby the
Continent may be operated according to the needs and wants of its
population. These desires will be expressed through a scientifically
operated social system so that an abundance of goods and services can be
produced <EM>and distributed</EM> with a minimum of human effort. To insure the
continuation of that high energy social system, a careful husbanding of
natural resources and an intelligent strategy for continental defense
will be necessary.
<P>
At this stage the objectives of Technocracy are, first, the education of
the people of North America to a recognition of the reasons behind the
social crisis and, second, the organization of all those willing to
study and interest themselves into an informed, disciplined and
functionally capable body whose knowledge and ability can be called upon
to prevent chaos in North America at that time, now imminent, when the
Price System can no longer be made to operate.
<P>
<H3>TECHNOCRACY'S EMBLEM</H3>
<P>
The emblem of Technocracy (shown on the
<A HREF="../index.html">Technocracy Home Page</A>) is the Monad, an
ancient generic symbol signifying <EM>dynamic balance</EM>.
It is the symbol of our Organization and of our outlook and body of thought.
Technocracy is not a monetary scheme. It is, in a sense, a plan;
covering so many avenues of function that it could be aptly described
as a completely new dimension of thought. Moreover It is not a fixed
plan; it is an overall, flexible, dynamic, skeletal plan. We cannot
expect to settle everything for all the future generations now.
<P>
Technocrats are not high-pressure salesmen. We want as members only
those persons who come into our Organization through conviction. All we
ask is to be heard, that our analysis be examined carefully, critically,
from a strictly factual standpoint. We insist that the facts cannot be
hidden for very much longer. As conditions in our social mechanism
become increasingly unstable, more and  more people will be looking for
an answer to their problems. When they come to us we are here ready to
explain our findings and our program. Technocracy Inc. is the only
organization with a prepared plan, ready to be adopted when enough
citizens of North America demand social change and have the courage to
really do something about it.
<P>
Today we have poverty in the midst of plenty. Food is stored and
destroyed to keep up prices while people on this Continent go hungry and
are in want. North Americans must install a new social system which
<EM>can</EM> distribute abundance to all citizens. Albert Einstein
once said: 'We are at the dawn of a new world. Scientists have given
to men considerable powers. Politicians have seized hold of them. The
world must choose between the unspeakable desolation of mechanization
for profit or conquest, and the lusty youthfulness of science and
technique serving the social needs of a new civilization.'
<P>
You could be amongst those people who are aware of the instability of
our present social mechanism; and maybe you feel that it is about time
you did something about it. But it is quite possible that you do not
know anyone who is a Technocrat, and have no idea how to go about
obtaining more information. A letter sent to Continental Headquarters,
or to some other address shown on this leaflet, will bring you more
information and possibly put you in touch with a group of members that
is within  a reasonable distance from you.
<P>
You may agree in part or fully with Technocracy's program, in which case
it is your duty and obligation to yourself and to those you care for to
study this  Organization and its body of thought. Join with the
Technocrats in their efforts to enlighten the citizens of North America,
so that they may understand the nature of the economic mess we are in at
present and realize how severe the economic chaos may be when it
confronts them in the future. They can then help avert the approaching
debacle and assist in preparing for the next most probable state of
society--by installing the only suitable plan available to them:
Technocracy.
<P>
We urge you to keep in mind that this job of enlightenment of the
population must be done; it is no small undertaking, and the time is
running short. Although Technocrats have availed themselves of the
method, they cannot hope for success without support. Further, it is no
more their task than it is that of yourself or any other North American
to get the job done.
<P>
<H3>MAY WE EXPECT TO SEE YOU SOON?</H3>
