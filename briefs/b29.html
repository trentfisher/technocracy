<H3>Obsolete System</H3>
<P>
The Price System grew out of the days of scarcity, when trading his
crude materials or stealing them, was the only way in which man could
acquire the articles which he required. Through complex ramifications
the trading system has grown until it is now the overwhelming structure
of finance, business commerce, and politics, in short, the Price System
in toto--a gigantic structure, but still just a method of exchanging
goods, springing from the ancient custom and necessity of barter. No
intention or pretense is made of accurate measurement or control; no
physical accounting is involved; no accurate predictions can be made;
and no stabilization can be assured. The Price System is simply a method
of erratic exchange. In scarcity it sufficed well enough as an exchange
method; in abundance it cannot even do that.
<P>
The dislocation of the commodity exchange method of distributing goods
and services became apparent after World War 1. The disrupted conditions
at that time led to a scientific investigation which in turn proved that
the only common denominator of all goods and services was energy.
<P>
The scientists who pointed this out simply proposed to measure the total
amount of energy used by the North American Continent in a given period;
measure the energy cost of physical production and services; and use
these measurements as the basis for regulation of all Continental
production and distribution.
<P>
<H3>Technocracy Is The Tool</H3>
<P>
Technocracy's basic postulate is, `The phenomena involved in the
functional operation of a social mechanism are metrical.' In other
words, anything that materially affects us or changes our environment is
measurable. The scientists and technologists know this and have applied
it directly to the task of equipping North America with the most
intricate and efficient productive mechanism ever to exist on earth.
When they are given their chance they will see that the abundant goods
and services produced are adequately distributed to everyone on the
Continent. Technocracy is the tool by which North Americans may gain
abundance and security.
<P>
Technocracy would put into operation a Continental control of all flow
lines of production and distribution a Continental statistical system
which would record the desires of every citizen in his choice of
consumable goods and available services. This system would do the
following things in a physical area where abundance is certain:
<OL>
<LI>Register on a continuous 24-hour-per day basis the total net
conversion of energy, which would determine (a) the availability of
energy for Continental plant construction and maintenance, (b) the
amount of physical wealth available in the form of consumable
goods and services for  consumption by the total population
during the balance-load period.
<LI>By means of the registration of energy converted and consumed, make
possible a balanced load.
<LI>Provide a continuous inventory of all production and consumption.
<LI>Provide a specific registration of the type, kind, etc., of all
goods and services, where produced, and where used.
<LI>Provide a specific registration of the consumption of each
individual, plus a record and description of  the individual.
<LI>Allow the citizen the widest latitude of choice in consuming his
individual share of Continental physical wealth.
<LI>Distribute goods and services abundantly to every member of the
population.
</OL>
<P>
<H3>Why Not Money?</H3>
<P>
On the basis of these requirements, it is interesting to consider money
as a possible medium of distribution. But before doing this, let us bear
in mind what the properties of money are. In the first place, money
relationships are all based upon 'value,' which in turn is a function of
scarcity. Hence money is not a 'measure' of anything. Secondly, money is
a debt claim against society and is valid in the hands of any bearer. In
other words, it is negotiable; it can be traded, stolen, given or
gambled away. Thirdly, money can be saved. Fourthly, money circulates,
and is not destroyed or canceled out upon being spent. On each of these
counts money fails to meet our requirements as our medium of
distribution.
<P>
<H3>Money Is Inadequate</H3>
<P>
Suppose, for instance, that we attempted to distribute by means of money
the goods and services produced. Suppose that it were decided that 200
billion dollars' worth of goods and services were to be produced in a
given year, and suppose further that 200 billion dollars were
distributed to the population during that time with which to purchase
these goods and services. Immediately the foregoing properties of money
would create trouble. Due to the fact that money is not a physical
measure of goods and services, there is no assurance that prices would
not change during the year, and that 200 billion dollars issued for use
in a given year would be used in that year. If it were not used this
would immediately begin to curtail production and start oscillations.
Due to the fact that money is negotiable, and that certain human beings,
by hook or crook, have a facility for getting it away from other human
beings, this would defeat the requirement that distribution must reach
all human beings. A further consequence of the negotiability of money is
that it can be used very effectively for purposes of bribery. Hence the
most successful accumulators of money would be able eventually not only
to disrupt the flow line, but also to buy a controlling interest in the
social mechanism itself, which brings us right back to where we started
from.
<P>
Due to the fact that money is a species of debt, and hence cumulative,
the amount would have to be continuously increased, which, in
conjunction with its property of being negotiable, would lead inevitably
to concentration of control in a few hands, and to general disruption of
the distribution system which was supposed to be maintained.
<P>
Thus, money in any form whatsoever is completely inadequate as a medium
of distribution in an economy of abundance with a Price System control.
Any social system employing commodity evaluation (commodity valuations
are the basis of all money) is a Price System. Hence it is not possible
to maintain an economy of abundance by means of a Price System.
<P>
<H3>The Scientific Answer</H3>
<P>
Technocracy's Energy Certificate is the only instrument of distribution
which can be used in this Continent's emerging era of abundance--the
progress of which is being speeded up by automation. This Energy
Certificate provides the accounting means whereby each individual North
American can express his individual preference as to what he wants of
the products North America is capable of producing. That is its
function--to record the demand for goods and services and, thereby, to
determine the amount to be produced.  By applying one specific
technological measuring device, production and consumption can be
balanced and the first specification for social harmony is immediately
achievable.
<P>
<H3>Vote With Meaning</H3>
<P>
The only real vote is purchasing power. What we buy we vote for. With an
abundance of purchasing power we can vote as often as we like, every day
of the year, and always win our vote.
<P>
The Energy Certificate eliminates both the basis and the need of all
social work and charity. It would reduce crime to but a small fraction
of what exists today.
<P>
If you don't like the war, the poverty, the misery, the waste, the
crime, the disease, and the corruption which the Price System spawns,
why do you stick with it?
