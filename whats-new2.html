<h1>What's new on the Technocracy Web Pages</h1>

<P>
As of the 25th of October, 1997 these web pages were moved to a new
server with the domain ``www.technocracy.org''.  Therefore the
<a href="whats-new.html">old `what's new' page</a> (covering Sept
1996 to Oct 1997) was moved aside, and this one started.
<p>
I do not list changes to the <a href="calendar.html">events
calendar</a> here, assume it has changed since your last visit.

<dl compact>
<dt>28-May-2000
<dd>CHQ has set up their own web pages at
    <a href="http://www.technocracyinc.org">www.technocracyinc.org</a>,   
    as such, these web pages are now back to their
    <a href="unofficial.html">unofficial</a> status.
    This is just as well since I don't really have the time to
    maintain these web pages (as is apparent in the long lag between
    updates).
    <p>
    Also added a bit of history that I had to share:
    <a href="fbi.html">Technocracy, The FBI and the J. Edgar Hoover Stamp
    of Approval</a>

<dd>Continuing the conversion, now 38% done.
    Only minor content changes, most notably the

    the <a href="reading.html">Links page</a> has been (mostly) sorted
    out.

<dd>Many more corrections, but no new files.
    I am now 17% done with the conversion.  At this rate, I won't be
    done until March :-(
<dt>9-Nov-97
<dd>Continuing the work to make all the Technocracy web pages more
    consistent and more navigable.  I am 9% done *sigh*
<dt>2-Nov-97
<dd>Lots of minor changes to make navigation easier.  Several new
    pages were added to accompany the simplification of the main index
    page.  No new material at this time.
