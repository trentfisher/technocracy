<h1>Technocracy Study Course</h1>
<p>
This book contained the background information and the detailed
explanation of Technocracy.  It was originally distributed as several
pamphlets, these were later printed together into a small soft-cover
book, and finally into a hard-cover book.  The last printing was in 1947.
<p>
While there are no authorship credits
(except for the introduction in earlier editions, which was credited to
Arch Jameson), much of this book
is credited to <a href="../people/m-king-hubbert.html">M. King Hubbert</a>.
<p>
In the 70's this material was condensed and updated to produce the
booklet <a href="../ttsd/">Technocracy:  Technological Social Design</a>
