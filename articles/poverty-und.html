<P>
Ours is a land of paradoxes. While stockbrokers applaud each big
merger, workers gnaw nails over the next round of
downsizing. Surpluses pour into government coffers like seawater into
the Titanic, but belt-tightening continues apace. Realtors laud third
and fourth homebuyers as a mainstay of their market, while elsewhere
the homeless are offered bunk space in a seven million-dollar
kennel. We throw away billions of tons of food per year, yet on the
cover of <cite>U.S.A. Weekly</cite>, five-year-old pixie Michelle
Leneski smiles at us from the food bank, a dwindling haven that seems
to be drawing more and more Americans - not just derelicts, but
working families (so much for "hard work").
<P>
There are sound reasons that the current economic boom rings hollow
for many; why, in spite of the billions we throw at poverty, all it
does is create more bureaucracies and agencies. While some lay the
blame for the inequities at those third and fourth doorsteps, the
tendency for money to accumulate in the hands of those who already
have lots of it is only part of the story. There are other forces at
work that place growing numbers of Americans at economic risk, one
being the nature of money itself.
<P>
Money does not distribute plenty, it <I>limits</I>
distribution. Monetary value requires that there not be enough to go
around. If there were enough goods and services to provide a
comfortable standard of living for everyone - something we are
physically capable of achieving - monetary exchange values would be
meaningless. That's why you can't sell sunshine or salt water on the
beach. And this is why we can't buy our way out of poverty. In a
"market "economy, this applies to everything from gold watches to
antiques to - unfortunately - the necessities of life like food,
clothing, shelter, and medical care.
<P>
A second key factor is technology. With the speed at which automation
is displacing human labor, from banking to brain surgery, the economy
simply cannot create the job base required to provide adequate income
for large numbers of people. This trend, first pointed out by the
Technocrats in the 1930's, was reinforced by a U.S. Senate study in
1961, and most recently validated in Jeremy Rifkin's
<cite>The End of Work.</cite>
<P>
The third factor follows the second. In the place of vanishing
out-of-pocket purchasing power comes the magic of debt. Our financial
economy is fueled by little more than the exchange of IOU's on a grand
scale. At last estimate, according to economist Lester Thurow of MIT,
this burgeoning monster amounts to a staggering $20 trillion, combined
public and private. Our seeming prosperity is mortgaged against the
futures of our children.
<P>
For a true picture of our economy, check out how many car title loan
outfits are popping up. Keep an eye on the number of layoffs, credit
card delinquencies and bankruptcy filings. Talk to those working a
couple of jobs apiece, and others burned out from taking up the slack
for the victims of the last round of downsizing. Look at the retail
outlets. Stores do not let out goods on the no-payments-for-a-year
plan if things are booming. And look at your own budgets and how those
costs, latent and blatant, keep nibbling away at the take-home.
<P>
Our debt-stuctured financial economy is, in truth, a house of sticks
built of little more than sheer confidence, in which those whom it
favors blithely fiddle away until the Big Bad Wolf - the erosion of
that confidence - comes huffing and puffing. Then the house shivers
and shudders to its foundation, and millions follow little Michelle
into the lines at the food bank.
<P>
Our physical economy is quite a different story. As long our true
wealth - our people, our technology, and our natural resources -
remains intact, there are no barriers to eradicating the vast majority
of our social problems. More importantly, a failure of our physical
economy - which could take place through waste, inefficiency, and
environmental irresponsibility - will mean there will be no food banks
at all.
<P>
We suffer from a poverty of understanding, not just of the plight of
those leading lives of quiet desperation, but of the forces that shape
our society. If we truly desire economic security for all Americans,
more than a simple redistribution of wealth we need a
<I>redefining</I> of wealth. We can't build, deliver, and sustain a
high standard of living on lottery winners, box office smashes,
instant collectibles, and runaway speculation.
<P>
Ours is, after all, a winners/losers economy. But when the losers are
young children and productive working Americans whose skills, in our
skewed system of priorities, are valued less than those of Hollywood
idols and corporate athletes, something is dreadfully wrong.
<P>
We've come a long way. Not too many years ago, little Michelle Leneski
would have been spirited off to a sweat shop for her daily dose of
gruel. Now we've shipped that bit of inhumanity to foreign lands -
sort of like shuffling those embarrassing homeless from town to
town. But there's no guarantee that we won't see those days
again. Despite the bright glow of economic euphoria sweeping the
nation, there are dark indications that it's already happening. You
just have to know where, and care enough, to look.
