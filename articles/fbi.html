<h1>Technocracy, The FBI and the J. Edgar Hoover Stamp of Approval</h1>

Several years ago John Taube contacted the FBI, requesting, via the
Freedom of Information Act, their files on Technocracy.  He got a 40
page packet, which he brought with him to the Annual Labour Day event
in Aldergrove, B.C.
<p>
The first page contained a letter, dated January 1933, from an FBI
agent to the director of the FBI, about Howard Scott and the
just-started Technocracy movement.  At the bottom of the page was a
handwritten note:
<img src="fbi-hoover.jpg" alt="[image of Hoover's note]">
<p>
This was the best find in the whole 40 page packet.  J. Edgar Hoover,
himself, was requesting more information about Howard Scott.
I like to call this the ``J. Edgar Hoover Stamp of Approval.''
<p>
John Taube was told that there are 12,000 pages on Technocracy in the
FBI Washington office and 2,000 pages in the N.Y office.
