<hr>
<P>
Technocracy's survey of the economic situation in America, and in the
world, leads to the assumption of an imminent and progressive social
instability under price system operation, with corresponding social
disorder, that will threaten large portions of the people with decreasing
purchasing power and consequently, increasing hardship and deprivation.
<P>
Technocracy believes that in order to avoid the consequences of such
a debacle it is imperative to organize a disciplined body which will
resist the forces of disruption and insure the free flow of food and
other necessities to the population at large during the time of crisis
and afterward in the period of readjustment.
<P>
Technocracy believes that once the present order has demonstrated
its operational incapacity it will be the function of its engineers
and technologists to put into operation a permanent productive
and distributive system which will harness the energy resources
of the country for the mutual benefit of the entire population on a
continent-wide basis. The term ``technologists'' is used in the broadest
sense and includes, as well as scientists and engineers, educators and
experts in such other departments of human activity as are functionally
necessary for the operation of the social mechanism.
<P>
Technocracy believes that the free and independent spirit of the American
people will not be satisfied with the irrational assumptions of Communism,
or with the hollow mockery of Fascism, and that a large measure of anarchy
and disorder may be avoided by adherence to a program consistent with
American tradition. Technocracy is unconditionally opposed to and will
struggle against such subversive and revolutionary systems and any other
attempts to place this country under a dictatorship in whatever guise.
<P>
Technocracy stands ready with a plan to salvage American civilization,
if and when democracy as now functioning can no longer cope with the
inherent disruptive forces.
<P>
Technocracy believes that the substitution of technologists in place
of politicians and profiteers will be demanded by the people, sick
unto death of the insecurity and deprivation that are the inevitable
concomitants of the present ways of doing business-that the substitution
of scientific national management for the present muddling, wasteful
and ineffectual political and economic set-up represents the simple and
natural progression of the American genius.
<P>
Technocracy is not misled by emotional optimism created by temporary
palliatives. Its findings prove why no ``new deal,'' but an entirely ``new
game,'' based upon an accurate ``balanced load'' method of social control
is the only solution for the problems facing this continent.
<P>
The American nation was founded on the assumption that every man has
a right to ``life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.'' Technocracy
amplifies this original intention. Today political liberty does not
suffice. Possessing, as this continental area does, sufficient personnel
and equipment to guarantee equality of income and security to all,
Technocracy is being designed to perpetuate against all aggressors those
``inalienable rights'' promised the American people by the founding fathers
and endemic to this continent.
