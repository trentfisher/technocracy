My name is M. King Hubbert. I am a Research Geophysicist with the
U.S. Geological Survey, but I wish to make it clear that I am
testifying as an individual and I am not representing the views of the
Geological Survey or of the Administration. My scientific education
was received during the 1920's from the University of Chicago from
which I have received the degrees B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. jointly in
geology and physics with a minor in mathematics. One half of my
professional career, beginning in 1926, has been in both operations
and research with respect to the exploration and production of
petroleum. The second half has been divided about equally between
university teaching in geology, geophysics, and mineral and energy
resources, and work with the Illinois and U.S. Geological Surveys. In
the petroleum industry my work included geological and pioneer seismic
explorations in Texas, New Mexico, and Oklahoma during 1926-1928 for
the Amerada Petroleum Corporation, and in petroleum exploration and
production research during l943-1963 for Shell Oil Company and Shell
Development Company in Houston, Texas.  Also, for about a decade of
this latter period I was an Associate Director for Exploration and
Production Research for Shell during which I helped to organize and
staff a major research laboratory for petroleum exploration and
production.
<p>
My university teaching comprised a decade during the 1930's in geology
and geophysics at Columbia University; Professor of Geology and
Geophysics (part time) from 1962-1968 at Stanford University; a
Regents' Professorship during the Spring Quarter, 1973, at the
University of California, Berkeley; and numerous shorter lectureships
at various universities, including California Institute of Technology,
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Scripps Institution of
Oceanography, and the University of California, Los Angeles.
<p>
My scientific and professional affiliations include membership in the
National Academy of Sciences (elected in 1955); American Academy of
Arts and Sciences (1956); Geological Society of America (former
President; Day medal for geophysics; Penrose Medal for general
geology); American Geophysical Union; American Association of
Petroleum Geologists (Associate Editor; Honorary membership) Society
of Exploration Geophysicists (former Editor; Honorary membership)
American Institute of Mining, Metallurgical and Petroleum Engineers
(Lucas Medal for petroleum engineering): and Canadian Society of
Petroleum Geologists (Honorary membership).
<p>
Of particular pertinence to the present hearings on the rate of
industrial growth has been a continuing study, begun in 1926, of
mineral and energy resources and their significance in the evolution
of the world's present technological civilization. Of the more than a
dozen published papers resulting from this study, the following bear
directly upon some of the concerns of the present hearings:

      Commerce, Springfield, Virginia 22151.
</ul>
<p>
It is my understanding that the present hearings pertain primarily to
the bill H.R. 11343, ``A bill to provide for the establishment of a
comprehensive energy conservation program in order to regulate the
national rate of growth of energy use, to establish a Council on
Energy Policy, and for other purposes.'' In Sec. 7(a) of this bill it
is stipulated that one of the duties of such a Council shall be ``to
develop and transmit to the President and to the Congress ... a
comprehensive report setting forth the proposed legislation it deems
necessary to achieve a <em>maximum rate of growth in energy
consumption of 2 per centum per year''</em> [Italics added].
<p>
Instead of discussing the merits or demerits of this proposed
legislation, I think that it may be more helpful if I discuss some of
the aspects of growth in general in an effort to see the bearing which
these relationships may have upon our evolving social system.
<p>
The earth and its biological inhabitants comprise an evolving system
in which various of its components change in magnitude with time. To
describe these changes we may use the term ``growth'' in a generic sense
as being synonymous with change. Thus a given quantity may be said to
exhibit positive growth if its magnitude increases with time, negative
growth if it decreases with time, and zero growth if it remains
constant.
<p>
Two terms applicable to an evolving system are of fundamental
importance. These are <dfn>steady</dfn> (or <dfn>stationary</dfn>)
<dfn>state</dfn> and <dfn>transient state</dfn>. A system is said to
be in a steady state when its various components either do not change
with time, or else vary cyclically with the repetitive cycles not
changing with time. A system in a transient state is one whose various
components are undergoing noncyclical changes in magnitude, either of
increase or decrease.
<p>
In distinguishing these two states the time scale needs also to be
taken into account. Actually, an ideal steady state on the earth is
impossible. For example, a pendulum clock driven by a weight or a
spring is an almost perfect example of a cyclical steady state, with
one exception: the weight falls or the spring unwinds. This latter
characteristic is a transient phenomenon. Similarly on the earth many
quantities vary cyclically on a diurnal or annual scale and yet change
very slowly over periods of thousands of years. However, even these
quantities which approximate a steady state over intermediate periods
of time become transient phenomena on a longer time scale. On a time
scale of the solar system even the sun's radiation is a transient
phenomenon due to the fact that the sun is slowly exhausting the
supply of hydrogen upon which its radiation of energy depends.
<p>
<img src="hub-gro01.gif" width="324" height="243" align="left" >
<p>
The growth phenomena with which we are at present concerned are almost
exclusively of the transient kind. Three types of transient growth are
illustrated in Figure 1. This figure is drawn with a time base
extending from the year 1800 to beyond 2100 during which some quantity
is assumed to grow in one or the other of the three modes shown. The
first of these growth modes, shown by Curve I is uniform exponential
growth. In this curve the magnitude of the growing quantity is assumed
to double every 20 years. The equation for this type of growth is
<p align=center>
<var>Q = Q<sub>O</sub> e<sup>at</sup></var>     (1)
<p>
where <var>Q<sub>0</sub></var> is the magnitude of the quantity at
initial or zero time, <var>Q</var> its magnitude at time <var>t</var>,
<var>a</var> the fraction by which the quantity increases per unit
time, and <var>e</var>=2.718 is the base of natural logarithms.
<p>
This equation can also be expressed in terms of successive doublings by
<p align=center>
<var>Q = Q<sub>0</sub>2<sup>t/T</sup> = Q<sub>0</sub>2<sup>n</sup></var>  (2)
<p>
where <var>T</var> is the doubling period and <var>n=t/T</var> is the
number of times the quantity has doubled in the time <var>t</var>.
The relation between the doubling period <var>T</var> and the growth
rate <var>a</var> is obtained from equation (1) by transposing
<var>Q<sub>0</sub></var> to the left side and noting that for
<var>Q=2Q<sub>0</sub></var>
<p align=center>
<var>Q/Q<sub>0</sub> = 2 = e<sup>aT</sup></var> (3)
<p>
Then taking the natural logarithm of both sides, we obtain 
<p align=center>
<var>ln2=aT</var>
<p>
whereby,
<p align=center>
<var>a = ln2/T = 0.693/T</var> (4)
<p>
or conversely,
<p align=center>
<var>T=0.693/a</var> (5)
<p>
According to equation 4 a quantity which grows at such a rate as to
double every 20 years would have a growth rate a per year of 0.0346,
or 3.46 percent. By equation 5, a quantity which increases at a rate
of 0.0693, or 6.93 percent per year would double every 10 years.
<p>
Another fundamental property of uniform exponential growth is the
following. If the logarithm of the quantity is plotted graphically as
a function of time, or if the quantity is plotted on semilogarithmic
paper, the resulting graph will be a straight line whose slope is
proportional to the growth rate. Conversely, a straight-line graph of
the growth of a quantity, when plotted on semilogarithmic paper,
indicates a uniform exponential growth.
<p>
A second type of growth is that shown in Curve II of Figure 1. Here
the growing quantity increases exponentially for a while during its
initial stage, after which the growth rate starts to slow down until
the magnitude of the quantity finally levels off to some fixed maximum
quantity. After this the growth rate becomes zero, and the quantity
attains a steady state. Examples of this kind of growth are afforded
by biological populations and by the development of water power in a
given region. The population of any biologic species, if initially
stationary, will respond to changed conditions in a manner indicated
by Curve II, or conversely by its negative analog. That is, the
population in response to a disturbance will either increase
exponentially and then level off to a stable maximum, or else decrease
negative-exponentially and finally stabilize at a lower level, or
perish.
<p>
The development of water power in a given region behaves in a similar
manner. The curve of installed capacity finally levels off and
stabilizes at a maximum compatible with the potential water power
afforded by the streams of the region.
<p>
A third type of transient growth is that represented by Curve III in
Figure 1. Here, the quantity grows exponentially for a while. Then the
growth rate diminishes until the quantity reaches one or more maxima,
and then undergoes a negative-exponential decline back to zero. This
is the type of growth curve that must be followed in the exploitation
of any exhaustible resource such as coal or oil, or deposits of
metallic ores.

<h2>Transition From Steady State To Transient State Due To Fossil Fuels</h2>
<p>
By about 2 million years ago biological evolution had advanced to
where the ancestors of the present human species had begun to walk
upright and to use crude stone tools. At that stage this species must
have existed as a member of an ecological complex and competed with
the other members of the complex for a share of the local solar energy
essential for its existence. The energy utilizable was almost
exclusively the food supply derived by the biological system from
solar energy by the mechanism of photosynthesis. During the subsequent
million or more years the human species progressively devised means of
capturing an ever larger supply of the available energy. This resulted
in a slow change in the ecological relations and to an increase in
density and geographical spread of the human population, but the
energy per capita changed very little. In view of the slowness with
which these developments must have occurred, the whole ecological
system of which the human species was a member can only be regarded as
comprising a slowly changing ecological steady state.
<p>
Although the pace quickened about 8,000 to 10,000 years ago with the
domestication of plants and animals, a rapidly changing transient
state of evolution was not possible until the large supplies of energy
stored in the fossil fuels began to be utilized -when the mining of
coal as a continuous enterprise was begun near Newcastle in northeast
England about 9 centuries ago. This was followed as recently as 1857
in Romania and in 1859 in the United States by the exploitation of the
second major source of fossil-fuel energy, petroleum.
<p>
<img src="hub-gro02.gif" width="257" height="221" align="left">
<p>
In the case of coal mining, although scattered statistics are
available during the earlier centuries, continuous annual statistics
of world production are difficult to assemble earlier than 1860. In
Figure 2 is plotted on an arithmetic scale the annual production of
coal and lignite from 1860 to 1965, and the approximate rate back to
1800. In Figure 3 the same data are plotted on a semilogarithmic
scale. What is most obvious from Figure 2 is the large contrast
between the magnitudes of the rate of coal production following the
year 1800, and that which must have prevailed during the preceding 7
centuries. From earlier statistics it can be estimated that the
cumulative coal production during the eight hundred years before 1860
amounted altogether to only about 7 billion metric tons, whereas 133
billion metric tons, or 19 times as much coal, was mined during the
110-year period from 1860 to 1970. Also during the entire 9 centuries
about 140 billion tons were mined; of this, somewhat more than half
was produced during the 34-year period from 1940 to 1970.
<p>
<img src="hub-gro03.gif" width="316" height="229" align="right">
<p>
In the semilogarithmic plotting of Figure 3, three separate periods of
exponential growth in coal mining are shown. The first and principal
phase extends from 1860 to World War I. During this period production
increased at a rate of about 4.4 percent per year with a doubling
period of 16 years. During the second period from World War I to World
War II the growth rate dropped only 0.75 percent per year. Then
following World War II, an intermediate rate of 3.6 percent per year
ensued.
<p>
The corresponding growth of the world production of crude oil is shown
in Figures 4 and 5. As the semilogarithmic graph of Figure 5 shows,
during the first 20 years crude-oil production increased at a higher
rate than later. After about 1880 the annual production settled down
to a nearly uniform exponential growth, averaging about 6.94 percent
per year with a doubling period of 10.0 years. By 1970 the cumulative
production amounted to 233 &times; 10<sup>9</sup> barrels. Of this, one half
has been produced since 1960.

<p>
Coal production in the United States is shown on a semilogarithmic
graph in Figure 6. In this case, the uniform exponential-growth phase
persist from 1850 to 1907, with an average growth rate of 6.6 percent
per year and a doubling period of 10.5 years. The corresponding growth
in the annual production of crude oil in the United States, exclusive
of Alaska, is shown in Figure 7. As in the case of world production,
the growth rate initially was somewhat higher than that later. After
1875 annual production increased at a uniform exponential rate of 8.3
percent per year with a doubling period of 8.4 years until the
beginning of the Depression following 1929.
<p>
<img src="hub-gro08.gif" width="264" height="192" align="left">
<p>
The relation between the curve of the complete cycle of exploitation
(similar to Curve III in Figure I) and the cumulative production is
shown in Figure 8. Mathematically, when the production rate as a
function of time is plotted arithmetically, the area beneath the curve
becomes it graphical measure of the cumulative production. For the
complete cycle of production, the curve must begin at zero and, after
reaching one or more maxima, it must decline to zero for whatever
estimate must be made from geological or other information of the
ultimate quantity, <var>Q</var>, to be produced, the complete-cycle
curve must be drawn in such a manner that the subtended area does not
exceed that corresponding to the estimate.
<p>
Utilizing this principle, curves for the complete cycles of coal
production for the world and for the United States are shown in
Figures 9 and 10. In each ease the upper curve corresponds to an
estimate of recoverable coal made by Averitt of the U.S. Geological
Survey. For the world Averitt estimated the initial quantity of
recoverable coal assuming 50 percent recovery of coal in place,
amounts to 7.6 &times; 10<sup>12</sup> metric tons, and for the United
States 1.5 &times; 10<sup>12</sup> metric tons. These figures, however,
include coal in beds as thin as 14 inches and to depths of 3000 feet
or more. Since coal beds of such depths and thinness are not very
practical sources for mining, actual minable coal may be considerably
less than Averitt's maximum figures. This fact is indicated by the
lower curves in each of Figures 9 and 10, based upon figures about
half those by Averitt.
<p>
<img src="hub-gro09.gif" width="288" height="180">
<img src="hub-gro10.gif" width="314" height="194" >
<p>
The significant fact about the complete-cycle curves of coal
production in Figures 9 and 10 is that if only 2 or 3 more doublings
occur in the rates of production, the peak production rates will
probably occur not later than about 150 years from now. Another
significant quantity displayed by these curves is the time required to
produce the middle 80 percent of the ultimate cumulative
production. To produce the first 10 percent of the world's ultimate
amount of coal will require the 1000 year period to about the year
2000.  The last 10 percent may require another 1000 years during the
declining stage. The time required to produce the middle 80 percent
will probably not be longer than about 3 centuries extending roughly
from the year 2000 to 2300. If the peak rate should be higher, or the
quantity to be produced less than are shown in Figure 9, this period
could be shortened to possibly 2 centuries or less.
<p>
<img src="hub-gro11.gif" width="360" height="228">
<img src="hub-gro12.gif" width="277" height="201">
<p>
Complete cycles for crude-oil production in the United States and in
the world, respectively, are shown in Figures 11 and 12. For the
United States, exclusive of Alaska, several lines of evidence reviewed
in detail in the papers cited heretofore indicate that the ultimate
quantity, <var>Q</var>, of crude oil to be produced will be about 170
billion barrels. The complete-cycle curve is based on that figure. For
the world, the two curves shown in Figure 12 are based on a low
estimate of 1350 and a high estimate of 2100 billion barrels.
<p>
What is most strikingly shown by these complete-cycle curves is the
brevity of the period during which petroleum can serve as a major
source of energy. The peak in the production rate for the United
States has already occurred three years ago in 1970. The peak in the
production rate for the world based upon the high estimate of 2100
billion barrels, will occur about the year 2000. For the United
States, the time required to produce the middle 80 percent of the 170
billion barrels will be approximately the 67-year period from about
1932-1999. For the world, the period required to produce the middle 80
percent of the estimated 2100 billion barrels will be about 64 years
from 1968 to 2032.  Hence, a child born in the mid-1930s if he lives a
normal life expectancy, will see the United States consume most of its
oil during his lifetime. Similarly, a child born within the last 5
years will see the world consume most of its oil during his lifetime.
<p>
<img src="hub-gro13.gif" width="345" height="171" align="left">
<p>
A better appreciation of the epoch of the fossil fuels in human
history can be obtained if the complete production cycle for all the
fossil fuels combined -- coal, oil, natural gas, tar sands, and oil
shales--is plotted on a time span of human history extending from 5000
years in the past to 5000 years in the future, a period well within
the prospective span of human history. Such a plotting is shown in
Figure 13. This Washington Monument-like spike, with a middle
80-percent span of about three centuries, represents the entire
epoch. On such a time scale, it is seen that the epoch of the fossil
fuel can be but an ephemeral and transitory event-an event,
nonetheless, that has exercised the most drastic influence so far
experienced by the human species during Its entire biological
existence.

<h2>Other Sources of Energy</h2>
<p>
It is not the object of the present discussion to review the world's
energy resources. Therefore, let us state summarily that of the other
sources of energy of a magnitude suitable for large-scale industrial
uses, water power, tidal power, and geothermal power are very useful
in special cases but do not have a sufficient magnitude to supplant
the fossil fuels. Nuclear power based on fission is potentially larger
than the fossil fuels, but it also represents the most hazardous
industrial operation in terms of potential catastrophic effects that
has ever been undertaken in human history.
<p>
For a source of energy of even larger magnitude and without the
hazardous characteristics of nuclear power, we are left with solar
radiation. In magnitude, the solar radiation reaching the earth's
surface amounts to about 120,000 &times; 10<sup>12</sup> watts, which
is equivalent, thermally, to the energy inputs to 40 million
1000-megawatt power plants. Suffice it to say that only now has
serious technological attention begun to be directed to this potential
source of industrial power. However, utilizing principally technology
already in existence there is promise that eventually solar energy
alone could easily supply all of the power requirements for the
world's human population.

<h2>Constraints on Growth</h2>
<p>
<img src="hub-gro14.gif" width="313" height="242" align="right">
<p>
Returning now to the problem of sustained growth, it would appear that
with an adequate development of solar power it should be possible to
continue the rates of growth of the last century for a considerable
time into the future. However, with regard to this optimistic view
attention needs to be directed to other constraints than the magnitude
of the energy supply. These constraints may be broadly classified as
being ecological in nature. For more than a century it has been known
in biology that if any biological species from microbes to elephants
is given a favorable environment, its population will begin to
increase at an exponential rate. However, it was also soon established
that such a growth rate cannot long continue before retarding
influences set in. These are commonly of the nature of crowding,
pollution, food supply, and in an open system by adjustments with
respect to other members of the ecological complex.
<p>
In our earlier review of the rates of production of the fossil fuels
it was observed that for close to a century in each case the
production increased exponentially with doubling periods within the
range of 8 to 16 years. The same type of growth rates are
characteristic of most other industrial components. Figure 14 is a
graph showing the exponential growth of the world electric generating
capacity. The solid part of the curve since 1955 shows a growth rate
of 8.0 percent per year with a doubling period of 8.7 years. The
dashed part of the curve shows approximately the growth since 1900. In
the United States during the last several decades electric power
capacity has been doubling about every 10 years. The world population
of automobiles and also passenger miles of scheduled air flights are
each also doubling about every 10 years.
<p>
<img src="hub-gro15.gif" width="334" height="234" align="left">
<p>
In Figure 15 a graph is shown of the growth of the world's human
population from the year 1000 A.D. to the present, and an approximate
projection to the year 2000. This is important in that it shows the
ecological disturbance of the human population produced by the
development of technology based upon the fossil fuels, the concomitant
developments in biological and medical science, and expansion into the
sparsely settled areas of the newly discovered geographical
territories. Note the very slow rate of growth in the human population
during the 500 year period from the year 1000 A.D. to 1500, and then
the accelerated growth that has occurred subsequently. Were it
possible to plot this curve backward in time for a million years, the
curve would be barely above zero for that entire period. The flare up
that has occurred since the year 15M is a unique event in human
biological history.
<p>
It is also informative to contrast the present growth rate of the
human population with the average that must have prevailed during the
past. The present world population is about 3.9 billion which is
increasing at a rate of about 2 percent per year, with a doubling
period of about 35 years. What could have been the minimum average
doubling period during the last million years? This minimum would
occur if we make a wholly unrealistic assumption, namely that the
population a million years ago was the biological minimum of 2. How
many doublings of this original couple would be required to reach the
world's present population of 3.9 billion? Slightly less than
31. Hence, the maximum number of times the population could have
doubled during the last million years would have been 31. The minimum
value of the average period of doubling must accordingly have been
1,000,000/31, or 32,000 years.
<p>
To be sure the population need not have grown smoothly. Fluctuations
no doubt must have occurred due to plagues, climatic changes, and
wars, but there is no gainsaying the conclusion that the rate of
growth until recently must have been so extremely slow that we may
regard the human population during most of its history as
approximating an ecological steady state.
<p>
<img src="hub-gro16.gif" width="366" height="214" align="left" >
<p>
The same kind of reasoning may be applied to the other components of
any ecological system. It is known from geological evidence that
organic species commonly persist for millions of years.  Consequently,
when we compute a maximum average growth rate between two finite
levels of population at a time interval of a million years, we arrive
at the same conclusion, namely that the normal state &#173; that is
the state that persists most of the time &#173; is one of an
approximate steady state. The abnormal state of an ecological system
is a rapidly changing transient or disturbed state. Figure 16
illustrates the behavior of the populations of three separate species
of an ecological complex during a transient disturbance between two
steady states. In such a disturbance all populations are effected,
some favorably, some unfavorably.
<p>
To obtain an idea of how long a disturbed or transient state can
persist, a fundamental question that may be asked is: About how many
doublings of any biological or industrial component can the earth
itself tolerate? A clue to this may be obtained if we consider the
problem of the grains of wheat and the chessboard. According to an
ancient story from India, a king wished to reward one of his subjects
for some meritorious deed. The man replied that his needs were few and
he would be satisfied to receive a bit of wheat. If 1 grain were
placed on the first square of a chessboard, 2 on the second, 4 on the
third, and the number of grains were doubled for each successive
square, he would be content to receive this amount of grain. The king
ordered the board to be brought in and the wheat counted out. To his
consternation he found that there was not enough wheat in the
kingdom. Recently I obtained some wheat, measured a small volume,
counted the grains, and did some arithmetic to find out how much wheat
really was involved. The results were the following: On the nth square
of the board the number of grains would be
2<sup>n-1</sup>; for the 64th and last square the
number of grains would be 2<sup>63</sup>; and for the
whole board the total number of grains would be twice that for the
last square or 2<sup>64</sup> grains. This amount of
wheat, it turned out, would be 2000 times the world's present annual
wheat crop.
<p>
While this may appear to be a trivial problem, its implications are
actually profound. The Earth itself cannot tolerate the doubling of 1
grain of wheat 64 times.
<p>
The same principles and the same kinds of constraints apply when we
are dealing with successive doublings of any other biological or
industrial component. Even if there were no shortages of energy or of
materials the earth will not tolerate more than a few tens of
doublings. For example, as was remarked earlier, the world population
of automobiles is doubling about every 10 years. Suppose we substitute
automobiles for wheat grains in the chessboard problem. Take one
American-size automobile and double it 64 times. Then stack the
resultant number of cars uniformly over all the land areas of the
earth. How deep a layer would be formed? One thousand miles deep.

<h2>Cultural Aspects of the Growth Problem</h2>
<p>
Without further elaboration, It is demonstrable that the exponential
phase of the industrial growth which has dominated human activities
during the last couple of centuries is drawing to a close. Some
biological and industrial components must follow paths such as Curve
II in Figure 1 and level off to a steady state; others must follow
Curve III and decline ultimately to zero. But it is physically and
biologically impossible for any material or energy component to follow
the exponential growth phase of Curve I for more than a few tens of
doublings, and most of those possible doublings have occurred already.
<p>
Yet, during the last two centuries of unbroken industrial growth we
have evolved what amounts to an exponential-growth culture. Our
institutions, our legal system, our financial system, and our most
cherished folkways and beliefs are all based upon the premise of
continuing growth. Since physical and biological constraints make it
impossible to continue such rates of growth indefinitely, it is
inevitable that with the slowing down in the rates of physical growth
cultural adjustments must be made.
<p>
One example of such a cultural difficulty is afforded by the
fundamental difference between the properties of money and those of
matter and energy upon which the operation of the physical world
depends.  Money, being a system of accounting, is, in effect, paper
and so is not constrained by the laws within which material and energy
systems must operate. In fact money grows exponentially by the rule of
compound interest. If <var>M<sub>0</sub></var> be a national
monetary stock at an initial time, and <var>i</var>the
mean value of the interest rate, then at a later time
<var>t</var> the sum of money
<var>M<sub>o</sub></var> will have grown exponentially to a
larger sum <var>M</var> given by the equation

<p align=center>
<var>M=M<sub>0</sub>e<sup>it</sup></var>.  (6)
<p>
Next consider the rate of physical production. Let <var>Q</var> be the
generalized output of the industrial system at the initial time, and
<var>a</var> be the rate of industrial growth. The industrial
production at time <var>t</var> will then be given by

<p align=center>
<var>Q=Q<sub>0</sub>e<sup>at</sup></var>.  (7)
<p>
At any given time the ratio of a sum of money to what the money will
buy is a generalized price level, <var>P</var>. Hence

<p align=center>
<var>P=M/Q</var>  (8)
<p>
which, when substituted into equations 6 and 7, gives 
<p align=center>
<var>P=M/Q</var>
<var>= M<sub>0</sub>e<sup>it</sup> /
Q<sub>0</sub>e<sup>at</sup> = (M<sub>0</sub>/Q<sub>0</sub>) e<sup>(a-i)t</sup>
</var>
<p>
However, <var>M<sub>0</sub>/Q<sub>0</sub> = P<sub>0</sub></var>, the price
level at the initial time. Therefore,
<p align=center>
<var>P = P<sub>0</sub>e<sup>(a-i)t</sup></var>
<p>
which states that the generalized price level should increase
exponentially at a rate equal to the difference between the rate of
growth of money and that of industrial production. In particular, if
the industrial growth rate <var>a</var> and the average interest rate
<var>i</var> have the same values, then the ratio of money to what
money will buy will remain constant and a stable price level should
prevail. Suppose, however, that for physical reasons the industrial
growth rate <var>a</var> declines but the interest rate <var>i</var>
holds steady. We should then have a situation where <var>i</var> is
greater than <var>a</var> with the corresponding price
inflation at the rate <var>(i-a)</var>.  Finally, consider a physical
growth rate <var>a</var>=0, with the interest rate <var>i</var>
greater than zero.  In this case, the rate
of price inflation should be the same as the average interest
rate. Conversely, if prices are to remain stable at reduced rates of
industrial growth this would require that the average interest rate
should be reduced by the same amount. Finally, the maintenance of a
constant price level in a nongrowing industrial system implies either
an interest rate of zero or continuous inflation.
<p>
As a check on the validity of these deductions, consider the curves of
U.S. energy and pig-iron production shown in Figures 17 and
18. Because energy is a common factor in all industrial operation and
pig-iron production one of the basic components of heavy industry, the
growth in the production of energy and pig Iron is a very good
indicator of the total industrial production.

<p>
Figure 17 Is a graph plotted on a semilogarithmic scale of the
production of energy from coal, oil, gas, and water power and a small
amount of nuclear power from 1850 to 1969. From 1850 to 1907 the
production of energy increased exponentially at a rate of 6.91 percent
per year, with a doubling period of 10.0 years. Then during the
three-year period from 1907 to 1910, the growth rate dropped abruptly
to a mean rate of 1.77 percent per year and the doubling period
increased to 39 years.
<p>
Figure 17 is a corresponding plot of U.S. pig-iron production. The
pig-iron curve resembles that of energy so closely 'that the two
curves can hardly be told from one another. Pig-iron production also
grew exponentially at a rate close to 7 percent per year until about
1910, when it too broke abruptly to a lower rate of less than 2
percent per year. This abrupt break at about 1910 represents a major
event in the industrial history of the United States, yet we have
barely been aware that it happened.
<p>
In parallel with this industrial growth during most of the 19th
century and continuing until 1929, the mean monetary interest rate was
also about 7 percent per year. Therefore until 1910 the price level,
except for temporary disturbances, should have remained comparatively
stable. Following 1910, when the physical growth rate dropped to about
2 percent per year, whereas the interest rate remained at about 7
percent, a price inflation at a rate of about 5 percent per year
should have begun. Despite fluctuations, the interest rate has
remained consistently higher than the physical growth rate from 1910
to the present, which implies that we should have had an almost
continuous price inflation for the last 64 years.
<p>

<p>
A graphical illustration of the relations between the monetary growth,
physical growth, and price inflation is shown In Figure 19. The upper
straight line represents the exponential growth of money at the
interest rate <var>i</var>; the lower curve the physical growth at the
lower rate <var>a</var>. The ratio of <var>M</var> to <var>Q</var> at
any given time is proportional to the distance between those two
curves. If the curves are parallel, the spacing is constant and a
stable price level will prevail. If the curves are divergent to the
right, the price level will increase at the rate <var>(i-a)</var>.
<p>
These curves depict the approximate relation between the monetary
growth rate and the physical growth rate that has prevailed in the
United States since 1910.
<p>
Finally, as confirmatory evidence, there is shown in Figure 20 a graph
of the consumer price index as computed for each year from 1800 to
1971 by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The three principal
distortions coincide with the War of 1812, the Civil War, and World
War I. Disregarding these, and drawing a smooth curve under the bases
of each gives a very informative result. For the period from 1800 to
1910 the consumer price level remained remarkably stable. Beginning
about 1910, at the time of the abrupt drop in the rate of industrial
growth, prices began to inflate and they have continued to do so to
the present time.

<h2>Time Perspective of Industrial and Cultural Evolution</h2>
<p>
The foregoing example has been discussed in detail because it serves
as a case history of the type of cultural difficulties which may be
anticipated during the transition period from a phase of exponential
growth to a stable state. Since the tenets of our exponential-growth
culture (such as a nonzero interest rate) are incompatible with a
state of nongrowth, it is understandable that extraordinary efforts
will be made to avoid a cessation of growth. Inexorable, however,
physical and biological constraints must eventually prevail and
appropriate cultural adjustments will have to be made.
<p>Mr. UDALL. Thank you, sir.
<p>
We will try to take about 3 minutes for each member who wants to ask
questions.
<p>
I have two quick ones. First is a comment, or it may be a question.
<p>
It is interesting to me that you distinguished physical scientists
have arrived at the same conclusion, sort of, that Dr. Heilbroner, an
economist, has arrived at. And that is that this inflation that we are
all so concerned about now may not necessarily be mismanagement of the
economy or some temporary problems necessarily, but maybe built into
this whole problem of exponential growth in terms of the population
and use of resources, and so on.
<p>
Is that what you are saying?
<p>
Dr. HUBBERT. It has been going on, the record is unequivocal, since
1910, disregarding the disturbance of World War I.
<p>
Mr. UDALL. My second question is, as one has been right when others
were wrong in terms of the availability of petroleum, I understand
from your statement here and other information that we peaked in
U.S. oil production about 3 or 4 years ago, 1970 or 1971.
<p>
Dr. HUBBERT. 1970.
<p>
Mr. UDALL. Do you foresee, even with the best scenario, the most
optimistic luck offshore, turning to oil shale, these kinds of things,
do you think we will ever again exceed the rate of production,
domestic production of oil from all sources that we had in 1970?
<p>
Dr. HUBBERT. I doubt it. The argument is made, wait until Alaska comes
on stream, and all that. More than likely that will merely slow down
the rate of decline. The amounts of oil that are postulated to be
discovered off the Atlantic seaboard I am very, very dubious
about. And so my best guess is, on the basis of the information at
hand, that the peak of 1970 is the all time peak. And the other things
that we would do would be merely to slowdown the rate of decline
rather than to reverse it. I won't say it is impossible to reverse it,
but I am very dubious that we can.
<p>
Mr. UDALL. The likelihood is that we will not.
<p>
Dr. HUBBERT. My guess is that it will not happen.
<p>
Mr. UDALL. I notice the figures that oil production in the United
States last year was less than it was the year before, and that this
trend, if it continues, would mean that by the time we get to the full
2 million barrels a day from Alaska, we will have lost 2 million in
production from other U.S. sources.
<p>
Dr. HUBBERT. That is my best guess on the matter.
<p>
Mr. UDALL. Mr. Martin?
<p>
Mr. MARTIN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
<p>
Mr. Hubbert, this is a very important fundamental analysis of what has
happened to cause changes in our growth rate.
<p>
I notice that one conclusion that you show in many of these graphs is
the change in the rate of growth in production of both energy and
minerals in about 1910. Then it seems to me you are saying as a
necessary consequence of that is the increased rise in the cost of
living and inflation since about 1910 also.
<p>
Is that reading you correctly?
<p>
Dr. HUBBERT. I am principally saying -- in the first place that the
break of 1910 is, I think, a major event in American history, and we
didn't even know it happened. We have been coasting along under the
illusion that we had far more growth since 1910 than we had actually
had. If you want to go back to the decade of the 1920's, that was
regarded during the time as a period of a great boom. Well, actually
industrially, although the industrial production in 1929 was the
highest up until that date, it was still about 30 percent less than
where it would have been if that break hadn't occurred in 1910.
<p>
So that the decade of the 1920's was a boom period on paper, not
industrially. Industrially it was a slowing down period.
<p>
Mr. MARTIN. When you compare it on the logarithmic scale and show
these different slopes?
<p>
Dr. HUBBERT. Yes, Sir.
<p>
Mr. MARTIN. I have no further questions, Mr. Chairman.
<p>
Mr. UDALL. Mr. Roncalio?
<p>
Mr. RONCALIO. I have deeply enjoyed this. I don't think I have grasped it all.
<p>
Will you state again, what happened in 1910?
<p>
Dr. HUBBERT. The growth of total energy, industrial energy of the
United States, from coal, oil, gas, waterpower, plotted on
semilogarithmic paper will plot a straight line if you have
uniform exponential growth. That straight line continued until the
period of about a 3-year interval, 1907 to 1910, and then it broke
away to a lower line of less than 2 percent a year. The growth rate up
until that time was about 7 percent, a year.
<p>
I have another curve showing the same thing in pig iron. Pig iron is
the foundation of heavy industry in the United States other than
energy. The same growth rate approximately occurred to 1910, and the
same break occurred to less than 2 percent.
<p>
Mr. RONCALIO. That is on your figure 1?
<p>
Dr. HUBBERT. No, it is toward the end over there.
<p>
Mr. RONCALIO. Figure 17.
<p>
Dr. HUBBERT. Yes.
<p>
Mr. RONCALIO. Thank you very much. I would like to hear more some day.
<p>
Mr. UDALL. I think this has been a very useful hearing this morning. I
thank you all who participated.
<p>
I thank you particularly, Dr. Hubbert.
<p>
The subcommittee will stand adjourned until Thursday at the regular time.
<p>
[Whereupon, at 12:07 p.m., the subcommittee adjourned, to reconvene at
9:45 a.m., Thursday, June 6, 1974.]
