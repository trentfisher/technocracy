<P>
The late <a href="../people/m-king-hubbert.html">Dr. M. King Hubbert,</a>
a geophysicist, is well known as a world
authority on the estimation of energy resources and on the prediction of
their patterns of discovery and depletion.
<ol>
  <LI>He was probably the best known geophysicist in the world to the
      general public because of his startling prediction, first made
      publicly in 1949, that the fossil fuel era would be of very
      short duration.
  <LI>His prediction in 1956 that U.S. oil production would peak in
      about 1970 and decline thereafter was scoffed at then but his
      analysis has since proved to be remarkably accurate.
</ol>
<P>
Less well known were Hubbert's studies since 1926 on the rate of
industrial growth and of mineral and energy resources and their
significance in the evolution of the world's present technological
civilization. 3  Clark in <cite>Geophysics</cite> in February 1983
states ``In recent
years, he (Hubbert) has assaulted a target -- which he labels the culture
of money -- that is gigantic even by Hubbert standards.  His thesis is that
society is seriously handicapped because its two most  important
intellectual underpinnings, the science of matter-energy and the historic
system of finance, are incompatible.  A reasonable co-existence is possible
when both are growing at approximately the same rate.  That, Hubbert says,
has been happening since the start of the industrial revolution but it is
soon going to end because the amount the matter-energy system can grow is
limited while money's growth is not.''
<P>
``I was in New York in the 30's.  I had a box seat at the
depression,'' Hubbert says.  ``I can assure you it was a very educational
experience.  We shut the country down because of monetary reasons.  We had
manpower and abundant raw materials.  Yet we shut the country down.  We're
doing the same kind of thing now but with a different material outlook.  We
are not in the position we were in 1929-30 with regard to the future.  Then
the physical system was ready to roll. This time it's not.  We are in a
crisis in the evolution of human society.  It's unique to both human and
geologic history.  It has never happened before and it can't possibly
happen again.  You can only use oil once.  You can only use metals once.
Soon all the oil is going to be burned and all the metals mined and
scattered.''  That is obviously a scenario of catastrophe, a possibility
Hubbert concedes.  But it is not one he forecast.  The man known to many as
a pessimist is, in this case, quite hopeful.  In fact, he could be the
ultimate utopian.  We have, he says, the necessary technology.  All we have
to do is  completely overhaul our culture and find an alternative to money.
<P>
``We are not starting from zero,'' he emphasizes.  ``We have an
enormous amount of existing technical knowledge.  It's just a matter of
putting it all together.  We still have great flexibility but our
maneuverability will diminish with time.''
<P>
A non-catastrophic solution is impossible, Hubbert feels, unless
society is made stable.  This means abandoning two axioms of our culture .
. . the work ethic and the idea that growth is the normal state of affairs.
Hubbert challenges the latter mathematically and concludes the exponential
growth of the last two centuries is the opposite of the normal situation.
<P>
``It is an aberration.  For most of human history the population
doubled only once every 32,000 years.  Now it's down to 35 years.  That is
dangerous.  No biologic population can double more that a few times without
getting seriously out of bounds.  I think the world is seriously
overpopulated right now.  There can be no possible solutions to the world's
problems that do not involve stabilization of the world's
population.''
<P>
Hubbert's ideas about work are even more heretical.  Work is
becoming, he says, increasingly unimportant.  He thinks it is conceivable
that the future work week might be on the order of 10 hours.  Indeed,
because production will have to be limited by increasingly limited mineral
resources, that might be inevitable.  And that, Hubbert stresses, could be
the foundation of an earthly paradise.
<P>
``Most employment now is merely pushing paper around,'' he says.
``The actual work needed to keep a stable society running is a very small
fraction of available manpower.''
<P>
The key to making this cultural alteration is to come up with a
limitless supply of cheap energy.  Hubbert feels the answer is
obvious--solar power--and he does not feel more technological breakthroughs
are needed before it can be made universally available.  His faith is not
that of a knee-jerk trendy but that of a doubter who did much studying
before his conversion.
<P>
``Fifteen years ago I thought solar power was impractical because I
thought nuclear power was the answer.  But I spent some time on an advisory
committee on waste disposal to the Atomic Energy Commission.  After that, I
began to be very, very skeptical because of the hazards.  That's when I
began to study solar power.  I'm convinced we have the technology to handle
it right now.  We could make the transition in a matter of decades if we
begin now.''
<P>
On June 4th, 1974 Hubbert testified before Representative  Morris K.
Udall's Subcommittee on the Environment.3  In his 21 page written statement
he presented his familiar lecture on various growth curves, their
equations, curves of world and U.S. production of fossil fuels as well as
projections for the future.  He next discussed the cultural aspects of the
growth problem.  He states, ``during the last two centuries of unbroken
industrial growth we have evolved what amounts to an exponential-growth
culture.  Our institutions, our legal system, our financial system, and our
most cherished folkways and beliefs are all based upon the premise of
continuing growth,  Since physical and biological constraints make it
impossible to continue such rates of growth indefinitely, it is inevitable
that with the slowing down in the rates of physical growth cultural
adjustments must be made.
<P>
One example of such cultural difficulty is afforded by the
fundamental difference between the properties of money and those of matter
and energy upon which the operation of the physical world depends.  Money,
being a system of accounting, is, in effect, paper and so is not
constrained by the laws within which material and energy systems must
operate.  In fact money grows exponentially by the rule of compound
interest.'' He next derives the equations for the growth of the stock of
money, the rate of industrial growth and the generalized price level.  The
expression for the generalized price level states that this level ``should
increase exponentially at a rate equal to the difference between the rate
of growth of money and that of industrial production.  In particular, if
the industrial growth rate a and the average interest rate i have the same
values, then the ratio of money to what money will buy will remain constant
and a stable price level should prevail.  Suppose, however, that for
physical reasons the industrial growth rate a declines but the interest
rate i holds steady.  We should then have a situation where i is greater
than a with the corresponding price inflation at the rate (i-a).  Finally
consider a physical growth rate a=0, with the interest rate i greater than
zero.  In this case, the rate of price inflation should be the same as the
average interest rate.  Conversely, if prices are to remain stable at
reduced rates of industrial growth this would require that the average
interest rate should be reduced by the same amount.  Finally, the
maintenance of a constant price level in a non-growing industrial system
implies either an interest rate of zero or continuous inflation.
<P>
As a check on the validity of these deductions, consider the curves
of U.S. energy and pig-iron production (which he shows in Figures 17 and
18.)  Because energy is a common factor in all industrial operation and
pig-iron production one of the basic components of heavy industry, the
growth in the production of energy and pig iron is a very good indicator of
the total industrial production.
<P>
Figure 17 is a graph plotted on a semilogarithmic scale of the
production of energy from coal, oil, gas, and water power -- from 1850 to
1969.  From 1850 to 1907 the production of energy increased exponentially
at a rate of 6.91 percent per year, with a doubling period of 10.0 years.
Then during the three-year period from 1907 to 1910, the growth rate
dropped abruptly to a mean rate of 1.77 percent per year and the doubling
period increased to 39 years.
<P>
Figure 18 is a corresponding plot of U.S. pig-iron production.  The
pig-iron curve resembles that of energy so closely that the two curves can
hardly be told from one another.  Pig-iron production also grew
exponentially at a rate close to 7 percent per year until about 1910, when
it too broke abruptly to a lower rate of less that 2 percent per year.
This abrupt break at about 1910 represents a major event in the industrial
history of the United States, yet we have barely been aware that it
happened.
<P>
In parallel with this industrial growth during most of the 19th
century and continuing until 1929, the mean monetary interest rate was also
about 7 percent per year.  Therefore until 1910 the price level, except for
temporary disturbances, should have remained comparatively stable.
Following 1910, when the physical growth rate dropped to about 2 percent
per year, whereas the interest rate remained at about 7 percent, a price
inflation at a rate of about 5 percent per year should have begun.  Despite
fluctuations, the interest rate has remained consistently higher than the
physical growth rate from 1910 to the present, which implies that we should
have had an almost continuous price inflation for the last 64 years.
<P>
A graphical illustration of the relations between the monetary
growth, physical growth and price inflation is shown in Figure 19.  The
upper straight line represents the exponential growth of money at the
interest rate i; the lower curve the physical growth at the lower rate a.
The ratio of M (money growth) to Q (industrial growth) at any given time is
proportional to the distance between those curves.  If the curves are
parallel, the spacing is constant and a stable price level will prevail.
If the curves are divergent to the right, the price level will increase at
the rate (i-a)''
<P>
These curves depict the approximate relation between the monetary
growth rate and the physical growth rate that has prevailed in the United
States since 1910.
<P>
Finally, as confirmatory evidence, there is shown in Figure 30 a
graph of the consumer price index as computed for each year from 1800 to
1971 by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.  The three principal
distortions coincide with the War of 1812, the Civil War, and World War 1.
Disregarding these, and drawing a smooth  curve under the bases of each
gives a very informative result.  For the period from 1800 to 1910 the
consumer price level remained remarkably stable.  Beginning about 1910, at
the time of the abrupt drop in the rate of industrial growth, prices began
to inflate and they have continued to do so to the present time.
<P>
The foregoing example has been discussed in detail because it
serves as a case history of the type of cultural difficulties which may be
anticipated during the transition period from a phase of exponential growth
to a stable state.  Since the tenets of our exponential-growth culture
(such as a non zero interest rate) are incompatible with a state of non
growth, it is understandable that extraordinary efforts will be made to
avoid a cessation of growth.  Inexorably, however, physical and biological
constraints must eventually prevail and appropriate cultural adjustments
will have to be made.''
<P>
During the question period after Dr. Hubbert's testimony Mr. Udall
asked,--``this inflation that we are all so concerned about now may not
necessarily be mismanagement of the economy or some temporary problems
necessarily, but may be built into this whole problem of exponential growth
in terms of the population and use of resources, and so on.
Is that what you are saying?''  Dr. Hubbert's reply was, ``It has been
going on, the record is unequivocal, since 1910, disregarding the
disturbance of World War I.''
<P>
Does Dr. Hubbert have a recommendation for the overhaul of our culture and
an alternative to money?  When I spoke to him by telephone in about 1970 he
confirmed that he did.  His suggestion was that income in units of energy
could be used.  In a 30 page research paper which he published while at
Columbia in August 1936 titled <cite>Man-Hours--A Declining
Quantity</cite>[4]  he
wrote, ``the American public has watched both government and business
indulge in the curtailment of food production and its wholesale destruction
at a time of the greatest human need in American history.  They have seen
their factories closed at a time when a large fraction of the population
has been in want of the products of industry and when millions have been
willing and anxious to work.-- What is there so difficult about the
problem?  What is it that has to be done in order to solve it?  Simply and
solely that our Continental totality shall be operated at a maximum of
efficiency with a maximum conservation of resources for the maximum
production and distribution of physical wealth--with a resultant standard
of living greater than has ever been obtained on the North American
Continent.
<p>
To do this requires a distributive mechanism that will deliver the
products of industry to the consuming public at whatever rate is required.
<P>
<h3>Getting Something For Nothing</h3>
<P>
In the distribution to the public of the products of industry, the
failure of the present system is the direct result of the faulty premise
upon which it is based.  This is: that somehow a man is able by his
personal services to render to society the equivalent of what he receives,
from which it follows that the distribution to each shall be in accordance
with the services rendered and that those who do not work must not eat.
This is what our propagandists call 'the impossibility of getting something
for nothing.'
<p>
Aside from the fact that only by means of the sophistries of
lawyers and economists can it be explained how, on this basis, those who do
nothing at all frequently receive the largest shares of the national
income, the simple fact is that it is impossible for any man to contribute
to the social system the physical equivalent of what it costs the system to
maintain him form birth till death--and the higher the physical standard of
living the greater is this discrepancy.  This is because man is an engine
operating under the limitations of the same physical laws as any other
engine.  The energy that it takes to operate him is several times as much
as any amount of work he can possibly perform.  If, in addition to his
food, he receives also the products of modern industry, this is due to the
fact that material and energy resources happen to be available and, as
compared with any contribution he can make, constitute a free gift from
heaven.
<p>
Stated more specifically, it costs the social system on the North
American Continent the energy equivalent to nearly 10 tons of coal per year
to maintain one man at the average present standard of living, and no
contribution he can possibly make in terms of the energy conversion of his
individual effort will ever repay the social system the cost of his social
maintenance.  Is it  not to be wondered at, therefore, that a distributive
mechanism based upon so rank a fallacy should fail to distribute; the
marvel is that it has worked as well as it has.
<p>
Since any human being, regardless of his personal contribution, is
a social dependent with respect to the energy resources upon which society
operates, and since every operation within a given society is effected at
the cost of a degradation of an available supply of energy, this energy
degradation, measured in appropriate physical units such as kilowatt-hours,
constitutes the common physical cost of all social operations.  Since also
the energy-cost of maintaining a human being exceeds by a large amount his
ability to repay, we can abandon the fiction that what one is to receive is
in payment for what one has done, and recognize that what we are really
doing is utilizing the bounty that nature has provided us.  Under these
circumstances we recognize that we all are getting something for nothing,
and the simplest way of effecting distribution is on a basis of equality,
especially so when it is considered that production can be set equal to the
limit of our capacity to consume, commensurate with adequate conservation
of our physical resources.
<P>
<h3>Income in Units of Energy</h3>
<P>
On this basis our distribution then becomes foolproof and
incredibly simple.  We keep our records of the physical costs of production
in terms of the amount of extraneous energy degraded.  We set industrial
production arbitrarily at a rate equal to the saturation of the physical
capacity of our public to consume.  We distribute purchasing power in the
form of energy certificates to the public, the amount issued to each being
equivalent to his pro rata share of the energy-cost of the consumer goods
and services to be produced during the balanced-load period for which the
certificates are issued.  These certificates bear the identification of the
person to whom issued and are non negotiable.  They resemble a bank check
in that they bear no face denomination, this being entered at the time of
spending.  They are surrendered upon the purchase of goods or services at
any center of distribution and are permanently canceled, becoming entries
in a uniform accounting system.  Being nonnegotiable they cannot be lost,
stolen, gambled, or given away because they are invalid in the hands of any
person other than the one to whom issued.  If lost, like a bank checkbook,
new ones may be had for the asking.  Neither can they be saved because they
become void at the termination of the two-year period for which they are
issued.  They can only be spent.
<p>
Contrary to the Price System rules, the purchasing power of an
individual is no longer based upon the fallacious premise that a man is
being paid in proportion to the so-called 'value' of his work (since it is
a physical fact that what he receives is greatly in excess of his
individual effort) but upon the equal pro rata division of the net energy
degraded in the production of consumer goods and services.  In this manner
the income of an individual is in nowise dependent upon the nature of his
work, and we are then left free to reduce the working hours of our
population to as low a level as technological advancement will allow,
without in any manner jeopardizing the national or individual income, and
without the slightest unemployment problem or poverty.''
<P>
Hubbert goes on to state that following a transition the work required of
each individual, need be no longer than about 4 hours per day, 164 days per
year, from the ages of 25 to 45.  Income will continue until death.
``Insecurity of old age is abolished and both saving and insurance become
unnecessary and impossible.''
<P>
My personal conclusions and recommendations are:
<ol>
  <li>We will never again be able to get sufficient growth of the
      economy to eliminate or even markedly reduced unemployment.
      NAFTA, GATT,  and Clinton's hope of growing the economy to solve
      unemployment is doomed to failure.
  <li>The promise of competing in the global economy is a hoax
      perpetrated upon the working and unemployed people of this
      country because over time a nation needs to buy and sell
      overseas in roughly equivalent amounts.
  <li>All attempts to reduce the deficit, balance the budget or pay
      off the national debt are futile.  The deficit and the national
      debt represent the subsidy the government has paid in its
      attempt to keep growth and unemployment at the level of social
      tolerance.
  <li>The steady state economy into which we are being inexorably forced
      implies an interest rate of zero.
  <li>An interest rate of zero (as Hubbert explains) means the end of
      the money system.  We are being forced to completely rethink
      our cultural ideas about how to organize our economy and
      distribute purchasing power.
  <li>Increasingly desperate means will be used by those who think we can
      continue to have business as usual.
  <li>The proposals of Negative Population Growth should be implemented
      immediately.
