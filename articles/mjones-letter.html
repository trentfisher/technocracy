Never before has the human race faced a situation that is anything like what it
is now facing.  We seem to be on the edge of unparalleled disaster at the peak
of our achievements.  On the one hand never have so many people lived so well,
while at the same time the future indeed appears dark.  
<p>
There is really little need for me to summarize, but to be clear it seems
necessary.  The expansion of human population across the planet cannot
continue.  Food supplies are threatened by a collapse of soil fertility, fresh
water, environmental degradation and so forth.  Crime is running rampant across
the country.  The signs of social decay are everywhere.  Our economic system is
faltering as your articles in the March/April Issue have pointed out.  How have
things gotten to this state and what can be done about it?
<p>
In the 1930's the study of economics took a serious turn for the worse.  The
horrible depression of the thirties had stimulated a great deal of thinking
about just what makes an economic system work.  Mathematical theories about the
fickle financial finaglings of the fiscal system were being developed.  In view
of the fact that almost all the economists of the day had guessed wrong,
anything that would improve the prognostication would be welcome.  So
improvement of the fiscal guesswork became a respectable profession.
<p>
Those who operated the price system at the time were very frightened that they
were about to lose their system and the benefits thereby accrued.  They lived
in fear of any explanation that appeared at variance with the beloved price
system.  The facts be damned, just keep the money coming!  The Commies were
everywhere!  The Commies of course consisted of anyone whose point of view did
not coincide with the current lords of the manor.
<p>
Into this social environment Technocracy Inc. offered not simply a different
explanation, but a completely different approach to the problems.  Technocracy
proposed the analysis of the operations of the social system by analyzing the
physical operations that made the system run.  In other words, rather than
trying to figure out how an engine is running by the sound it makes, looking at
the exhaust fumes, and watching the vibration it produces, why not try looking
at the engine itself!  What the organization proposed was to measure social
operations with energy, the most fundamental unit of anything physical.  The
laws of thermodynamics apply to the social system just like anything that has
substance.
<p>
The screams of outrage from the press both then and now, points to the fact
that Technocracy was on to something and this system is out to crush it by any
means necessary.  When socialism was popular Technocracy was called Fascist.
When fascism is popular Technocracy is called Communist. It is none of these.
The fact that the price system press finds it necessary to lie about
Technocracy just about every time it bothers to mention it testifies to just
how frightened of it they are.
<p>
Technocracy's analysis points out that the price system is destroying itself
and it really has no other choice.  This will happen whether Technocracy is
here or not. The single graph produced by the organization explains all that
really needs explaining as far as this system is concerned.  Probably the best
example is the one that is most obvious - agriculture.  In 1830 about seventy
percent of the population lived on or derived their living from the land.
Today only about three percent survive this way.  Technology has replaced them.
Today as the pace of technology quickens we see jobs disappearing by the
thousands.  The unskilled are doomed, but even professional people with good
degrees are becoming homeless!
<p>
The little chart produced by Technocracy in the 1930's is moving relentlessly
forward and it will crush this system.

man hours and production" WIDTH=564 HEIGHT=454>
<p>
Rather than see this situation as a hopeless catastrophe, Technocracy realized
that this required a change of social system and that instead of being
terrified we are being presented with the greatest opportunity the human race
has ever had!  It is we who have been given the possibility of moving the human
race into a whole new plane of social existence!
<p>
Two major conclusions evolve from this chart.  If you have the ability to
produce enough for everyone, price disappears.  Agriculture is a perfect
example of this.  When so much is produced that the price a farmer gets for his
product falls below the cost of producing it, he will go out of business.  That
is the reason so few farmers are still in business.  The other conclusion is
that machines are excellent producers but they don't consume much.  It is not
necessary to directly replace a man with a machine.  All that is really needed
is to increase the productivity of the people now working and the result is
that you need fewer people.  The end result can only lead to one place, the
destruction of the price system.
<p>
Technocracy realized that the people of North America would probably not be
willing to voluntarily starve to death in the middle of the worlds greatest
super market.  If you can't operate a price system, the simplest thing is to
find a way to do without it rather than continue to operate in an impossible
situation.  Technocracy proposed operating the social system using energy as a
basis for governing operations.  In such a system there could be no
distinctions between individuals on the basis of consuming privileges because
to do so is to reestablish a price system.  This is what people really want, an
income, not a job!
<p>
It doesn't take much reflection to realize that once a price system no longer
exists very nearly all of the trappings that constitute the present governing
system become pointless.  A government of sorts is needed but would constitute
a small fraction of what exists today.  Quite obviously the most important
requirement is to keep the technology that keeps us all alive running.  So
Technocracy proposed a structure for doing that.  The only purpose of such a
government is to provide the population with what they want where they want it.
It would function similar to an automatic elevator.
<p>
The organization itself was formed to help make the transition as smooth as
possible.  The organization attempts to do this by informing as many people as
possible about the course of events as well as warning about what will occur if
we permit our technology to be destroyed.  The organization itself has no
assumption of power theory.  That is, the organization has no plans to take
over or form any government.  Once a high energy form of government is
established, the organization disbands. We will have done our job.
