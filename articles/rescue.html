This was taken from an article written by the famous novelist, Rupert
Hughes (1872-1956).  His writings cover a wide range of subjects.  He
was author of <cite>American Composers</cite> (1900); <cite>Love
Affairs of Great Musicians</cite> (1903); and <cite>Music Lovers'
Cyclopedia</cite> (1914). His biography of President George
Washington, published in three volumes between 1926 and 1930, is
notable for its careful documentation and its studied omission of the
many popular myths concerning Washington. His novels, which attained
wide popularity, include <cite>What Will People Say?</cite> (1914);
<cite>Ladies' Man</cite> (1930); <cite>City of Angels</cite> (1941);
and <cite>The Giant Wakes</cite> (1950).  He also wrote plays for the
stage and for motion pictures.

Whenever something new is offered to the world as a cure for old
diseases, it is misrepresented by everybody concerned.  The inventor or
discoverer, like Archimedes, leaps out of the inspiring bathtub, cries
``Eureka!'' and runs all wet down the street, proclaiming the great
godsend.  Then friends and converts take the hopes and dreams of the
inventor and magnify them, twist them, and vouch for them as curealls. 
Then the enemies of all new things take alarm and begin to attack
something that the inventor never claimed and his partisans never
pretended.
<p>
Everybody makes mistakes in figures but, on catching somebody else in a
typographical or mathematical error, thinks he has finished him.  When
Sir Isaac Newton discovered the law of gravity and tried to verify it,
the great mathematician was so excited that he had to call in a friend
to do a simple bit of addition.  Yet Newton has a good name and the law
was a good thing to learn.
<p>
So it is with Technocracy, as I see it.  It is a magnificent theory, a
branch of the theory of evolution and as easy to misrepresent and get
mad at; some of its first disciples have been extremely rash and
prophetic, and its enemies are ridiculing those follies and committing
new follies of their own.  I believe that in its essence it is a true
statement of irresistible tendencies.  Before we can find a cure we need
a diagnosis.  This being correct or corrected, there is still much room
for error in the prophecy or prognosis.  But somewhere, somehow, in a
certain general direction, something waits to be done.
<p>
Technocracy means ``government by skill''; skill means wisdom based on
knowledge, knowing how to do things, especially with tools, implements,
machines, scientific devices, neat tricks.  Technocracy concerns the
management of the physical work of the world.  It has nothing to do with
the control of the fine arts, religions, philosophies, jokes,
amusements, and fashions.
<p>
Can anyone object to a rule of the world by skill?  Is it not high time
that we had a bit of it?
<p>
We have had aristocracy, autocracy, bureaucracy, democracy, ochlocracy,
plutocracy, theocracy, hierarchy, the wise and good, the mob, the
pee-pul--which means the politicians ``representing''the people.  And
today all forms of government are stuck in the mud together.
<p>
And now comes along a suggestion that we let skill run the world.  The
idea is backed up with a warning that the machine which man has invented
will serve as a Juggernaut if allowed to run wild, but will serve as a
magnificent omnibus if only everybody will get aboard and ride, each one
taking his spell at the wheel or other parts of the machinery.
<p>
Fantastic claims have been made for the new system by more or less
responsible persons, as they were made for such inventions or
discoveries as the printing press, the telegraph, telephone, phonograph,
moving picture, radio, salvarsan, diphtheria serum, insulin, and what
not.
<p>
Fantastic opposition as always arose at once.  Ridicule and furious
protest abound.  The errors or apparent errors of the enthusiasts are
held up to scorn; but as the world has both benefited and suffered from
all other great inventions, so I think it will be with Technocracy.
<p>
The earliest announcements came up in the manner of Kipling's dawn,
``like thunder.'' Press and public ran away with the idea.  We had some
over-hasty statements concerning the eminence of some of the sponsors. 
Mr. Howard Scott was the original wonder boy; he was credited with as
many degrees as an nth-degree Mason.  Then came the inevitable turning
and rending, and it was soon implied that Mr. Scott could neither read
nor write, and was probably the man who blew up the Maine and struck
Billy Patterson.
<p>
But what does it matter?  When Thomas Jefferson advocated true
democracy, equality, and the rule of the people, he was accused of
everything horrible, from fathering mulattoes to advocating general
massacre.  The clergy called him an atheist and an arch-demon.  The
president of Yale prophesied that if Jefferson were elected, American
virgins would be violated in the public squares.  In spite of that
prediction--or perhaps because of it--Jefferson swept the country by an
overwhelming majority.
<p>
When Charles Darwin put forth his theory of evolution, he and his
followers were denounced as fools, fiends, destroyers of morality, and
everything else.  But today there is no eminent scientist who does not
accept evolution as one of the gigantic facts of cosmic history.  All
along the line of the evolutionary theory there were and are things for
the critics to laugh at.  But the line holds.
<p>
The theory that the world is round was mocked and made perilous. Today
nobody would have the face to claim that the heavens revolve around a
fixed earth.
<p>
Human nature does change, slowly and with violent backslidings, but
always toward more and more recognition of human equality and the rights
of every individual to every opportunity.  A human's native abilities,
persistence, luck, and environment will determine his progress, but the
right to try is his or hers.  In ancient times the king was god, high
priest, everything.  His subjects were nothing.  His nobility were
lackeys.  Through the Middle Ages and beyond, a prince, a duke, or what
not would enrich an illegitimate son with the gift of a city, a
province, a see, and all the inhabitants with it.  If people resisted
they were impoverished or put to death.  Where there is similar atrocity
today it is at least masked under pretenses of popular benefit.
<p>
When Louis XVI was crowned, some of the laborers who built the
coronation bridge dropped dead of starvation as the procession passed in
its grandeur.
<p>
When Talleyrand was converted to the Revolution, he appealed to some of
the embattled nobility and others to pay a tax to help the poor, or at
least to give up a tax on their incomes.  He said:  ``If you don't give
part the people will take all.'' They didn't and the people did.
<p>
When our forefathers began to claim a voice in the disposal of their own
property, the conservatives in America pointed out that kings ruled by
divine right.  Washington, Franklin, and the rest did not dare dream of
independence until Tom Paine, ``wild anarchist,''deist, and fugitive from
English prisons, converted them.
<p>
Even Washington did not believe in democracy.  Jefferson was the madman
who believed that everybody high or low had an equal right to speak his
mind and vote his vote.  And property or other such qualifications for
voters were insisted on in most of the United States till at least 1830.
<p>
We can still remember the horror expressed at the thought of giving
women equality with men in the voting booths and in public life.  A
little over a century ago many prominent people thought it a sin to
teach women to read and write.
<p>
Today, in theory at least and almost everywhere about the world, the
individual has inalienable rights that can be infringed only for the
greatest good of the greatest number.
<p>
All this is leading up to one of Technocracy's most alarming
suggestions:  that everybody shall have economic equality--the same hours
of work and the same income.  Such a paradise will never quite come; of
course.  Yet we draw nearer it all the time.
<p>
Now, I love money and luxury and purple and fine linen, and I do my best
to get them without taking them from anybody else.  The fact that the
majority lack them is, to me, tragic.  Until Technocracy suggested it, I
had never imagined it possible that the world could be so managed as to
give everybody comfort and a little luxury.  Now it seems that science
has found a way to manufacture what would be called a Utopia.
<p>
Man today can do a thousand things that angels could not do a century
ago.  One man with an electric button or a lever or some device can
control so much horse power that he becomes an army.  At my old home in
Keokuk, Iowa, is a dam across the Mississippi; and the water pouring
through turbines creates a power that could run every plow and
agricultural implement in the Middle West.
<p>
A system of underground automatic irrigation of the roots of crops has
been tested and proved which may junk the whole horrible business of
plowing, harrowing, fertilizing, and what not.  Even these tasks can be
and are being done by machinery on such a vast scale that our crops are
already too large for us to manage.
<p>
Our only hope today is to get farmers to reap smaller harvests, to get
manufacturers to make less goods and use more men in the making of them;
to check short the development of agricultural and other science and
throw man backward down the long stairs of time.
<p>
TECHNOCRACY says:  ``Take the machine and buy leisure with it, buy
equality with it, let it create plenty of everything for everybody for
almost nothing.  Or else--'' Then it paints very gloomy pictures of the
future, perhaps laying the black on a bit thick.  But it is hard not to
grow melodramatic these days.
<p>
Admitting that there are errors in the Technocratic statistics--in what
human business has there ever been a lack of error?--two tremendous facts
remain:  first, machinery has been so rapidly developed in the last few
decades that new fields of employment cannot be opened rapidly enough to
take care of the man power that machines displace; second, this is true
even though the development of new machinery is hampered and checked in
numberless ways.  If science were permitted free sway, the displacement
of man power would be incalculably more rapid and unemployment would
hugely increase.
<p>
Many protest that Technocracy means the surrender of personal liberty. 
What liberty has the average man left to surrender?  Last year the
government took one fourth of every citizen's money.  This year's income
tax promises to take the skin off any prosperity anybody may have
chanced upon.
<p>
Even religious freedom is still largely restricted to certain powerful
sects.  Everywhere we turn today we find our liberty surrendered.
<p>
While it is certain that government would be altered almost beyond
recognition in the process of adoption of Technocracy, let nobody
pretend that this would be any greater or more radical a revolution than
a dozen that have already taken place in this nation of ours.
<p>
What sort of person could really want to maintain the present system of
a few having all the luxury and the vast majority the drudgery, a few
the cream, the rest only skim milk?  I am as far as possible from an
anarchist, or a communist, or a socialist.  But it warms my heart as no
other dream has ever done, to imagine everybody having the dread of
poverty removed, the hideous torments of anxiety gone, and the gates of
leisure and a little luxury opened.  
<p>
Technocracy is a plan to bring order into the present chaos and
construct a decent workaday world.
