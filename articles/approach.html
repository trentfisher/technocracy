<P>
The building of a new social order on the North American Continent
demands an entirely new technique of organization.  Technocracy is
working toward the definite objective of a new social order of
abundance and security for all--an objective that is predetermined by
the very structure of our Continental physical mechanism. A thorough
study of the current progression of North America indicates that
nothing short of this objective will satisfy the needs of our people
or the operating specifications of our technology.  This is not a
matter for compromise, as some suggest, in an effort to modify, reform
or confine the present outmoded method of social control.  It is a
gigantic problem--as large as all North America and the full impact of
modern technology--and it cannot be solved by a compromise of
agreement among many diverse opinions.  This is a problem which can only
be solved by the design and installation of a new social order.  Such
demands a new form of organization.
<P>
In most instances individuals join in voluntary association to act upon
those opinions, ideas, or beliefs which they hold in common.  These
opinions, ideas, or beliefs may or may not be in accord with facts,
although group action may and does take place in entire disregard to
facts--often with disastrous results.  Once ideas have crystallized into
organized action little question is raised or permitted as to their
feasibility or conformance to fact.
<P>
In these cases--the union of men of widely differing conditioning  with
a consequent wide range of opinion,  ideas  or beliefs--it often follows
that the objective of the group is either initially or ultimately the
result of compromise, or is, of necessity  extremely limited or general
in scope. This explains the popularity  and ineffectiveness of the
emotional approach and the political generality neither clearly states
nor adequately defines the project; both  are readily adapted by the
individual to his existing stock of ideas.
<P>
Technocracy partakes of only one of these elements in that it is
dependent on the voluntary association of individuals acting upon
certain ideas upon which they  are  in agreement.  It differs, however,
from all other social movements past and present, in that these common
ideas are not the result of philosophic agreement.  Compromise, in so
far as it may enter into the building of this Organization, must be
entirely upon the part of the individual in allying himself with the
movement.
<P>
It will be seen that the building of such a movement demands an approach
that is a direct inversion of the methods employed by all other social
movements. The emotional popularization of Technocracy's program
would mean but a temporary gain; persons drawn into a movement by such
means are good only for immediate action--rarely can they be held for a
long-term program.  This is amply illustrated by the rapid growth and
decay of the many contemporary social movements that have employed such
methods.  Technocracy's task is one of providing facts; facts upon which
all may build common ideas.  The continuation and expansion of the
research program and the wide-spread presentation of the facts gained
therefrom is part of that task.
<P>
The growth of Technocracy has followed naturally upon the formation of
common ideas based on facts. Growth by such methods has been slow but
it has been a selective process that will assure a membership of
the type required.  People who enter an organization through emotional
excitation are as readily lost to another; people who enter an
organization with an understanding and acceptance of the factual basis
of its program cannot be led astray.  Such only are deserving of the
name--Technocrat.
