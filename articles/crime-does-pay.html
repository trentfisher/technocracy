Criminal activity has now become a major segment of the U.S.  economy.
A report from the House Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Control
states: ``More than 20 million American use marijuana regularly,
approximately 8 million to 20 million are regular cocaine users, about
500,000 are heroin addicts, a million are regular users of
hallucinogens, and 6 million people abuse prescription drugs.''
Marijuana is reportedly the nations largest cash crop with sales
approaching $14 billion annually.
<p>
Not to be outdone, the take of financial swindlers is said to equal
that of the drug traffic. It seems that there are swindles for every
segment of society rich or poor illinformed or well informed. The
sophisticated prefer tax shelter schemes, victims include Woody Allen,
Erica Jong, economist Arthur Laffer, and columnist Jack Anderson. The
May issue of Forbes magazine reports that every year estimates are that
some 500 abusive tax shelter schemes are uncovered. Religious
congregations are excellent targets for bible quoting con men ready to
lead the flock to a fiscal shearing. Stock swindles are enjoying and
enthusiastic resurgence. Penalties for the financial swindlers are
usually relatively light.
<p>
Laws are enacted by society to protect the peace and tranquility of
the society and to permit its members to conduct their affairs in an
orderly and predictable manner. The framework of a society is outlined
by the structure of its laws.  The organization of society itself
exists so that people can work together in harmony for the mutual
advantage of all. When a substantial percentage of the people within a
society feel that the society offers them no advantages they often
choose to operate outside of its laws. When the percentage of people
operating outside the law becomes large the other members of the
society are forced to divert a substantial portion of their income to
defending themselves. As the process continues the society begins to
crumble.
<p>
Criminal activity provides the clearest evidence of just how much the
operation of a Price system is at odds with the best interests of the
citizens of North America. Probably no other economic sector provides
such a high return on investment:  taxes are non-existent, labor
problems don't occur, retirement plans are highly cost effective. But
what is socially redeeming about swindling a widow out of her
inheritance or providing teenagers with drugs? Open an economic niche
and some creature will crawl into it.
<p>
What kind of a society do we live in? Tranquility is virtually
non-existent. Many members of this price system society feel that they
are living on the edge of a precipice. Bank robberies according to a
report in the Wall Street Journal have leveled off at 6000 last year,
70 to 80% of these people get caught and the banks loose little. This
is up from the hundreds that occurred during the 1950's. Teenage
suicides have reached epidemic proportions and more Vietnam veterans
have died by their own hand than died in the war. Criminal activity may
well account for 15% of the activity of our whole gross national
product. Large corporations collapse suddenly with little warning.
Whole industries shudder and began shedding workers who have depended
upon their employment for a lifetime. This is a society that is tearing
itself apart.
<p>
Technocracy Inc. has been stating for over 50 years that the impact of
technological advance would be the destruction of the price system no
matter what what the form of society. Rather than viewing this as a
disaster Technocracy realizes that the human race has the opportunity
to advance to a whole new level of social development. Technocracy is
the only plan for the operation of a social system on a non-price basis
and this is the only base upon which a new society can be built.
