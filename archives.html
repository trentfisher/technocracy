<h1>Technocracy Archives</h1>

Technocracy has a massive body of literature spanning over 60 years.
I am working on getting as much online as I can, but these web pages
will never measure up to the 11 boxes of literature in my basement.
<p>
I have divided the materials here into the following categories:
<UL>
  <LI><a href="briefs/">Information briefs</a> --
      single page introductions.
  <li><a href="pamphlets/">Pamphlets, article reprints and the like</a>
  <li><a href="periodicals/">Magazines and newsletters</a>.
      Many articles and entire issues can be found here.
  <li><a href="articles/">Various articles</a> which
      cannot be placed in one of the above categories.
</ul>
<p>
I have divided everything up into individual articles, so that they
can easily be indexed and searched.  To help with this, I have set up
some automatically generated ``master indexes'' of <em>all</em>
the articles available online: 
<a href="master-index.html">sorted by title</a>,
<a href="master-author-index.html">sorted by author</a> or
<a href="master-date-index.html">sorted by date</a>.
<p>
And if that doesn't help, there is a
<a href="ghindex.html">search engine</a> available to
help find things among the hundreds of items available here.
<p>
If you're not quite sure what you are looking for, you can look at
<a href="/cgi-bin/trent/rndarticle.cgi">a random article</a>.
<p>
If, after trying the above, you cannot find what you are looking for,
<a href="mailto:trent@technocracy.org">let me know.</a>
