<h1>About This Site</h1>
<p>
This web site is an <a href="official.html">unofficial</a>
web site for Technocracy, Inc. on the Internet.  It is maintained by
<a href="people/trent-fisher.html">Trent Fisher</a>.
<p>
The <em>official</em> web site is at
<a href="http://www.technocracyinc.org">www.technocracyinc.org</a>.
<p>
My intention is for this web site to be an extensive library of
information about Technocracy, both of
<a href="archives.html">historic</a> and
<a href="pubs.html">current</a> publications.
Please see the <a href="http://www.technocracyinc.org">official web site</a>
if you are new to Technocracy and/or you have specific questions.
<p>
Every page shold have a ``navigation bar'' like the one at the top of
this page.  With it you should be able to get to some higher-level
index, or to the search page.  I hope this will make it difficult
to ``get lost''.  This should also give all Technocracy
pages a unique appearance, so they can be distingiushed from other web
pages that have incorrect or misleading information about us or
our body of thought.
<p>
I welcome any feedback about the structure of these web pages, and
ways which will make them easier for you to use.  Also if there are
materials you want to see online, let me know.  Send any such feedback
to <a href="mailto:webmaster@technocracy.org">webmaster@technocracy.org</a>.
If you have questions about Technocracy's body of thought, please
visit the <a href="http://www.technocracyinc.org">official web site</a>.

<h2>Tools</h2>
<p>
For those interested, these web pages were built using a variety of
free software, mostly <a href="http://www.fsf.org/">GNU Software</a>
(based on the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html">Linux</a>
kernel, until the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd.html">Hurd</a>
is stable enough for my purposes).
Being a Configuration Management Engineer by trade, I treat web pages
as any other sort of source code, keep it checked into a source
control system, and use GNU Make to do many of the routine tasks.
<p>
Here are the notable packages I use:
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.XCF.Berkeley.EDU/~jmacd/prcs.html">PRCS</a>
  <li>GNU Emacs, with
      <A HREF="http://www.santafe.edu/~nelson/tools">html-helper-mode</A>
      and <a href="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/elisp/w3/docs.html">W3</a>
  <li><a href="http://glimpse.cs.arizona.edu/">Glimpse</a> and
      <a href="http://glimpse.cs.arizona.edu/ghttp">GlimpseHTTP</a> 
      for the search facility
  <li><a href="http://lynx.browser.org/">Lynx</a>
  <li><a href="http://www.perl.com/perl/">Perl</a> is the language I
      use to write all my conversion filters, and other manipulation
      programs.
  <li><a href="http://www.cre.canon.co.uk/~neilb/weblint/">weblint</a>
</ul>
<p>
As for the actual web page structure and style, there were several web
pages that helped:
<a href="http://www.useit.com/">Jakob Nielsen's</a> web site, and
particularly his <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/">Alertbox</a>
column, has a wealth of information about what makes for a
<em>usable</em> web site.  In fact, I derived my ``navigation bar''
from his.
<a href="http://info.med.yale.edu/caim/manual/contents.html">
Yale C/AIM Web Style Guide</a> also has some good info.
The <a href="http://www.anybrowser.org/campaign/">Best Viewed With Any
Browser</a> page has links to many useful pages.
I could use this opportunity to rant about the browser-bigoted,
graphics intensive, java-crazed, mess that the World Wide Web is
becoming, but I will restrain myself (for the moment).
